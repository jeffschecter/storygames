I don\u2019t want to do that. I want this game to be more collaborative and emergent, with the GM and the players working together to create the story.<br/><br/>But how can I design for that and also design for satisfying mystery arcs, with clues leading up to a twist or revelation that makes sense in the game world? What tools can I give players and the GM to make that happen? And are there any systems out there that do this well that I should look at?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hyades" title="hyades"><img alt="hyades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/458/nC00J8GI62UXP.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hyades">hyades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476285/#Comment_476285" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T09:42:37+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  9:42AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have a look at this thread: Myth Arcs in GMless Games (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/472969" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/472969</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476286/#Comment_476286" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T09:57:48+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  9:57AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2018 10:00AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The basic theory for this sort of thing is that you need to offer the "clues" (facts that establish the puzzle) in an appealing yet clear way, and then you need to make space for the players to fit those clues together. Whatever they come up with is the answer to the mystery. It may help doing the design if you think of this as providing the players with a bunch of jigsaw puzzle pieces that they're asked to put together, except you just chose those puzzle pieces randomly, and not from the same puzzle even. It's just that instead of physical pieces that fit together in various ways you have clues to an event they are trying to put together.<br/><br/>To get more specific, you could also "test" the solution the players choose. Maybe the first solution they think up <i>proves</i> false when the characters try to act according to it, in which case this fact alone becomes another puzzle piece; the true solution has to account for it as well as the rest of the pieces. This could easily occur when the characters try to solve the puzzle before finding all the pieces.<br/><br/>Because you're providing puzzle pieces without knowing what the full picture looks like, it's possible that what you provide has no good solutions - the pieces instead of closing off possibilities until a clear picture emerges close of <i>all</i> possibilities, becoming a paradoxical impossibility. For those situations your game process also needs a way for the characters to discard puzzle pieces: further investigation proves that one or more of the clues are red herrings, planted lies, misunderstandings. The dropped piece doesn't need to be the most conflicting one; often it's more interesting if it is a less controversial piece that gets eliminated.<br/><br/>You could implement all this by simply saying that the GM is an endless reservoir of new puzzle pieces: the players can pump new clues by doing more investigation, and they can continue doing this until they have enough for a solution - which necessarily occurs sooner or later as the GM provides new information. Or, you could say that there are a specific number of clues, and that's all that can be discovered. They may not be enough for a detailed solution, but perhaps they will point a way for getting the rest of the way on guess-work? Or, maybe the mystery could be left unresolved despite the effort, that's something the genre is familiar with as well.<br/><br/>There is a game in doing this sort of thing, no doubt. As far as I know there is no true master implementation out there yet, though. <i>Dirty Secrets</i> comes closest that I can think of, but it's got other stuff going in it, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476294/#Comment_476294" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T14:59:08+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  2:59PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In essence, Eero is describing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning" rel="nofollow">abductive reasoning</a>. You needn't even create the 'clues' that the players fit together to invent the solution. Rather, you can simply provide the starting state--the 'scene of the crime--and then let them come up with the clues as they ask themselves (you) questions. For example:<br/>* There's a body on the floor and a window is obviously broken from the outside and left open.<br/>* A player supposes that there could be clues outside the window, under it (say, in the shrubbery?).<br/>* You ask them what they think they might find.<br/>* They suppose footprints or physical evidence snagged on the shrubbery. Good Idea! Yes, there's footprints.<br/><br/>...and so forth. Almost like a story jam where you Say Yes a lot. Alternately, you could hook into system using (hidden) 'Investigation' rolls to determine if their 'found' clues are relevant or red herrings... but be warned about too many red herrings, unless plot twisting is you jam ("No, the GARDENER didn't do it! You've been chansing a grroundling when, clearly, what left by the window NEVER TOUCHED THE GROUND!"). Just know that more red herrings means a MUCH longer resolution. Further, you could also hook into 'Deduction' rolls to verify or falsify their solution (as opposed to the Say Yes/Good Idea automatic validity in the bullets above). But again: More delay, more twists, longer resolution time.<br/><br/>But either way, when they have an 'airtight case' after accumulating 'found clues' and propose a solution (in finest confrontation scene tropes), then if/when it is correct... roll initiative. ;^)<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476297/#Comment_476297" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T16:48:27+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  4:48PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2018 4:49PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out InSpectres as a seminal entry in this field, though it has its problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476300/#Comment_476300" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T18:16:14+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  6:16PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great advice and suggestions for games &amp; other threads to look at \u2013 thanks, all!<br/><br/>The idea of abductive reasoning and the puzzle piece metaphor make a lot of sense. And playing with the idea of red herrings is really smart. I\u2019ve actually stopped including pre-planned red herrings when I GM mystery games, because the PCs always latch onto them and invest them with all kinds of meaning. And once they\u2019ve done that, it seems mean to say, "No, that means nothing\u201d, when I could instead reward them for innovative thinking, so I always end up making their red herring ideas \u201ctrue\u201d in the end. So really, it seems like all I have to do design-wise is formalize that process as part of the actual rules. And having the red herring as an out for clues that don\u2019t fit is a very smart solution for loose ends that the players can\u2019t logic into some kind of story pattern.<br/><br/>So it seems like that\u2019s my solution \u2013 present clues that fit with the world, let players piece them together, and allow their solution to be narratively true. And it should fit nicely into the PbtA idea of \u201cplay to find out what happens.\u201d My follow-up is: Is there any way to bake that into the game mechanically, beyond laying it out procedurally as GM advice? Does it even need to be done mechanically?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476306/#Comment_476306" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T20:08:30+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  8:08PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started designing a game utilizing the approach you seem to have settled on here, but I ended up with another kind of who-dunnit game that we\u2019ve had some real fun with. So the original mechanical idea I had hasn\u2019t been further developed. Here it is:  dixit... kinda. The voting mechanic of the card game dixit really. <br/>My idea was intended to make mystery stories a possibility for gmless games. I think it might work better w a gm though. Here\u2019s the Just:  each clue revealing scene would contain 3 or so things connecting to something in a previous scene. These could be made up on the fly. At the end of the scene these clues would be voted on in a secret ballot going to gm.  Vote for two. The gm will secretly choose a clue that got some but not all votes and will make it the useful clue.  The group won\u2019t know which one is selected though. Any clue that got votes from everyone will become a red herring. The gm will need to think of a good story/rationale to justify the red herring and will need to weave this into the story.  The next scene should offer opportunities to recognize/deduce that the red herring is just that. The useful clue is the one you use to build the next clue in the next scene.   This means that the game will involve following up multiple leads w some getting pruned off the possibility tree.   <br/><br/>Anyway, that was the basic idea. Make any use of it that you see fit. <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Davey                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476319/#Comment_476319" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-23T01:16:43+00:00" title="August 23, 2018  1:16AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We Used to Be Friends likewise addresses this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476338/#Comment_476338" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-23T14:34:32+00:00" title="August 23, 2018  2:34PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/davey">@davey</a> \u2013 Cool system!

I think there are many potential roles, but two really clear ones:\n<ul><li>The players try to solve the mystery.</li>\n<li>Solving the mystery is not attempted; rather, the role of the mystery is purely narrative, to entertain the participants and provide some inspiration for fictional situations in play.</li></ul>\nIt seems clear to me that you aren't going for the former.  I think you're going for the latter, but I'm not positive, as many people who attempt what you're attempting want some blend of both.<br/><br/>My thoughts on the matter are these:\n<ul><li>Blending both is very hard, but if you can keep the players correctly oriented at all times, so that solving efforts are rewarded and fruitless solving efforts aren't attempted, then it can be a lot of fun.</li>\n<li>With absolutely zero ability to pursue the "real truth" of a mystery, "mystery" loses its value.  Players aren't invested in pursuing answers they just get to make up later; and randomly-generated content doesn't produce good stories; and as plot frameworks go, "it's a mystery!" doesn't inherently have any of the rising action we usually expect and prefer.</li></ul>\nNot trying to discourage your endeavor, just throwing out some cautions that I hope might help you zone in on what exactly you want the "mystery" element to provide.  Examples:\n<ul><li>In <i>Animal Crime</i>, the point of the mystery is to riff of mystery fiction tropes, hilariously contrasting their seriousness with the cartoony element of sentient animals.</li>\n<li>In <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/The_Eye_in_the_Pyramid.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Eye in the Pyramid</a>, the point of the mysteries is for everyone to spout clever or funny conspiracy theories about what's really going on.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476372/#Comment_476372" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T16:29:36+00:00" title="August 24, 2018  4:29PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out City of Mist for PbtA rules about clues.

This is the immediate issue.  This is mandatory.<br/><br/>The second, optional issue is: <b>why</b> have these things been happening? This is part of the larger picture that may be played out over multiple sessions.<br/><br/>I say mandatory and optional, because the problem with mysteries is: how do things progress?  failure to look for, find and correctly interpret 'clues' are story blockers.  Clues kind of suck in that way.  Too many opportunities for 'nothing happens'.<br/><br/>So the How clues are all given to the players - it doesnt matter what they do, you will force feed them breadcrumbs to advance the story.  THEY come up with the places they look, the people they talk to, etc...  And you just roll with it - keep feeding them unambiguous information about how to progress the 'how'.  NPCs are your best bet for this.  Eventually, they will be able to put a stop to the bad things happening (at least in the short term).  The uncertainty exists in two areas - what does it cost them to stop the bad things, and ...<br/><br/>But Why?  They killed/captured the murder/kidnapper/monster/whatever - but <b>why</b> was he kidnapping left handed blonde children or stealing ancient african artifacts?  wtf knows?  This is optional as far as progressing the story from an initial situation thru to an end of session conclusion.  This is where you can lay ambiguous, uncertain to find clues that <b>you</b> dont need to know the meaning of yourself (yet)  Let the players find them if they look for them and listen as they discuss what this all might mean.  Eventually, over a series of related sessions, you yourself can come to a conclusion about the greater story of <b>why</b>.<br/><br/>A really cool part of mysteries is after you as a group come a conclusion about why all this stuff is happening, you can point back towards earlier scenarios and go 'ah, thats why they needed to be left handed!'<br/><br/>Its like the TV series LOST, yeah?  Every week some crazy shit happened, and things advanced in the immediate term during an episode, but nobody, including the writers, knew why any of it was happening for the first several seasons I bet.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476404/#Comment_476404" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-25T11:47:02+00:00" title="August 25, 2018 11:47AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2018 11:47AM by DeReel.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This Lost way of putting the meaning in the beginning, without certainty that there will be one in the end, can go wrong.

You've got what I would call a <b>Whodunit</b>, where you're presented with an array of clues and possibilities, some of which are valid and some of which aren't, and the goal is to figure out which of the possibilities is the correct answer. You might also call this a branching mystery. An Agatha Christie novel is a classic example of this. Then there's what I would call a <b>Breadcrumb Mystery</b>, where you don't initially know what's going on, but you gradually uncover a trail of clues that leads you to the answer. You might also call this a linear mystery. Doctor Who episodes are usually structured like this.<br/><br/>I'm very much going for Breadcrumb Mystery in my design intent. I mostly agree with <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> that players won't be invested in answers they make up later \u2013 <i>if</i> they're playing a Whodunit. If the game is, you have an array of clues, some are valid and some aren't, and we're generating both what the clues are and which ones are valid on the fly, then solving which set of clues \u2013 which path \u2013 is the correct one is meaningless because the game treats every path as equally valid. But a Breadcrumb Mystery doesn't have this problem, because, narratively speaking, all possibilities always collapse into a single valid path. This gets at what you by "fruitless solving efforts aren't attempted," yes?<br/><br/>So I'm definitely trying to get players to "solve the mystery", but they should be doing so by following one clue to the next to the next. I'm just also trying to square this with the PbtA "play to find out what happens" ethos. I want players to pull the string and follow the trail back to the solution to the mystery, but I don't want the GM to have that solution planned beforehand, I want it to arise through play.<br/><br/>Lost \u2013 specifically the Lost writer's room \u2013 seems like a good touchstone here. I've never watched the show, but I've talked to a number of friends who have. They've specifically told me about interviews where the writers said, "Yeah, we didn't know any of the answers, we just wrote something cool in the moment and relied on our own future ingenuity to make it work later." I want to build a game that supports doing <i>that</i>. Though I'd definitely be interested in <a href="/forums/profile/DeReel%27s">@DeReel's</a> thoughts about how front-loading meaning without direction can go wrong.<br/><br/>Right now, the best solution I've arrived at, based on this thread and my experience GM-ing pre-planned Breadcrumb Mystery plots, is to lean into PbtA's "ask questions and build on the answers" principle. So in a scene, the GM should say to the players something like, "You notice something is out of place here \u2013 what is it?" And then their answer becomes either the seed of a new mystery, or a clue that represents the next step in an existing mystery. Then whatever way the players are able to fit that new piece of information into the overall picture becomes canon \u2013 or, if the GM has thought of something else (or thinks of something else later), it was a misdirect or belonged to a different mystery.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? Is there a better or more formalized way to do that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476414/#Comment_476414" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-25T20:33:27+00:00" title="August 25, 2018  8:33PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2018 9:14PM by DeReel.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Throwing out dramatic events and characters with no idea what will happen in the end can go wrong in that it will lead to a disappointing ending, Even Lynch gets this sometimes, and my is he skillful. <br/>Maybe I don't need to explain this : just recall the zillions of bad stories who's ending did disappoint you.

Without going into deeper theory nitpickery, a succinct overview of my understanding:<br/><br/>It is possible to create entertaining stories essentially piece by piece by ensuring that the modular components individually possess artistic virtue. Roleplaying games do this a lot, but it's done in other formats as well. For example, if you have a good character, that character can work essentially by itself: you put that character in any situation, anything at all, and the story's going to have <i>some</i> heat thanks to the character's virtues. Imagine just throwing say Sherlock Holmes into anything at all - you have something there just because Sherlock is a nice character; a farcical parody if nothing else. The same is possible with things like milieus, plot structure, expressive style... they can be treated as independent and arbitrary modules while still retaining some artistic merit.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there are truly mature art forms out there where the quality culture has grown to be truly impeccable in regards to the overall shape of the piece. The novel is a good example due to how popular it's been for the last hundred years, how many have been made, how effective the critical establishment has been, and how much money has been riding on that quality. The consequence has essentially been that what we require of a novel is a rounded, all-around excellence: having good characters is a <i>minimum</i> requirement, and there is not a single aspect to the work where you can afford to be anything but professional-grade if you wish to create something that matches to the expectations of the audience. What's more, the elements of the work absolutely have to harmonize aesthetically when you're writing a novel: harmonious interaction gives an unified artistic work what amounts to a boost in quality compared to a haphazard work, which means that even if you have some truly excellent stuff to contribute (a really good story idea, for example), it is impossible for your work to match up next to a professional-quality one unless you also master the emergent value of creating a harmonized overall presentation where absolutely everything in the work has been calculated to fit. Sherlock Holmes won't make a random appearance in a good novel; if he's there, there's a deep intent to it.<br/><br/>The interplay of these two phenomena - aspects of a work having merit while it also being possible to create truly unified works with emergent value - means that different artistic cultures and mediums put weight on different aspects of the creative process depending on what the art is like in each case. This is important because the roleplaying art, when interpret as a narrative artform, is <b>very different</b> to how novels or movies or comic books are put together. The rpg activity is immediate, improvisational, interactive, and it should be obvious how these qualities impact the way storytelling works in roleplaying games: a well-crafted unity of form, so prized in writing and movies, is essentially an impossible ideal for an art form like this. Roleplaying is more like musical improvisation or a dance hall experience; authentic, personal, ever-shifting. Harmonizing in the sense I mean here <b>can</b> occur, and it's truly a great surprise when it does, but you can't count on it. Much of the art of game design is about harmonizing the players in a way that still retains the immanent virtues of the form, so it doesn't turn into simple co-writing of a novel.<br/><br/>For storytelling in roleplaying games I would argue that it is very much realistic and reasonable to adopt a relatively loose and haphazard story design, much more so than would ever be possible for a novel. There are many roleplaying games that do precisely this, very intentionally: their preparations focus very hard in creating compelling modular content that will contribute value to the final product, but the connections between the pieces are kept loose, enabling the players/performers to combine and recombine their material flexibly as the game experience takes shape. This type of storytelling definitely loses out on the emergent values of matching <i>this</i> character to <i>this</i> story with <i>these</i> clever foreshadowing elements and <i>this</i> well-prepared climatic scene; however, on balance we gain the very heart of what makes rpgs interesting and relevant: extreme interactivity, personalization and creative audience participation. The virtues are on a level that a novel or movie can absolutely never reach, but the price for that should be clear: we're going to miss out on opportunities to carefully match elements so each complements the other. The storytelling's going to be rough and spontaneous compared to a novel.<br/><br/>I'll mention a few games that work exactly like this, "throwing events and characters together to make a kewl story": <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, <i>Apocalypse World</i>, <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, <i>Dust Devils</i> and <i>Fiasco</i> are all games that seem to occasionally produce what the participants have considered "good stories" despite explicitly including instructions for play that literally consist of little except an exhortation for the GM (or the group) to prep some compelling fictional ideas, for the players to create some interesting characters, and for the group to put all that stuff into a pot and see what comes out, metaphorically speaking. These games definitely fail to produce a well-coordinated novel or movie story, with regular dramatic arc, unambiguous protagonists and consistently developed thematic arguments. I would, nevertheless, disagree if somebody said that they do not create good stories. The stories are good, they just have to be gauged in their own art form, not compared to what a story is like in a novel. (Or if you insist on comparing, at least do the rpg replay the favour of editing it to shape. It's less than a first draft, after all - it's just a story jam! Have that novelist do one of those and see how he does before insisting on a rpg session to harmonize well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476418/#Comment_476418" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-25T23:58:18+00:00" title="August 25, 2018 11:58PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2018 1:08AM by DeReel.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course you can find good stories without the closure I describe (Don Quixote, The castle, Twin Peaks s1, Le fant\xf4me de la libert\xe9) and also story games with a strictly framed ending (The mountain witch, Fiasco, Call of Cthulluh).

A "satisfying story" in an RPG will be much like a "satisfying mystery" I think. As long as the players feel like their actions lead to meaningful consequences, it works.<br/><br/>I often watch terrible sci-fi and Fantasy series and think, "there are some good ideas here but they are implemented so poorly!" But, at the same time I think "this would make a great RPG!" That's preciously because an RPG story and a Novel story serve different purposes. <br/><br/>If you want to present a singular vision, a world and story with clear artistic intent that makes its consumers feel a particular way, come to specific conclusions, <i>write a novel </i>.<br/><br/><i>But</i>, if your goal is to ask lots of interesting open-ended questions and let other people come up with their own answers, then write an RPG.<br/><br/>My point is that a "satisfying mystery" in an RPG just has to be one that everyone involved had a <i>meaningful</i> participation in uncovering, and one that doesn't feel so bonkers than it breaks anyone's suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>That doesn't put RPG story on a lower level of quality, it just means it has a different set of goals on it outset. <br/><br/><i>***Lost might be a great example for me here, it might have been a bad show in regards to a satisfying television mystery, but might have made a great RPG</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476424/#Comment_476424" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-26T08:33:58+00:00" title="August 26, 2018  8:33AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">@Kenny_J</a>  a great rpg, right up until the players, exasperated at the end of their 30th session ask the gm - ok, what actually IS going on here?   and the GM replies - I have no idea!<br/><br/>justifiable homicide ensues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476425/#Comment_476425" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-26T10:41:40+00:00" title="August 26, 2018 10:41AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/stefoid" rel="nofollow">stefoid</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">@Kenny_J</a>  a great rpg, right up until the players, exasperated at the end of their 30th session ask the gm - ok, what actually IS going on here?   and the GM replies - I have no idea!<br/><br/>justifiable homicide ensues.</p></div></blockquote>\nThe desire for an absolutely true answer is completely understandable. However, life in its myriad ways does not always provide. <br/><br/>But seriously, in real life how often do we get a completely verifiably true answer. Of all the great mysterious that are out there how many have non-fictional answers, fiction of one kind or another.<br/><br/>I do agree though that a satisfying game should involve some sort of satisfying answer to the mystery. In this context a satisfying answer is one that fits the evidence right? I guess their's nothing to be done about the potential doubt, Is there ever really a way to know the truth for sure?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476426/#Comment_476426" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-26T11:29:00+00:00" title="August 26, 2018 11:29AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/stefoid" rel="nofollow">stefoid</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">@Kenny_J</a>  a great rpg, right up until the players, exasperated at the end of their 30th session ask the gm - ok, what actually IS going on here?   and the GM replies - I have no idea!<br/><br/>justifiable homicide ensues.</p></div></blockquote>\nMore specifically regarding your comment...<br/><br/>-30 sessions!? If someone sat through that amount of time the must have been having fun on some level.<br/><br/>--30 sessions!? If they weren't having fun they clearly lacked the ability to walk away from a bad gaming table, and therefore they had a bigger problem than an unsatisfying mystery...<br/><br/>-Finally, isn't the OP about making a satisfying mystery where the GM doesn't know?

As I said earlier I cannot think of a game that would've made this type of mystery structure into the centerpiece of the game, but the basic activity is practically omnipresent in many shared storytelling games anyway. If you don't have a GM, particularly, the story creation in many games necessarily becomes a matter of first producing interesting stuff and then discovering the connections between the elements, revealing the story that was there "all along". I used to call the moment when the story "resolves" in this sense the "genesis moment"; it's very distinctive in e.g. Zombie Cinema, because when the players come to a concord over what the story is "about", the creative direction of play changes to seek resolution; instead of introducing new stuff in an essentially random way, the players start developing the existing elements instead to resolve the conflicts established between them.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DBB" rel="nofollow">DBB</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>My follow-up is: Is there any way to bake that into the game mechanically, beyond laying it out procedurally as GM advice? Does it even need to be done mechanically?</p></div></blockquote>\nYou could mechanize - formalize - much of this, yes. For example, you could have the GM define clues as discrete, modular game components that are manipulated explicitly. The game could place requirements on scenario generation, say: "A medium-length scenario has 5 GM-prepped clues." This being PbtA, you could have GM moves like "reveal a clue", and player moves like "discover a clue", all explicit. "Discard a clue" would be a powerful and necessary move in case the mystery grows too tangled, of course, or as a GM twist that reveals a clue to be a false one.<br/><br/>All this becomes much more concrete if the individual clues are written down on separate slips. This enables the group to add new ones visually, and remove false clues, and group the clues in various ways as the players attempt to fit them together. Most importantly, such props help the players be absolutely clear about what elements in the continuous narrative "count as clues"; this is often not completely obvious to less talented players, necessitating constant reiteration.<br/><br/>The actual process of play would also have a very clear formal arc: the scenario begins with investigation scenes, because you cannot solve a mystery without discovering what the mystery is about. Once the players have a minimal number of clues they can start attempting to solve, but trying it too soon risks having the GM reveal a contradictory clue that proves their solution wrong. Either way, through investigation and failed solving attempts, the players gather enough clues to discover a true solution - defined as a solution that accounts for all the clues on the table. Once this occurs, there might be an action sequence of some sort, depending on the genre and the particulars of the mystery; it's not uncommon for mystery stories that the revelation of the secret is immediate cause for some sort of action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476438/#Comment_476438" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-27T13:43:10+00:00" title="August 27, 2018  1:43PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can check out <br/><a href="http://www.theravenking.com/game-avem.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theravenking.com/game-avem.html</a><br/><br/>It's based on my two page game <b>The Murder of Mr. Crow</b>, that doesn't come up with an all satisfying story.

Here's an -incomplete- idea for the starting random table:<br/><br/><b>Crime</b> (here would be a list of possible crimes, I've got one somewhere but can't find it right now)<br/><br/>Roll 1d6<br/>1-2 It's revealed at the start of the game<br/>3-4 Serial crime, players must piece out a profile of the criminal and his/her modus operandi to stop it<br/>5-6 There are but a few clues that a crime has/it's being/will be commited.<br/><br/><b>Perpetrator</b><br/>Roll 1d6-1 to find out how many suspects. The criminal may even not be among them.<br/><br/>You would need further tables to create 3 details surrounding the suspects, crime scene, and primary clues, but otherwise you can totally rely on the players questions to come up with further clues, scenes and twists. Play to find what happens.<br/><br/>Amazingly useful tool here: Tenra Bansho's Emotional Matrix. Basically, PCs and NPCs will have an emotional response to their presence, actions, questions, etc. Emotional reactions are clues too, so they will help to tie things together.<br/><br/>Otherwise all I see missing to make this work is a mechanic and a clear way to define the endgame. The way I see it:<br/><br/>-The more the PCs mess up with the mistery, the more and more nervous the culprit will be. In PbtA's tradition that would be a Clock, right? First of culprit reactions would be "pretend you don't know a thing", then "try to hide or mess with the evidence", next "do something against whoever seems to be getting close" and then "get the hell out of there". The last part of the clock will mark that the culprit got away.<br/><br/>Of course, this doesn't mean the case isn't solved. Players will get the full picture at the end, but not closure if they take too much time.<br/><br/>-All players and the GM need to keep a list of questions to answer: What, who, why, how? When the GM decides one of the answers on his list is definitive, the clock of the criminal moves one step. The idea here is that the GM should use all the material provided by the players as inspiration to get the answers right, to have everything make sense. Rolls to determine if a piece of information is right or not should happen only when the GM isn't sure about one of the answers, but as soon as something is written down the GM should give a straight answer, no roll needed. It would be the same with the emotional matrix. <br/><br/>The general idea is that random input should only happen when there's uncertainty and stop when things are defined to help everything come to a rational conclusion.<br/><br/>-To challenge the players a bit more, the setting may demand that they get proof of whatever they suspect. This could give the culprit enough time to try to escape.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DBB" rel="nofollow">DBB</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"You notice something is out of place here \u2013 what is it?" </p></div></blockquote>\nExcellent provocative question, you need more of these! I'll help a bit:<br/><br/>-Something important is missing here. What is it?<br/>-This is too obvious, could it be made like this on purpose?<br/><br/>Also, there are the classic questions the players should always keep in mind<br/>-Who may benefit from this?<br/>-Follow the money<br/>-Somebody commits a crime. What does that person do to hide it?<br/><br/>Hope any of this helps.

Thanks all! Really love seeing everyone\u2019s varying thought process on this and digging into some of the suggested mechanics and existing mystery games.<br/><br/>Reading through has really clarified my thinking about what I even mean by \u201cmystery\u201d and the ways in which I\u2019d like that to interface with the design. I\u2019m definitely trying to bake in \u201cmystery as a <i>driver</i> of narrative\u201d, rather than \u201cmystery <i>as</i> narrative\u201d. By which I mean, I\u2019m much more interested in getting players invested in questions that they solve by taking action, rather than questions they solve by examining available evidence. Less Poirot or Sherlock, more Sam Spade or Blade Runner (not that I\u2019m trying to design noir, mind you). So there should be clues and the players should be following them back to a resolution that reconciles those clues, but the story is about what they do to get the clues and what the clues prompt them to do subsequently rather than the clues themselves.<br/><br/>Given that, the more I think about overly mechanical solutions, the less I like them (for what I\u2019m doing \u2013 I love some of these suggestions for a detective game). It\u2019s starting to seem to me as if baking the clues into the game moves (at least on the player side) will put the players in the wrong mindset. I\u2019d rather give the GM tools to establish mysteries and let the players solve them by taking action in ways that are themed to the setting (rather than ways that are themed to the mystery genre). To that end, I think the scene framing questions are the most useful tool.<br/><br/>I actually did an early draft playtest yesterday, and it went exactly as some of you predicted \u2013 I asked the players what was out of place in the starting scene, they threw out suggestions, I built on them, and  by the end we had a nice little mystery on our hands, with multiple clues that all hung together in a cohesive structure. They really didn\u2019t need much prodding to do it, and I\u2019ve already figured out a solution that explains the whole mystery we invented. (And if they come up with a different solution in a future session, we can just pivot to that, or I can use my \u201cactual\u201d solution as a twist reveal.)<br/><br/>The other major tool that I\u2019ve really neglected to consider here is what happens in between play. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s contrary to the spirit of my endeavor (create cohesive mysteries from emergent storytelling) for the GM to do planning between sessions or during a break in play. Generating the puzzle pieces on the fly and then stepping back to see how they might fit together is totally in line with \u201cplay to see what happens,\u201d as long as the GM remains open to the other good solutions that will inevitably arise at the table. So that should get baked into the GM rules &amp; advice. I think explicitly including some advice to the effect that players are smart and they\u2019ll figure out how to make things work at the table, and the GM is smart and they\u2019ll figure out how to make things work between games would go a long way.<br/><br/>As a philosophical side note, I can\u2019t help but wonder if audience disappointment at media where mysteries don\u2019t end in satisfying conclusions is a case of internal vs external processing. By which I mean, when you\u2019re external to the story (an audience watching a tv show) you\u2019re trying to solve the mystery but you don\u2019t have any say in how it unfolds. So if it goes a way you dislike, you\u2019re bummed. But if you\u2019re participating in the story (a player in an RPG), then you\u2019re an active creator. Even if the mystery unfolds in a way that wouldn\u2019t make sense to an external observer, you\u2019re satisfied, because you created the thing. It doesn\u2019t seem fragile or weird or nonsensical, because you built up the whole thing from the inside and you did it the way you wanted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476450/#Comment_476450" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-28T10:57:35+00:00" title="August 28, 2018 10:57AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" rel="nofollow">JonatanK</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>There's a Swedish game of Film Noir mysteries that does this called Nerver av st\xe5l (Nerves of steel): <a href="http://www.rollspel.nu/forum/main-category/rollspelsmakande/190887-promotion-korrl%C3%A4s-nerver-av-st%C3%A5l-du-borde-l%C3%A4sa-mitt-spel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rollspel.nu/forum/main-category/rollspelsmakande/190887-promotion-korrl\xe4s-nerver-av-st\xe5l-du-borde-l\xe4sa-mitt-spel</a><br/><br/>I don't know how accessible it is through google translate. <a href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">@Simon_Pettersson</a> wrote it, so maybe he has some interesting perspective here?</p></div></blockquote>\nThanks for mentioning this today at lunch, Jonatan! I'd have missed it otherwise.<br/><br/>Yes, NAS absolutely does this, and it does it in a beautiful way that flabbergasts me every time. As in, it's so much better than pre-planned mysteries. The mysteries are better. Doing it in this way, where nobody knows the answer, guarantees that the mystery works the way a mystery should work. The red herrings are always believed until they are proven false. The surprising twists are always surprising. Chechov's gun is always fired. All loose ends are always tied up (except when you deliberately leave one piece unsolved, for an open ending). I think it's pretty close to impossible to have such a satisfying mystery story when running pre-planned, at least without some serious illusionism. NAS is the most elegant and solid game I've ever written (sorry for tooting my own horn). Pretty much every game I've played ended up with the feeling that "this could be a movie, scene by scene".<br/><br/>There are two keys to making this happen. One is documentation. After every scene, you write down any questions the audience is thinking about. "Who killed Lawrence?", "Why was he killed?", "What's in that mysterious box?", "Who has the nazi gold now?". You also cross out all the questions that have been answered in the scene. Then, when setting a new scene, you look at the paper. Can you answer one or two of the open questions? Or, if there are few open questions and a lot of time left, you introduce new questions.<br/><br/>The other key is rigorous adherence to logic and continuation. Any time something happens which doesn't seem to fit with what's already been established, the scene is paused and we talk it out. "You just said that Jones ran out the door, but previously we established that she's blind." Perhaps I just forgot she's blind. Or perhaps it was intentional. "She must have been faking it!" Either way, you absolutely must not let any plot holes slip by.<br/><br/>There is of course more things to know about how to do this, what questions to write down, when to cross them out, how to think, etc, but that's the basics. If people are interested, I'd be happy to do one of those "Simon explains how his game works" threads, which I've done before with "Svart av kval, vit av lust" and "Utpost". The game is not likely to come out in English translation, however, unless someone else does it. Perhaps French, though! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Oh, it's GM-less, though. Might be harder to do it with a GM.
