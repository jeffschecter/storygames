If people aren't getting the spirit of cooperation, tell them they shouldn't play. If they have specific questions, you can answer them, but saying "I don't get this document" doesn't help you make it clearer to them. They can't even cooperate for basic communication with you; that does not bode well for them cooperating with a group of people to coordinate games and let you know what to prep.<br/><br/>My feeling is that the people who "get" that document are your target audience. Don't sweat the people who don't get it.

Similarly, I wish I didn't live 3400 miles away. I think it reads well as written - and I had to look twice to see where you're cooperation expectation was in it, since it seems such a frickin' obvious thing about any game / social gathering / life / whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd be wary of thinking pessimistically about your player - and also wary of saying "It's my way or the highway" until you know exactly what his position is.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither (a) he doesn't agree with cooperating with other groups, and reads the 'west marches' style as a competitive who's-player-is-the-best tournament.<br/>\n<br/>\nor (b) he isn't clear on what you mean, but has no problem with everyone cooperating to explore the region - it's just a bigger shared imagined space to explore in, that you get a bit at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd assume (b), and ask him what parts of it he wants clarity on before giving him any. It may be he's missed a few things - maybe direct him to ars ludi's original West Marches posts, to let him know what he's getting into. Or just say, look, all it says is "don't dick on other players." Or tell him he could join in whenever, and if he's not sure what it means, wait and see, follow it on the boards and the blog, and he's welcome any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it really is (a), then, yeah, it's probably not the game for him (maybe he's after World of Warcraft? no, seriously...) but there's no reason to bitch on him - there'll be other games, probably even ones you'll want to run - that want him as a player.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd say the fact that he's queried it in itself makes him more likely to be (b) - he's initiated a dialogue, after all. It might just be me, too, but this kind of conversation (ie the one between you and the player) is usually best played by people actually talking to each other - rather than email or posting on forums. I realise that has time/effort implications that might rule it out, but it might be easier in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Guy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223985/#Comment_223985" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T10:26:31+00:00" title="August 11, 2009 10:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2009 10:32AM by Ry.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's definitely not a), it's really him worried that someone else will come to the table thinking that it's more fun to kill the other PCs and take their stuff.
