In Codex, a picture, short story or poem can simultaneously describe a part of the world and a character attribute. Blue, Green and Red books let players develop a cohesive setting for themselves."<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/226582" rel="nofollow">Moros Role-Playing Game</a> Looks a little generic by the description. Says there's a free sample, but I can not find it.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/377803" rel="nofollow">Correlya</a><br/>"Correlya, 2nd Edition, is the culmination of 6 years of independent game design. It is a full-length role-playing game complete with all the rules needed for immediate play. This core book also details the fantasy world of Correlya in extravagant detail. If you are looking for a cutting-edge, rules-savvy, intelligent role playing game, look no further. Take a sneak preview for a bit of what this game has to offer!"<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/639913" rel="nofollow">Signature</a><br/>"Use Signature for Star Wars, King Arthur, The Three Musketeers, and more! Less than an half hour's customization time per setting! No dice required! Easy, fun character generation emphasizing defining traits! Let the rules be your servant, not your master!"<br/><br/>Anyone have knowledge of any of the above?  Any other independent games out there that look unique or that people are looking for more info on?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105206/#Comment_105206" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-28T11:55:31+00:00" title="October 28, 2007 11:55AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Malcolm, tell us more about Codex!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105210/#Comment_105210" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-28T13:23:21+00:00" title="October 28, 2007  1:23PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Codex is essentially an extension of the blue book concept for games where writing is at the centre of play. Characters are described using player-developed aspects of the setting. You can see sample PCs <a href="http://mobunited.livejournal.com/3031.html#cutid1" rel="nofollow">here.</a> I made them using Wikipedia, but you can simply use pure fiction to develop a setting collaboratively.<br/><br/>As play develops, you add entries in one of three book colours. These note the relative authority, scope and mechanical influence of the entry. To act, total applicable entries into a bonus, or use them to scale results to fight a war or win over a crowd. It's a very simple system.<br/><br/>There's a review <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12412.phtml" rel="nofollow">here.</a> I've made corrections to the book since then.<br/><br/>I've provided some support and options <a href="http://mobunited.livejournal.com/1900.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>This game evolved from my reactions to De Profundis, but it isn't a genre game (though there is a fantasy setting included to ease people in). It is most definitely not a story game in the sense of having a limited narrative scope, supporting low-prep play or insisting on and endgame. It does none of those things. It is in fact, a game as a vehicle for story creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105597/#Comment_105597" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T16:49:22+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  4:49PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Codex</i> sounds extremely cool.

There are some good ideas in it but the presentation of the product needs some work.  Additionally, he is also using the system for his own setting, Fifth Hour.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you frequent RPGnet, he uses the name Palaskar.   I will be happy to assist you with any other information about this product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
