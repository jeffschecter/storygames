                    (Topic title written with tongue firmly in cheek!)<br/><br/><b>Me and then Jason:</b><br/><code>[White Wolf] is adept at marketing in ways that have left an indelible imprint in the hobby. Whereas other companies have made products so that they can sell in an existing market, WW regularly makes products to shape their market, especially with an eye to isolating their customers from other brands.<br/><br/>&lt;code&gt;Josh, I'm with you, but can't really articulate the specific choices WW makes to facilitate this. You're closer to publishing and have obviously thought about this - what triggers are they pulling?</code><br/><br/>In old skool WoD stuff, there was the relatively blatant "we are the elite of roleplaying games; everything else is drek" which worked for a few years until it got old and somebody called them on it.<br/><br/>They also had a sort of natural tie-in with the goth crowd, which is already (tends towards being) insular and elitist.  Whether they exploited that or learned from it is a question for the history books.<br/><br/>White Wolf was one of the first publishing houses that started doing their own teeshirts as fashion products -- not as advertisements or something, but OMG so fucking cool black teeshirt that just so happens to advertise White Wolf products.  That a lot of the teeshirts (and other merch) allowed you to declare your factional loyalties (Lasombra are kewl) only accelerated this.  Teeshirts have great penetration value -- they go everywhere your consumer goes -- but this also turned into a membership badge.<br/><br/>Out in the wild, LARPers might run one game and then when that was over switch to another; White Wolf organized the Camarilla to ensure that their LARPers played a never-ending campaign using White Wolf products.  Steady revenue stream by isolating their customers.<br/><br/>Most recently, nearly everything that they release is crippleware -- you would be hard pressed to make a "capable" character out of just the core book of Exalted, for instance, especially if you're at a Con or LARP or competitive home tabletop group where other players are bringing in material from other books.  At the Vampire LARP I was recently at, for instance, somebody was playing some very big and monstrous splat, and another guy tried to stake him, and everybody mocked him because <em>of course</em> you can't stake that splat, the stake just turns to ash!  Haven't you read that book?  It's so embedded that they run ads for the additional books in the first book that doesn't have the complete rule set.<br/><br/>Once you've invested a few hundred dollars into a single game line, you're lots more likely to want to play that line, and more likely to buy even more books because you're going to use them, because that's the game you play -- until you identify with the game line: "I am a Vampire player."  Which also means that you're less likely to buy other books -- why get Riddle of Steel, after all, when you're a Vampire player?<br/><br/>Now, I actually don't really fault WW for most of this -- save the crippleware books, which is great marketing but poor publishing, this is all good business practice.  Disneyland sells annual passes for the same exact reason -- consumers that identify with the brand are a steady revenue stream.                </div>

<p>You did say that this was tongue in cheek, but IMHO there are quite a few things here that are not evil, but in fact very savvy and good moves, and any independent publisher could emulate to good ends.</p>

                            If your business model is predicated on monthly infusions of 128 page hardbacks, crippleware makes a hell of a lot of sense.  Although actually adding value to your customer's experience would make even more sense.<br/><br/>The social/affinity group tie-in is also obvious and very interesting.  I'm way outside the scene - do you see the same thing with, say, anime?  <br/><br/>Can we tiny publishers learn from WW's branding and affinity strategies, or does it not scale down?  I know there are some people thinking about this - Clinton adopting CRN Games as a moniker, for example, to associate his good reputation as a designer directly with his products, so that some dude who might not otherwise pick up his new "Belgian Sex Police" game will give it a look.                        </div>

                            I think there' s probably a few more things going on here.  For example, White Wolf ran long storylines through their game books so that you could get something out of the books <i>without ever playing the damn game</i>.  Some people love that stuff; learning about the fiction and the metaplot and being able to discuss with each other what this and that means. Like the X-Files fan communities of old, WW allowed you to have different theories and read a lot into their plots.                        </div>

This is just sad.<br/>
<br/>
Of COURSE it is good marketing to say "those who buy our products are smarter, better looking, and awesomer than those who buy our competitors".  Watch a week of prime time television commercials (don't watch the shows, they're bad for you) and report back.  Car commercials say it, computer commercials say it, why the hell shouldn't gaming marketing, even if placed in-book, say it?                        </div>

                            Dev -- yeah, most is good business practices.<br/><br/>Christian -- oops, I forgot one, yeah.  And that's actually good publishing -- the books they produced were enjoyable <em>as books</em> in addition to being useful as instruction manuals.<br/><br/>Jason -- I think anime in the US is presently sort of open territory, do-it-yourself collecting of material produced for another market.  While that's changing, there's still a brisk trade in copies-of-copies and suchlike.  Once somebody gets on the scene and starts providing content direct from the producers and/or provides content directed to the US market, things will change very quickly.  This might be Tokyopop, sure, but it could just as easily be NetFlix, if they expanded their anime catalog.<br/><br/>It all scales to some extent, although some portions are only really applicable to mass media.  I doubt any indie designers could, for instance, pump out enough material fast enough to entertain a consumer base on a exclusive basis.  That all but requires an infrastructure of writers, designers, printers, et al, working full-time to keep those 128 page books coming out every four months.  Additionally, it's a lot easier to tie consumers into a game <em>line</em> than it is a succession of unrelated games from the same author-publisher.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think most indiefolk are missing out on lots of potential tie-in merchandise.  I'd totally buy and wear a Roach teeshirt, for instance.  I'm pretty sure PTA decks of cards would move.  Hell, Andy could probably sell Story-Games dice bags.  Just be sure that whatever tie-in stuff you put out there ties into your publishing imprint -- if I've got a Roach shirt, I've probably already got Roach.  Your goal is to make it more likely I buy Grey Ranks.<br/><br/>On another tack very similar to the Camarilla is Thomas' idea on how to package my own game, Agora.  Which, frighteningly enough, I'm receiving emails of interest in building.<br/><br/>And of course, also consider how much of this we are already doing if you consider Indie Games in general.  How many folks would identify themselves as "Indie Gamers"?  How many folks buy whatever indie title is the new hotness?  Perhaps most puissantly, how many folks devoutly believe that their indie game collection is the elite of roleplaying games and everything else is drek?  So we're not untouched by any of this.<br/><br/>JD, did you read the thread, man?                        </div>

<blockquote>Graham, that's why White Wolf borrowed it from Anne Rice, Emma Bull, and others. ;-)</blockquote>
Well, that's a fair point, but everything's been done before. And I think they did it well.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is: one thing White Wolf did well was create a game that, from the setting alone, sounds interesting to play.<br/><br/>As a tangent, have a look at the <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/24hourrpg/" rel="nofollow">24 Hour RPG</a> site and read through some of the descriptions of the games. It's surprising, to me, how <i>few</i> capture my imagination just from that description. Most of the White Wolf games would sound really good if you described them in a paragraph.<br/><br/>(I'm getting the feeling that everything I've said was probably said in 2002 on a Forge thread. Oh well).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>Something White Wolf does damn well: color and setting. Sure, Vampire has been done elsewhere, but something about the splat-ful way they organize their worlds is enticing to a lot of potential gamers, and successful use of color - getting everyone one the same imaginitive page - is an important step in a game. (What I'd really like to do is play the new Mage game some time, but with Sorceror rules.)</p>

                            Actually, Graham, focusing the marketing on setting is something that indie games generally don't do, so I doubt you'll find <em>that</em> much agreement on the old Forge threads.  Mainstream games sell on the basis of their settings (because settings sell supplements).  Indie games generally have a sketchy setting (Dogs), have the players create the setting (PTA), or handwave the setting altogether (Sorcerer).  Fact of the matter is, though, that most gamer customers look first at the setting when making their purchasing decisions.                        </div>

                            Well, White Wolf certainly isn't <em>trying</em> to get more people into gaming in general.  Whether or not people who are brought in via White Wolf proceed onward to other games is a good question, and one that doesn't have a lot of hard data.  Anecdotally, I don't know of anyone, and I've played with lots of WW players.                        </div>

                            I know people who moved from WW to "freeform" chat play.  In fact, that's where I first encountered (and played in) the WW setting.  It's actually a lot more fun for me that way.  But I don't know anyone who moved to other table top games from WW.                        </div>

Now what?<br/>Mages, they're even more stupidly hard. Surely nothing else.<br/>Mummies! Hoorah even more crazily broken mechanics.

Because it's Streetfighter.<br/><br/>And I like WW far more than many gamers I know.<br/>Still Storyteller could be worse, it could be D20.<br/><br/>Right I need to go into my isolation chamber and listen to some pan pipes to calm down now.                        </div>

<p>But in other words, they're creating hardcore brand loyalty and people identifying their favorite game with the qualities they want. And surely, when a potential gamer walks into FLGS/IPR, you don't want them satisfied with just any other game - you want them to ask for the games they associate with your imprint, that they trust. Do you really want people to be like "oh, The Mountain Witch or Polaris? Eh, they're both indie games..." Of course not. You want them to want <em>your</em> game.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if WW is directly tyring to bring people to the hobby in large numbers, but I'd argue that having WW games as a possible first-game has made the hobby more welcoming to a great many people, more so than if D&amp;D was the only gateway game. (Of course, I'd wager there are better gateway games than either, but that's separate.)</p>

                            I agree with the majority of these points. The LARP issues that you describe don't jive with me. The LARP groups I know have never moved on from the game that brings them together. Whether it's Changeling or Mystic Realms, those people are lifers (character lifers.)<br/>
<br/>
The Camarilla seemed a good idea to me. Maybe the LARPers I know are already isolationist, but putting together a nationwide support system for their LARP seems a good move. Not just in a business way either. I know a few people who used it to expand their LARP exposure when they moved to a new state.                        </div>

                            Gains -- yeah, it's a good idea.  So when somebody moves to a new state, for instance, they don't have to go find any local LARP, they can be assured to find a local LARP that's running World of Darkness, and keep buying WoD books. ;-)                        </div>

<i>Everway, as I recall, was an attempt to create a new gateway game, a gateway from the New Age community (specifically tarot) into RPG's.</i><br/><br/>Actually, it was right on the heels of the burgeoning MtG craze, and it looks like their aim was to tie in CCGs (because the vision cards were collectible) and an RPG.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as that John Tynes "Minotaur" article summed up best a few years back, "Every copy of the game wasn't packaged with a miniature Jonathan Tweet to run it for you. I read the game again the other day, and I waffle between "marvelous" and "criticaly 'Calvinball' flawed". <br/><br/>You can get copies of Everway still in shrinkwrap (after 11+ years), plus a case of Vision Cards, for like $20 on eBay these days. Their collossal failure is kinda humbling.                        </div>

                            Boy, Everway...I stumbled upon it a while back in a warehouse sale and have always had a perverse fascination with taking it out, flipping through the box (cards, books, and all), think about trying to run it, then putting it right back on the shelf.  It's such a visually stimulating design...                        </div>

I think it's an idea with merit. And one that an indie could take advantage of with a message board, emailed newsletters and something like FindPlay.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to support your consumer base so that they're pleased with your product. If they're so pleased they never look elsewhere . . . well, there are apparently still people playing EQ in the age of  WoW.                        </div>

What is stopping someone from bringing these things together, and starting a site whose purpose is to serve the Indie RPG players in the way we're describing?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the pieces are there, all it takes is someone with the skills and time to make it happen.                        </div>

I could give you a list as long as my arm of problems with it in community construction, but I think a centralized location would be a pretty cool thing to have for roleplaying...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            I agree with Andy about Everway. The concept and foundations sound cool, but are just too squishy for "Joe GMs" like me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I am currently selling my copy of Everway on eBay starting at just $1! :-)  The auction also includes 1400+ Vision cards, composed of 16 copies of the Everway expansion deck.  These extra Vision card might be useful fodder for someone looking to design their own card-based RPG.<br/>

I apologize if this eBay link is inappropriate. I just thought it might of interest, since people were discussing where to buy Everway.                        </div>

<blockquote>Well, White Wolf certainly isn't trying to get more people into gaming in general. Whether or not people who are brought in via White Wolf proceed onward to other games is a good question, and one that doesn't have a lot of hard data. Anecdotally, I don't know of anyone, and I've played with lots of WW players.</blockquote>
Well, it's only anecdotal, but I feel my experience with this is rather relevant, so I thought I'd share, briefly<br/><br/>I was someone who was introduced to RPGs through WW and moved onto other games, first D&amp;D and then Indie titles. It was not an easy transition either. I was introduced to WW at the tender age of 13 and bought heavily into the "this game is the elite RPG; everything else is drek" mantra. When a friend introduced me to D&amp;D I whined and complained, kicked and screamed the whole time. I pointed out what a 'superior' system WW was and how we should be playing that instead. Then 3.0 came out and, after some initial distrust I finally got into it and started to move past my WW-sown pretentiousness. Then, once GenCon moved to my hometown, I met Indie RPGs. Same initial reaction as my first exposure to D&amp;D, but I bought a couple titles. Read them over the next year, played some, and realized they were the only purchases I was actually happy with. <br/><br/>Oh, and I have played non-WW games with people who would normally identify themselves as WW players. It's interesting as they have pretty much the same reaction to other games as I did back when I was 13, dismissing all other games as drek, most of which they haven't even played.                        </div>

                            I still have my two copies of Everway, binders full of art cards (including the vision cards), stacks of duplicate art cards, and even an unused demo package...<br/>
<br/>
I'm waiting for someone else to come out with a game that uses the idea of art cards, but with a more playable game...<br/>

                            Kat Miller is working on one. I was in an early playtest, and the driving principle is to avoid having all of the interesting stuff implied by the art cards take place before the game play begins like it does in Everway.                        </div>
