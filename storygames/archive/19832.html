(It might be more accurate to say that portions of the book feel like Fantasy Comedy-of-Manners, though the overall story takes a different turn.)<br/><br/>I'm interested in running a very rules-light game. It should facilitate a comedy of manners story in traditional (Aristocrats in Regency England) or unconventional (immigrant communities of 1899 New York) settings with some fantastical elements. Probably only looking at a handful of sessions, so I don't need strong support for long term play.<br/><br/>Can anyone suggest a good system for a game like that, or would anyone care critique the current frontrunner, which is to modify John Harper's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lasers and Feelings</span>? The mechanic would either be renamed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sense and Sensibility</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practicality and Passion</span> or similar.<br/><br/>Why I think I want to tackle this by converting Lasers and Feelings: I noticed that in many comedies of manners, there is a great deal of attention paid to the tension between the passion and sense, ambition and practicality, creativity and reliability, proscribed behaviors and transgression. Also, that it\u2019s not so much a war between the two as it is an interaction between opposed but complementary themes. And that many of moments of success rely on finding a way to accommodate both sides of this yin/yang dynamic.<br/><br/>In the one game of Lasers and Feelings I ran, I noticed that it did a great job of keeping the central thematic elements, the yin and yang of rationality and emotion and the dynamic tension the generate, at the forefront of the story. I thought it might be applicable to games where one want to emphasize that same tension, as seen from a different perspective.<br/><br/>I'm considering adding Keys from Lady Blackbird and perhaps a very small pool of bonus dice. Perhaps two of the former and three of the latter, to start. The bonus die pool wouldn't refill from refresh scenes, only from hitting or abandoning your keys.<br/><br/>I'll have to re-flavor \u201ccharacter creation,\u201d \u201ccreate an adventure,\u201d and \u201crun the game\u201d, but the central mechanic should work, I think.<br/><br/>Ok folks, rip me apart. Where am I going wrong, IYHO? Right idea, wrong modifications, or is there already a better system out there? I'll mention that, as far as I understand, both Cortex Plus Drama and Drama System are substantially more rules-heavy than what I have in mind.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439727/#Comment_439727" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-27T20:49:14+00:00" title="October 27, 2014  8:49PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...actually, I think you might just be spot-on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439728/#Comment_439728" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-27T21:00:21+00:00" title="October 27, 2014  9:00PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2014 9:00PM by AsIf.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you've hit on something, both in your observation of a thematic polarity within the COM structure and on the applicability of the basic L&amp;F system to the bipolar arrangement of not only "weapons vs emotions" but entire social groups, classes or core philosophies.

Or would <i>Shock</i>-like rounds of intertwined but individual stories, protagonist vs. antagonist, get closer? Or do we need something slightly less structured, the kind of play you can get out of a <i>Sorcerer</i> or <i>TSoY</i>-like setup with a "bass playing" GM, maybe with individual character Kickers and "story bullseye" diagrams?<br/><br/>The GM/character players split of most role-playing games, with an at least partly GM-driven plot, tends to work best for stories where the tension is between a somewhat fixed cast of main characters and somewhat changeable, ultimately disposable external forces: stories such as ensemble-cast action adventures, expeditions toward the unknown or police procedurals. Though exceptions abound, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain" title="exploding_brain"><img alt="exploding_brain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain">exploding_brain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439753/#Comment_439753" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-28T21:05:48+00:00" title="October 28, 2014  9:05PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the votes of confidence. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As to Rafu's analysis (for which I'm grateful, as it contains good ideas and is helping me clarify my thoughts):<br/><br/>The dramatic structure that I think I want is the one that I usually see come out of "Powered by the Apocalypse" games. PCs have relationships to things in the game world, there are things they want to accomplish, they take actions to do so, and the world reacts to them. They often interact with each other, but also have plenty of solo scenes. The GM plays the world and the NPCs.<br/><br/>Lasers and feelings has the following options for resolving "risky" actions: <br/>- It goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse somehow.<br/>- You barely manage it. The GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost.<br/>- You do it well. Good job!<br/>- You get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get.<br/>- You have laser feelings. You get a special insight into what\u2019s going on. Ask the GM a question and they\u2019ll answer you honestly.<br/><br/>So that's sort of a very light version of PbtA's outcomes, plus the Read a Situation Move.<br/><br/>My most successfully GMed games have been (IMHO) Monster of the Week, Monsterhearts and the one game of Lasers and Feelings I ran, which felt like running Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>I expect NPCs to be less disposable than described as typical for GM/character games. I agree that this is a common pattern, and possibly the one leads to the other, but I expect this will be one of the exceptions. I've played in a several games with that division of responsibilities, in which there was a recurring cast of "Friendly" NPCs who provided challenges in the form of complicated social relationship requiring management and negotiation, rather than obstacles to be overcome in a short time. Or rather, the NPCs were a mix of temporary and ongoing sources of opposition and story complication. In any event, I have reason to believe a GM/character split will work at least adequately well.<br/><br/>Fiasco's system of setting up relationships and needs and MacGuffins isn't far off from what I have in mind, but otherwise it's not the narrative structure, or game length, that I'm looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439770/#Comment_439770" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-29T15:02:08+00:00" title="October 29, 2014  3:02PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2014 5:04PM by Aviatrix.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I've been around from the ground floor on the discussion of this game and I'm trying to work through my thoughts about it. I must confess to a general block here because I'm an English Major Geek and my hackles rise--in an undeserved fashion--at the thought of reducing Lizzie Bennett, one of the most fully realized, humane, and captivating characters in English literature, to a single stat of opposed poles. But that's me; it's not going to advance the conversation. Instead, let me confine my remarks to some general observations about the nature of "Comedy of Manners" and the specific obstacles that should be considered in creating a game around it.<br/><br/>(1) What exactly do you mean by "Comedy of Manners"? The term is broad and can conceivably envelop the comedies of Terence, <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> and other Shakespeare comedies (possibly <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, but not <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> and <i>All's Well That Ends Well</i>), most of Moliere, the Restoration comedies of Goldsmith and Sheridan, Austen of course, but also Wilde, Coward, and Wodehouse.<br/><br/>This is somewhat important to consider, because if people come in with different models you're going to have a jarring experience.<br/><br/>(2) How does the fantasy element interact with this? Are we talking Elven courts, Alt-Italy intrigues among the great merchant houses, or English estates with gnomes? Again this is mostly an issue of shaping expectations--if one person comes in expecting "Frozen", another the Winter Court from the Dresden Files, and a third Lizzie Bennett as an elf, there's issues.<br/><br/>On a side note--because it can and should impact the fantasy bits--a Comedy of Manners is inextricably caught up in matters of class. (And for Austen, the Woman Question as most of her novels are about the need of women to secure enough money to live on.) You can remove issues of class, but it's like cutting the strings on a marionette--it will still be pretty, but it won't dance.<br/><br/>(3) On rules issues: how is the comedy going to play out? Are PCs expected to pair up with NPCs? Is this going to be one of the "central couple needs to be united" stories with the other PCs providing support/opposition? How often are PCs expected to oppose each other? My own estimation is that PvP is going to be a major component of a game like this and needs to be planned for. (Apocalypse World is fruitful reading here, as it also assumes PvP.)<br/><br/>(4) What exactly is the Number expected to test? What questions will it answer? What kinds of obstacles does it overcome? Do you roll it to stand up to Lady De Brough when she tells you Darcy must marry her daughter? Or is that handled by table talk?<br/><br/>(5) I think Lasers &amp; Feelings rather awesomely captures the madcap and rather loosely plotted nature of a Certain Classic Sci Fi show, where plot holes and sudden reversals could be swept under the rug of Awesome Concept and cast chemistry. I'm not as sanguine that it can capture the more subtle nature of the internalized conflicts of the source material--especially Austen. There's also the need for really tight story structure, generally, in this genre (in addition to being one of the English language's great prose stylists and wickedly funny, Austen was brilliant at structure; <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is so taut Ginger Baker could do a twenty minute drum solo on it.) Again, * World games are helpful models here, as they lend themselves to consequential structuring.<br/><br/>Part of me wonders what John Harper's minigame for Austenesque stories would look like, but part of me says he already wrote it and it's called <i>Lady Blackbird</i>.<br/><br/>I think in the end a lot is going to come down to the kind of game and most especially the tone you're shooting for. If it's a light-hearted fantasy romp of marriage and intrigue, I think you're pretty spot on. I don't think the system is complex enough to do real justice to Austen; for one thing, I don't think her more developed characters work along a scale of opposed values. (Certainly true of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>; if nothing else, this thread convinced me to start reading <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, and you may be on more solid ground there.) If you tried to do Tolstoy with it I'd probably have to hunt you down ;-)<br/><br/>Finally, after all this bloviation it behooves me to make my own recommendations. Keep in mind that my English Geekery is going to push me towards the serious end of things:<br/><br/>For full-blown Austenesque stories: Cortex Plus Drama, which may end up my go-to system for almost everything. (That's part of what the <i>Midnight's Voice</i> experiment is about.)<br/><br/>More nuanced but simpler than C+ Drama: a hack of <i>Lady Blackbird</i>. All the elements are there, it's just a matter of coming up with the right elements.<br/><br/>There's probably a World hack in here <i>somewhere</i>, but differentiation of the niches may result in less playable characters.<br/><br/>Fiasco <i>could</i> work, with the Soft Tilt from the Companion. It has the enormous advantage of allowing the setting of tone via the playset choices.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain" title="exploding_brain"><img alt="exploding_brain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain">exploding_brain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439776/#Comment_439776" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-29T18:52:48+00:00" title="October 29, 2014  6:52PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last bits first: I'm not familiar with the Soft Tilt variant, but a Fiasco like setup that plays more like more of a romantic light farce than a Coen Brothers comi tragic dark farce isn't a bad idea. That might be what I'd use for a one shot.<br/><br/>I might do a pros, cons and question list for Fiasco, C+ Drama and Lady B in a later post, but first I'd rather respond to the stuff about the genre.<br/><br/>I'll start with talking about the primary source text.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Golem and The Jinni</span>. 1899, New York City, dozens of classes and communities and cultures and languages and religions all piled next to and on top of each other. The story concentrates on two immigrant communities at the southern end of Manhattan, and while the interactions across communities and classes is infrequent, it's a significant part of the story.<br/><br/>The appearance of supernatural is rare, and invariably kept secret from the populace at large, but the story revolves around supernatural characters and events and the small number of mortals who interact with them. Not like the Dresden files where the supernatural is hidden but common enough to have a significant influence on the world at large. The supernatural is primarily a metaphor to heighten thematics, and to introduce complications and be a disruptive influence.<br/><br/>Despite the wide variety of cultures, preoccupations with propriety is ubiquitous, as is the need to earn enough money to keep body and soul together. Actually becoming financially successful in the New World is a minor theme, but present.<br/><br/>Other themes include:<br/>How one fits into one's community (being the newcomer, the  pillar of the community, the outcast/charity case, etc)<br/>The old ways vs the new ways<br/>Schisms in the community<br/>Interacting with people outside your own community vs staying within it<br/>Conflict and cooperation across class lines<br/>How class lines run between communities, and through them<br/>Bigotry and tolerance (this is a smaller issue than it might be)<br/>Ambition vs prudence<br/>Making a good love/marriage match (including versions of "The Woman Question")<br/>Freedom vs interdependence<br/>Artistic expression vs diligent productivity<br/>Falling prey to sin and temptation vs never living your life<br/>Relationships with the city itself<br/>And secrets, lots and lots of secrets<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Civil Campaign</span> by Bujold probably makes a good secondary source text, though I'd rather focus on the middle and lower middle classes than the affairs of the High Vor. Bujold's take on the influence of scientific innovations in that particular book is a reasonable facsimile of the effects of magic that I have in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain" title="exploding_brain"><img alt="exploding_brain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain">exploding_brain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439778/#Comment_439778" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-29T18:58:15+00:00" title="October 29, 2014  6:58PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2014 6:59PM by exploding_brain.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side note, I'm starting to picture this as a Monsterhearts game, though the horror elements are significantly reduced (more of a fairy tale/Midsummer Night's Dream feel?).

The setting of her novels reflects her (somewhat provincial) experience, but materially functions only as a) somewhat of a limit on the number of eligible men for her unmarried ladies and b) in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> as a convenient way to show Darcy's snobbishness at society outside of London.

This is either a feature or a bug, depending on your goals; it's guaranteed to create a well-detailed world with a lot of good conflicts built in. For example, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19800/midnight-s-voice-a-whitechapel-drama-cortex" rel="nofollow">my own C+ Drama project</a> had really no set up other than what the players did on the relationship map (plus my own knowledge of the Autumn of Terror), but we've had some nice dramatic conflicts from the start.<br/><br/>Mechanically, Cortex Plus is about where Fate is. The main issue is Distinctions, which have bennies &amp; drawbacks associated with them that are worked out in advance--usually.<br/><br/>You can simplify Distinctions somewhat by using the Action methodology of "d8 if it helps/d4 &amp; plot point if it hurts". You could also create the bennies on the fly based on play, or do it with rulings, although at that point you're drifting from the rules as designed.\n<blockquote><br/>World games have a pretty strong focus on resolving stuff through violence, which is something I'd like to de-emphasize.

Some (the Read People/Situations) could port in relatively easily. There may be a neat rebuild of Go Aggro that reflects attempts to cause social harm:<br/><br/>When you use <b>Social Aggression</b> on someone, roll +Reputation. On a 10\u201311, they have to choose: Challenge your honor, or loose face publicly. On a 7\u20139, they have to choose 1:<br/><br/>\u2022 Avoid you socially at future events<br/>\u2022 Refuse to go out in society for a fortnight<br/>\u2022 Offer you an item or service they believe you want<br/>\u2022 Appeal to the host or hostess<br/>\u2022 Offer you an (apparently sincere) Compliment<br/>\u2022 Challenge your honor<br/><br/><b>Challenging Your Honor</b>: for a woman using social aggression on a woman, this usually involves making a scene: an embarrassing public argument. If both a man and a woman are involved in the Social Aggression, the Challenge takes the form of snubs, sly intimations, and the spreading of rumors to people who are esteemed by the Aggressor. For Aggression between two men, the Challenge will either be as a mixed gender interaction (above), or take the form of a challenge to a duel.<br/><br/>The reason I note both C+Drama &amp; *World games above is that they have very good structural tools--World games make events into a chain of <i>consequences</i>, while C+Drama has an engine that creates the Scene/Sequel chain Jim Butcher has talked about--that is, a thwarted attempt to do something, followed by a scene of reflection &amp; redirection (the Stress Relief mechanic.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439813/#Comment_439813" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-30T17:05:57+00:00" title="October 30, 2014  5:05PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure how "violence" was meant, but Cortex Plus <i>does</i> involve characters pressuring other characters to go along with them by dealing out physical or emotional stress.

One issue there is that MH has four stats, one of which is Volatile, which is used to Run Away, or Lash Out Physically. To me, that looks like a pretty strong signal to the players that violence is an option. Most of the other *World games have violent moves like Size by Force or Go Aggro, and stats tied to that move, which gives a similar signal.<br/><br/>So if I did use a *World model, I'd be tempted to rewrite the stats and the moves and the splats. That may be more work than I'm prepared for.<br/><br/>C+ Drama does sound like a good candidate overall. I suppose it depends on how ambitious the campaign becomes. That will determine if the relationship mapping work is likely to be worth the effort.<br/><br/>Regarding structure, my limited experience indicates that the L&amp;F mechanic does about as well at consequential structuring as *World. It would be clever of me to write up an equivalent to threats or fronts to help generate consequences (hard and soft moves), but that's not a player facing issue. The scene/Sequel structure of C+ Drama sounds interesting. Also sounds a bit like Lady Blackbird. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain" title="exploding_brain"><img alt="exploding_brain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/exploding_brain">exploding_brain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439816/#Comment_439816" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-30T17:41:43+00:00" title="October 30, 2014  5:41PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2014 5:42PM by exploding_brain.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like there's a decision between facilitating good narrative structure, and empowering characters to poke at the world and see what happens.

World games and C+ Drama have some of the better tools I've encountered to get that cycle up and running. <br/><br/>But "narrative structure in gaming" is a bit of my own hobbyhorse currently and probably isn't germane to the discussion.<br/><br/>I'll reiterate: if you want something more rompy &amp; lighthearted, you're dead on about using a L&amp;F hack. This wouldn't be my approach to a Comedy of Manners, but then again I'm going to fully acknowledge that my English geekery is the cause of that attitude; CoM's are some of the most sophisticated forms of writing in English, so I'd want something capable of handling that level of sophistication <i>because that's what interests me in them</i>. But I ain't you &amp; I ain't running this :-) <br/><br/>(My vague ambitions to do something Tolstoyesque during the winter notwithstanding.)<br/><br/>I'm also probably getting somewhat thrown by the use of the term Comedy of Manners which gets into the jargon I got (somewhat to my own astonishment) trained to use professionally. Sometimes that comes out at inopportune moments.<br/><br/>The happy compromise here would be a Lady Blackbird hack: it does just about everything L&amp;F does, with more sophistication. Of course, it lacks the central tension that you're interested in; which is another argument to go with your original choice.<br/><br/>I'll note in passing that the high initial investment in Cortex Plus Drama does keep me from using it more. (I have vague ideas about building a streamlined version of setup that I may even write down one day.) The same goes for a World hack: there's a lot of upfront work to get the playbooks setup, and it probably requires playtesting.

But, the one 4 hour convention Smallville game (really Cortex+ Drama, but that didn't exist as such then) we played had pregens, which I think was the right call.<br/><br/>For a home campaign, I fully expect that the first session will usually be "just" character creation, so I'm fine with taking time, getting everyone on the same page, getting buy in, doing a bit of world building, and so on.<br/><br/>Comedy of Manners could go any way -- the long, loving build up of relationships, an hour or so of building quickly-but-solidly, pre-generated characters, and so on.
