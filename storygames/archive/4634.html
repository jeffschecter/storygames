Now I don't mean in physical sales, from what I hear they were very good. I mean how successful it has been in getting feedback for the designers of the ashcans. I have several related questions so I will list them:<br/><br/>1) How well has the front done in getting feedback for designers, and I mean ALL designers, who took part? I see on the site Acts of Evil, Giants and Psi Run are getting a lot of feedback but I can't see many others on there. I seem to remeber a good number of games on the ashcan front but I am not sure of percentages.<br/><br/>2) This goes to all deisgners who designed an ashcan. Since releasing your ashcan have you had second thoughts, beacuase of feedback or otherwise, about releasing the full version? I ask this as the games that were meant to go to ashcan were supposed to be around 90% complete and have had some playtesting before they hit public release. I have a concern that people may be rushing games out without even playtesting them themselves. <br/><br/>Paul and Matt what percentage of games that were on the ashcan front do you hope to see in a full version?<br/><br/>3) Quality I have found is an interesting one. I have now seen some of the 'ashcans' and in particular 44, matt's game. Now I believe the idea was for: <br/><br/>'The book as an object has a hand assembled or copy shop aesthetic and is clearly not "store ready".' <br/><br/>44 is a beautiful looking thing and has obviously been professionaly printed and looks like it is store ready. Galactic is another one I have seen and I would say it sits on the border of shop ready and the 'copy shop aesthetic' mentioned above. I realise that enforcing an aesthetic would be very hard for you, but it seems odd that Matt went for such a layout when he is one of the founders. Do you think it made others feel 'bad' about the quality of their own ashcans? Do you think releasing such a professional looking book as an ashcan will harm the final product, or even cause dissapointment when it releases?<br/><br/>4) This next one needs a little explanation first. I have a concern that some designers will release games well before they are ready, before they reach that sort of 90% playtested stage of things, using the aschan front to make a quick buck as it were. The reason I have this concern is I have seen similar things happen in computer game s recently where designer would release games that aren't ready and then use microtransactions to patch them later, or just patch them later. Now I would hope that no one would do this but I think it remains a legitimate concern, and I worry that releasing an ashcan might be the final step for some people.<br/><br/>This is slightly different from question 2, which addresses my concern with people releasing before they are anywhere near ready. This is more about people using the front to make money and then not carrying through on the promises that involvement implies.<br/><br/>Do people think this is a legitimate concern?<br/><br/>Thats it for now. I obviously have misgivings about the ashcan front as I worry that designers will become detached from their designs, not engaging fully in the playtesting process, or release products that aren't even ready for the ashcan front.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104710/#Comment_104710" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T04:17:27+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  4:17AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) For the reason you mentioned (few getting quite a bit of feedback, others very little), I'd not call it that great a success except for those that got the feedback. I'd really have preferred that Story-Games or another website decide to host the ashcan's review next time. Gives more people a chance to stumble across it, rather than a specific website they have to hunt for. <br/><br/>2) can't answer<br/><br/>3) I think more ashcans should, in general, focus on clarity of writing and getting the rules nailed down. Reserve the art until later, perhaps soliciting fan feedback for art style. <br/><br/>4) I have similar concerns about this. I think the designers risk getting ahead of themselves without realizing it. While there is some validity to the hypothesis that if playtesters have to pay for the privilege of playtesting they'll take it more seriously, I don't know how much more seriousness the designers are getting, and if it's worth potentially offending/scaring away those people who would be interested, but balk at paying money for a game they know up front isn't complete.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104711/#Comment_104711" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T04:21:16+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  4:21AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Carl, what's your relation to the Ashcan thing?

It's hard to run right home from Gen Con and start playing. Acts of Evil, for example, is on the to-play list of a group I'm in, and we just haven't got it into the rotation yet.<br/><br/>As far as presentation, it was easier for me to put together a book based closely on a final layout than one that looked like an indie comic. What I eventually release will be a different trim size, perfect bound, but you know, I had all that art already, and I'd invested in that cool fond for the headers. Might as well use it.<br/><br/>Games being released too soon, even in ashcan... well, the idea of making a quick buck at Gen Con via ashcan is absurd. I'll say that to let anyone know who was actually considering it. The cost-per-unit for an ashcan just isn't viable as a money maker at a show like that. <br/><br/>The other issue is that determining what's 90% is pretty hard. It's awfully arbitrary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104789/#Comment_104789" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T08:53:30+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  8:53AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, i sold copies of Sweet Agatha: Preview Edition at the ashcan front. Here's my answers/opinions in regards to the questions above:<br/><br/>1. I haven't received much feedback at all since gencon. I got some very good discussion with folks AT the con, but very little afterwards. I'm not sure why exactly. The game is super easy to play, and from start to finish only takes about 45 min, and only 2 people. I figured there would be a lot of early play. Maybe its the back of peoples cue, or they are waiting for the final edition. Hard to say, really. I probably should have sold and supported the game a bit more on the front, but i was kind of in a haze all gencon, and didn't really hit on all cylinders, i could have been a better author, for sure. I have a free game coupon offer in the back of the book, you send it to me and you'll get the full game for free (shipping included) when it's done (round early december, late november). I have, to date, only received one coupon back.<br/><br/>2. I pushed back my release date for Sweet Agatha 2 months, based a lot on what i saw at gencon. I wanted a really appealing package, and putting stuff under the microscope after hearing people's thoughts really helped. <br/><br/>3. I went for a VERY copy shop aesthetic. But that's kind of my style anyway, and it suited the material (all xeroxed, stapled together, a spray paint stencil on the cover). That's what i WANTED, regardless of what Paul and Matt suggested for the shelf (it was nice that it meshed though). I was a little surprised by the production values of 44 and acts of evil (both very VERY cool looking books, but neither were really "copy shop"). When i think copyshop i think ugly san fran zines from the 90's. Maybe if zine culture continued as strong into this decade we would see production values more akin to 44 and Acts, but who knows. It was awesome to see books that looked THAT good. but maybe it did a disservice. I purchased Acts because it was such an awesome art object, I have a lot of interest in the game, but unless Paul takes more than a year to get a finished version out the door, i probably won't be very helpful as a playtester (sorry paul). When the game does come out, i doubt it's going to look better than this hand embossed copy i have on my shelf. I'll probably just get the PDF so i can play with the finished rules. I got my artifact.<br/><br/>I also have a lot of interest in 44. It looks really cool and i think i'll have a lot of fun with it. I didn't get the ashcan. I figured that waiting for the final rules would be a good idea (again, i probably won't time out a playtest), and i know the final version is going to look at least that good. What the ashcan DID do for me... well, now when the game comes out, i'm going to buy it sight unseen. I'm comfortable knowing it's going to be well laid out and look good. No need to concern myself with that. <br/><br/>I felt Jeff's "kingdom of nothing" really hit the mark for copyshop aesthetic. Glossy cardstock cover, saddle stiched xerox paper. You can leave the book open (the cover is too thick) and you can keep the book exactly shut (there's too many pages stapled together). These are the kind of layout concerns that don't matter for an ashcan but can't be ignored in a final version. The cover was exciting enough that it drew the eye, and the guts were simple enough that you got the message on how to play, but you knew there was work to be done. <br/><br/>4. If you're a new designer and you think that releasing an ashcan is going to give a little boost of capitol before your real release you don't understand the economy of production, or you're ripping off your customers and you would probably steel sheep from starving peasants. Ashcan's don't make money, they cost money. I don't know if people will now rush to produce ashcans. Maybe they will. I think if that's the case, we're better off buying quarter baked games sold to us as ashcans than half baked games sold to us as final products. If i got an ashcan and it wasn't really much of a game, i probably wouldn't feel ripped off, and to be honest i would be more likely to give feedback ("ugh, you don't really explain how anything works, maybe you should be more clear on that.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/michael-cloud" title="michael-cloud"><img alt="michael-cloud" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/michael-cloud">michael-cloud</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104794/#Comment_104794" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T09:00:38+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  9:00AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: ihmcallisterDown at Furnace I was talking with various people about ashcan front and pondering how succesful it had been.

(By bare bones, I mean all the examples and rules are nailed down, but there's no art to speak of.)<br/><br/>I am not impugning anyone's motives here. I am simply wondering if it's a successful format. I recall at least one person mentioning they were less-than-thrilled with the idea of ashcans. If that one person is an aberration, fine.

I'm happy to hear suggestions; so is Paul. <br/><br/>That said, I consider it a pretty remarkable success to date. This is not to say it was a home run for everyone who stepped on the black &amp; red checkered floor, nor it is to say that from this date onward all publishers will necessarily succeed.<br/><br/>On to Iain's questions: <br/>\n<blockquote>1) How well has the front done in getting feedback for designers, and I mean ALL designers, who took part? I see on the site Acts of Evil, Giants and Psi Run are getting a lot of feedback but I can't see many others on there. I seem to remeber a good number of games on the ashcan front but I am not sure of percentages.</blockquote>\nIt's done ok. I think there are probably a couple games that aren't getting much feedback. I'm not getting much, for one. A little, but not much. However, I didn't really expect any for at least six months, honestly. I figured it'd take at least that long for someone to play and then respond with useful information.<br/><br/>So, I'm not concerned about lack of feedback just yet. But, it's certainly possible that some games will fail to receieve anything substantial and useful. I'd consider that a failure for that game and that person / publisher.<br/>\n<blockquote>2) This goes to all deisgners who designed an ashcan. Since releasing your ashcan have you had second thoughts, beacuase of feedback or otherwise, about releasing the full version? I ask this as the games that were meant to go to ashcan were supposed to be around 90% complete and have had some playtesting before they hit public release. I have a concern that people may be rushing games out without even playtesting them themselves. </blockquote>\nNope, not here. Others can chime in. I'm not aware of anyone in that situation.\n<blockquote>Paul and Matt what percentage of games that were on the ashcan front do you hope to see in a full version?</blockquote>\nThat one's easy! I <i>hope</i> to see 100% of course. Paul and I have done our part, and will likely do more, to help people along. But, ultimately, we both realize that it's the personal responsibility of the publisher himself (unfortunately, we had no 'herselfs'). So, in all honesty, I do no <i>expect</i> the 100% will happen. I'd be thrilled if it did. I do expect that, say, 80%-90% of the games will be published in fuller form later.\n<blockquote>3) Quality I have found is an interesting one. I have now seen some of the 'ashcans' and in particular 44, matt's game. (SNIP) I realise that enforcing an aesthetic would be very hard for you, but it seems odd that Matt went for such a layout when he is one of the founders. Do you think it made others feel 'bad' about the quality of their own ashcans? Do you think releasing such a professional looking book as an ashcan will harm the final product, or even cause dissapointment when it releases?</blockquote>\nNo.<br/><br/>Having one's feet held to the fire for being "too pretty" isn't exactly a problem. It is not one of my concerns, neither as offending other colleagues (I sensed no concerns, and sensed lots of other appreciation) nor inviting disappointment later.<br/><br/>I think my book design is good, not great. It's attractive. It also demonstrates the diversity of acceptable formats for ashcans. That Iain (and others, maybe?) is suggesting it might not be acceptable is ... strange.<br/><br/>I just have to shrug and suggest you to reconsider your personal definition of what the physical format of an ashcan. And, accept -- as I said repeatedly online and in podcasts since May or so -- that ashcan is more about process and design stage than it is about whether or not your game is wrapped up in a brown paper sack.<br/><br/>I have other concerns, like people talking about how 44 <i>looks</i> more than how it plays or how it might be improved. Read it, play it, and let me know how it goes!\n<blockquote>4) This next one needs a little explanation first. I have a concern that some designers will release games well before they are ready, before they reach that sort of 90% playtested stage of things, using the aschan front to make a quick buck as it were. </blockquote>\nThis concern was raised about the Ashcan Front in particular elsewhere. I have to look at it with a seriously jaded eye. People paid at least $160 (for booth entry and badge, some paid $180) plus expenses (food, travel, and hotel, which far, far exceed $180) to be able to sell their $10 or $15 game to roughly 20-40 people. Paul and I threw down considerably more than that, but did recoup some of our costs.<br/><br/>As you can see, the math is not in favor of making a quick buck. It is a losing proposition, likely. Consider it a cost of performing a unique kind of research.<br/><br/>Could other designers outside the Ashcan Front (or "after" the AF) create ashcan games with an eye toward making a fast buck, perhaps online? Sure, I guess. <br/><br/>But, that ignores the cause that started the Ashcan Front in the first place. I believed the phrase getting tossed around was "half-baked" games and another phrase was "stealing money from your wallet."<br/><br/>I'm much more concerned about the <i>lack</i> of ashcans than I am concerned about hypothetical ashcan charlatanism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104876/#Comment_104876" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T13:14:14+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  1:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite><br/>But, that ignores the cause that started the Ashcan Front in the first place.

I considered joining up with the Ashcan Front for <i>Dirty Secrets</i>; indeed, Paul approached me about it at Forge Midwest.  Ultimately I decided against it; however, there's a First Edition notice in the front of the game book.  If you provide substantial feedback that improves the game for a Revised Edition, you get your copy of that Revised Edition at a substantive discount.  I feel confident that my game is well-baked, but I decided to interact with my audience in this way because of the existence of the Ashcan Front.  Moreover, the very existence of the Ashcan Front forced me to evaluate how "done" my game was.  I think that this is another useful service to the game community at large.<br/><br/>Penny 2:  this is my "game player" penny.  Had the Ashcan Front not existed, I would not have really engaged with A Penny For My Thoughts.  (Of course, it also took Emily Care's endorsement to send me over to demo it, but that's a different thread.)  As a result of the exposure given to APFMT from the Ashcan Front, I have since played a playtest game of it (one of those two recordings mentioned), gotten involved with an email playtest, and have generally enthused about the game in various people's direction.  I've also been interested in 44, and my group will probably get around to giving that a whirl.  (I also roomed with Matt Snyder at GenCon, which gave us the chance to discuss 44 a bit.)  Without the presence of the booth, these games probably would not have risen to the level of my attention.<br/><br/>So, testimonial from me.  From where I sit, the booth seems to have helped reverse the concern that Matt notes in the above quote.  So that's a good thing in my book.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104892/#Comment_104892" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T16:08:16+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  4:08PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some interesting posts here, and a general positive feel for the ashcan front which I can only take to be a good thing.<br/><br/> I will reply to individual things that interested me below and by name or subject to clarify what I was meaning<br/><br/><b>The fast-buck problem:</b> I can totally understand people thinking this is a ludicrous idea for something like Gencon where the expense is high to get in. I was more thinking of the ashcan catching on in other places and smaller cons. For instance, throwing some figures around at random here, if I go to Conpulsion, in my home town, and take 10 ashcans of 'Stitch' say and sell them for \xc2\xa35-6 a pop, I will make a profit of at least \xc2\xa33 on each giving me \xc2\xa330 in pocket. Nothing major but profit nonetheless. I am not saying you could make a living of it, I just worry about unscrupulous deisgners making a crappy game, ashcanning it and  using the profits to fund their beer money for the weekend rather than embracing the good intentions of the 'ashcan movement'. Hope that isn't too strong a turn of phrase.<br/><b><br/>Matt Snyder:</b> Unacceptable is a strong word, more inappropriate was what i meant, reading from the material you and Paul put on the website. Your parameters, for want of a better word, was that it should have a copy shop aesthetic to it, which 44 obviously does not. I would say it was one of the better books for actually promoting debate about the game because of the side bars you added, I just felt that as one of the founders of the front, you should have adhered to the guidance you laid down. I have not seen 'Acts of Evil' so am in no position to comment on it.<br/><br/>As to those guidelines I have a follow up question Matt. Matt Wilson pointed out, quite rightly, that the 90% thing is quite an arbitary kind of mark. What guidlines did you give to designers as to how playtested their games should be before they get ashcanned? To me it would seem right to have playtested it 4 or 5 times at least and gone through a few different versions of the rules, clarifying things each time until you are ready to release a public playtest version, which is basically what an ashcan is.<br/><br/>As to success, I was wondering if you might be able to tell me how many games were on the ashcan front table. That would help me better judge the level of feedback being given. Any info. you can give in this regard would be appreciated.<br/><br/><b>Spookyfanboy</b>: sorry don't know your actual name. I see no evidence to suggest that just because someone has paid for it they are more likely to playtest it. If someone can show me otherwise that would be very interesting. I have two established playtest groups myseld, but I think I just got lucky. One aim for the Ashcan front as it goes forwards, might be to encourage playtesting groups to develop who would be willing to try any game going for suitable compensation i.e. a copy of the book or two.<br/><b><br/>Michael Cloud</b>: I am totally for the principals of the ashcan front i.e. that of getting what I would refer to as 'blind' playtest groups together to give games a try, I just wonder if it actually did that. My reply to spookyfanboy basically covers this ground. I am glad you got help from Matt and Paul a to putting your game together and that it has inspired you to go forwards. If the ashcan front can help others in this way then I am in support of that facet of it.<br/><br/><b>The halfbaked probelm</b>: I understand that the ashcan front was setup partially as a reaction to some of the discussions earlier in the year about the readiness of some games to go to market. I am just not sure it is the best solution. I would be much more for the front helping to foster playtest groups that could help out designers, maybe creating a network of such people that prospective designers could get in contact with. I will have more thoughts on this tomorrow.<br/><br/>That is all I have for now, but I will have another read over things tomorrow and post some further thoughts.<br/><br/>All the best<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104951/#Comment_104951" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T04:31:37+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  4:31AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2007 4:33AM by ihmcallister.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry this was a whispered comment back to dave who told me how to see people's real names.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105003/#Comment_105003" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T10:32:42+00:00" title="October 26, 2007 10:32AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ihmcallister</cite><br/><b>Spookyfanboy</b>: sorry don't know your actual name.

Maybe I got spoiled by the old days, but in my day, playtesting material was bare-bones print telling you what the mechanics were, a blurb or two about the fluff, some bits here and there about what the author was going for. If you playtested and gave feedback, you received a mention in the game, and possibly a comp copy. <br/><br/>Now, like I said: Charging for these ashcans may inspire people to playtest their money's worth out of it, or it may turn people off to the whole idea.

I agree with you that there's no actual evidence (that is, reliable data) that people who pay for the Ashcan Front games (and, ashcans in general) will be more likely to playtest. It certainly could be the case. <br/><br/>That said, I don't agree. I think people who pay actually ARE more likely to playtest, and we're seeing some indication (not especially reliable, accountable information) that this tends to happen. <br/><br/>We have a very different kind of trasaction going on here that this thread does not, I think, appreciate. People are not buying product. They are not consumers. But, this thread, <i>I think</i>, assumes that they are, that all of this is just like any other exchange of money and goods. <br/><br/>Paul and I strongly disagree with that approach. We do not think this is a consumer driven issue. We believe it is a <i>hobby</i> issue, and <i>enthusiast</i> issue. It is a meaningful exchange of not only currency and product, but of strong relationships among enthusiasts. This is, we think, very different than either a <i>consumer</i> issue or a <i>collector</i> issue. (The collector issue is interesting and more murky in  this case. It's worth talking about for example with Acts of Evil. I'm not going to get into it in this post, at least.)<br/><br/>Here's what we think is going down: <br/><br/>We have two people. These people view one another as equals. They are peers. They are not producers and consumers. They are not celebrities and fans. This is <i>really</i> important to the whole thing. It's fundamental to why Paul and I did this in the first place.<br/><br/>One person has created an ashcan game, which is to say a game that is not fully complete, but that is playable and enjoyable. Part of the enjoyable of that game is noticing the few remaining gaps and helping figure out how to fill them and make the game complete. This first person needs to find new access to feedback from his or her peers. His or her other channels -- friends, online pals, whatever -- are exhausted. The person has already talked to all of them, probably playtested the game with them too. Now, he or she needs to reach out for new feedback and input. <br/><br/>We also have a second person. The second person enjoys the process of playtesting, of examining games both critically and in actual play. It is a part of their hobby they find rewarding. This is not for everyone. Not everyone in the role-playing hobby is this person. Some are, and these some are people we want to pay money for ashcans. These "some" people genuinely get a real kick out of this process, out of interacting with the creators, out of being part of the creation itself in a less direct way. It's a process, and action that they value. They are willing to pay to do this. <br/><br/>It is not a service this second person provides. It is involvement on an intimate level with a creative process they enjoy. They <i>engage</i> with the creator. The do not expect payment. Indeed, they are willing to pay money to be involved -- to be recognized, to exercise their brians, to have a little fun playing, and so on.<br/><br/>The second person pays the first person money for his or her ashcan. <br/><br/>That's what we do, and did, at the Ashcan Front. In that, it was a success. We aren't foolish enough to think that 100% of all copies sold will be this process. We want some portion of those transactions to be this. We think that happened for most, if not all, of the games sold at the booth.<br/><br/>I hope you can see how this approach -- which, again, is not going to happen 100% across the board with all people and all transactions -- informs what all of the Ashcan Front participants have done. <br/><br/>You might see, for example, why we do belive, contrary to your concern, that people will be likelier to playtest after they've  <i>paid</i> for an ashcan. You might also see, for another example, why I think the quick buck problem is not really about ashcan's as things sold, but instead about a lack of us educating people that this transaction is <i>not</i> equal to producer-consumer transactions of other products.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105021/#Comment_105021" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T12:14:42+00:00" title="October 26, 2007 12:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a recent consumer of an ashcan product I would just like to chime in in support of Matt Snyder's analysis and go one step further -- if those producing ashcans fail to recognize this peerage then their ashcan is unlikely to generate the desired results.  It's relatively easy to get praise from collectors, readers, and even players of RPGs but if you want useful criticism on a pre-production product, you'll want to take advantage of the critical nature of a peer review.<br/><br/>When your game design meets players that have no pre-knowledge of the game -- that is, they haven't read it before and they haven't played it with one of the game designers or someone in constant contact with the game designer -- the issues that come up in understanding and enjoying the game are ALL relevant.  They will mostly represent defects that don't exist in the game you have in your head but do exist in the rules that got printed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105031/#Comment_105031" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T12:57:35+00:00" title="October 26, 2007 12:57PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for writing that, Matt.

I enjoying designing games and helping my fellow designers including playtesting their games when I get the chance. I have met many other deisgners through places like story games, the forge and the collective endeaour and am admittedly more likely to help out on projects when I know the individual concerned. These relationships help me design games and gives me the feedback I need.<br/><br/>Now I don't understand why you think that adding money to the relationships that spring up between fellow designers will give them more incentive to playtest each others games. If I like your project and am interested in design I will give my feedback gratis. I would be much more for helping people find playtest groups, maybe starting up a seperate site that specialises in helping people find such groups, and guiding feedback. Would the ashcan front being doing such a thing as it moves forwards?<br/><br/>When you were selling the ashcans at gencon how were you getting across the good intentions of the ashcan front? Were you telling each buyer individually what the deal was?<br/><br/>Could you also answer my question regarding the guidance you gave people as to what constituted an ashcan.<br/><br/>I really do think the intentions of the AF are good, I just don't think that putting money into the equation is necessary. <br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105104/#Comment_105104" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T06:54:36+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  6:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2007 7:05AM by Matt Snyder.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When you were selling the ashcans at gencon how were you getting across the good intentions of the ashcan front?

I'd say we'd gave a sufficient pitch to, oh, 80% of the customers there.<br/><br/>I thought I did answer about the guidance, but I guess not! Paul and I communicated with people via email. We did not grill them with many, many questions. We asked about the game, and got a range of answers "It's playtested." Or, "I've finished the text" or whatever. Obviously, we wanted them to have read and accepted the FAQ as a basic approach. <br/><br/>Regardless, we received enough information that we were satisfied with the states of the games as ashcans. When we finally saw the games at GenCon, we were very pleased. All games were, in my view, sufficient as ashcans. There were clearly games in various state. That "90%" thing tripped people up more than it helped. It was short hand for "Playable, preferably playtested games." <br/><br/>All the games were playable. The  vast majority of them were playtested at least once or twice. There may have been a couple that were not previously playtested. <br/><br/>Paul might be able to inform more, but I personally did not have to guide many participants much prior to the con. They showed up with ashcans. From my perspective, it was a cinch. <br/><br/>Oh. We did exchange group emails prior to the con some, and that probably also involved some clarification about what the 90% thing was short hand for, maybe clarified some questions. I can't recall specifically. Again, Paul probably did a bit more guidance than I did.<br/><br/>EDIT TO ADD: We did not "approve" the game prior to the con. I did provide feedback on the text and layout of Psi-Run. But, that was because Chris and Michael asked me to and offered the PDF. I did not see any of the other games' texts until the con.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105107/#Comment_105107" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T07:57:11+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  7:57AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kevin Allen Jr</cite>I pushed back my release date for Sweet Agatha 2 months, based a lot on what i saw at gencon.

When I talked to you at GenCon and learned that you were going final in September, I felt like if I didn't get a chance to play the game within about 2 weeks of getting home that you couldn't have used my feedback anyway.

I see on the site Acts of Evil, Giants and Psi Run are getting a lot of feedback but I can't see many others on there. I seem to remeber a good number of games on the ashcan front but I am not sure of percentages.</blockquote>\nI haven't received any playtest feedback from Know Thyself, and I don't necessarily expect to anytime soon.  I hope to have some at some point, but I don't have any idea when that'll be.<br/><br/>That said, honestly, just having it out in front of people and explaining the game over and over at GenCon highlighted some issues I have to deal with.\n<blockquote>2) This goes to all deisgners who designed an ashcan. Since releasing your ashcan have you had second thoughts, beacuase of feedback or otherwise, about releasing the full version? I ask this as the games that were meant to go to ashcan were supposed to be around 90% complete and have had some playtesting before they hit public release. I have a concern that people may be rushing games out without even playtesting them themselves.</blockquote>\nI know I playtested the hell out of my game, especially in the last two months.  But that was all with my at the table, mostly with my own play group.  The custom card deck is a bit of a hurdle in getting others to beta-test it, which is the main reason I made the ashcan.\n<blockquote>3) Quality I have found is an interesting one. ...  Do you think it made others feel 'bad' about the quality of their own ashcans? Do you think releasing such a professional looking book as an ashcan will harm the final product, or even cause dissapointment when it releases?</blockquote>\nHonestly, when I saw the covers of Kingdom of Nothing &amp; Acts of Evil, I felt like the bar was raised, so I tried to put a bit more effort into my own production.  I can't say I feel "bad" about it, but I did worry that my plain cover would be looked over by my potential target audience.  Then again, I'm also the guy who printed his own custom, full-color cards, so maybe I didn't have as much to worry about.\n<blockquote>4) This next one needs a little explanation first. I have a concern that some designers will release games well before they are ready, before they reach that sort of 90% playtested stage of things, using the aschan front to make a quick buck as it were. The reason I have this concern is I have seen similar things happen in computer game s recently where designer would release games that aren't ready and then use microtransactions to patch them later, or just patch them later. Now I would hope that no one would do this but I think it remains a legitimate concern, and I worry that releasing an ashcan might be the final step for some people.</blockquote>\nBefore GenCon, I thought my game was at around 80%-85%.  After GenCon, I honestly went home feeling like I had a hell of a longer road in front of me.  This was my first experience being on that side of the table, and I learned a ton of stuff about what I need to do differently next time.  So, I do feel like I rushed the ashcan too soon, and actually feel a bit guilty for that (though, again, I didn't know about this until I gained this experience, so it's kinda of Catch-22).<br/><br/>But, as to "make a quick buck," honestly, there are easier ways than trying to convince someone that buying your unfinished game and then giving you feedback is worth their money.  I'd have an easier time begging for money on a street corner -- at least that transaction isn't one I'd have to keep explaining to people.  I charged a fair amount for my ashcan in order to make sure people wouldn't just buy it for the cards.  In hindsight, I should have priced it lower and hoped that people would buy it for the cards, just in case they might give the game a try.  But I had no idea what sort of turn-out there would be and what I should have expected.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I'm barely under covering my costs at the booth and printing, and if it wasn't for the fact that my photographer refused to give me an invoice for his work, I would be fairly well in the red due to the project right now.  So, from the "one of the most expensive ashcans" point-of-view, I wasn't exactly milking it.<br/><br/>I'd like to add:  In a lot of ways, I wasn't just ashcanning Know Thyself, but I was ashcanning myself.  I learned a shit load from the experience and have to thank Paul &amp; Matt for their hard work and the opportunity.  Yeah, I know this sounds very after-school-special, but it's the truth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.
