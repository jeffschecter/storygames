(I don't have time to post all the links at this moment.  I'm just trying to get this thread up.)<br/><br/>Josh has a bunch of questions across several threads, but it seems to me there's a commonality to the issue at hand.<br/><br/>I believe this topic has a broader application than to just the <i>Sorcerer</i> rules, but we're going to be focusing on <i>Sorcerer</i> for now. Other games can be brought in as examples for points, of course.<br/><br/>So, in one thread, Josh writes:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballyhoo Roby</cite>Okay, so the system gives me this sturm-und-drang dice mechanic that basically gives me a pile of dice in front of me to tell me how much advantage I have in the particular situation, and it's up to me, working together with my fellow players in groupthink, to figure out what that advantage means.  Does the game give me any tools to help negotiate differences of opinion in the group?  Why exactly do I need this die mechanic?</blockquote>\nIn another thread he writes, in response to a quote from Jesse:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballyhoo Roby</cite><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Even more so there may be more than one way to legally resolve that ambiguity and which of the options is more appropriate depends entirely on the greater creative context of the narrative.</blockquote>\nWho is the arbiter on what is appropriate to the greater creative context of the narrative?<br/><br/><br/>Now, at this point I get the impression Josh is after something that is still unstated, and I neither want to put words in his mouth nor make assumptions about answering questions that aren't the question he's asking.  <br/><br/>With that caveat in mind, I'm going to quote a response Jesse made.<br/><br/>Jesse wrote:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/><br/>The answer to all your questions is always going to be the same: It's the music metaphor.  It's about call and response among an ALREADY creatively synergistic group.  Sorcerer wasn't designed with the idea that total strangers would play together.<br/><br/>If it helps, the GM very much has a leadership role, which is different from "control."  For example, Sorcerer strongly recommends that the GM comes to the group with a strong aesthetic vision that the other plays buy into, such as the outlines for my Gothic Fantasy setting I carry around with me.  This is analogous to someone saying, "I'm starting a Rock 'n' Roll band."<br/><br/>If someone suddenly busts out The Blues in the middle of my Rock 'n' Roll band, it's an obvious and easily corrected social blunder.<br/><br/>Jesse</blockquote>\n<br/>From here, if Joshua could explicate what's up, that'd be great, because right now I'm somewhat confused.  In the example he gives of (an admittedly) <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5950&amp;page=1#Item_16" rel="nofollow">lame exchange</a> between the GM and a Player, he asks, "How does the mechanics prevent this from happening?  And if it doesn't, why do we have the mechanics?"<br/><br/>This <i>almost</i> makes sense as a question if you think that the purpose of rules to prevent lameness.  And maybe some games work that way.  <br/><br/>However, I see the purpose of Sorcerer's rules as to <i>engage risk</i> -- creative risk.  They are a tool or instrument used to facilitate social story telling.  To get a die bonus, you add color and detail.  When results come up during multi-character conflicts, Players must come up with creative justifications on the fly.  It's about responding to the next beat of conflict that leads toward the Resolution of the Kicker.  It's about the GM tossing out creative and compelling Bangs that provoke more cool responses from the Players.  It's about coming up with details about relationships and more that demand -- as the dice are rolled, cool, evocative color.  It's a focusing tool to elicit details of story.<br/><br/>And you might fail.  <i>That's the point. </i>  You might toss out a crappy Bang, or come up with a bit of detail that will get you a die bonus that gets no reaction from the table and so falls flat.  The risk is there.  It is required.  Because the <i>expectation</i> of the game is that everyone will be doing the best to be at the top of their creative game.<br/><br/>In Josh's example of the lame exchange, I don't see either the Player or the GM trying anything interesting creatively.  And so they're missing the whole point of the game.<br/><br/><br/>Now, what is interesting is the question, "Why the rules, then?  Why not just sit down and write a story as a group?"  <br/><br/>Well, as someone who is sitting around writing stories most of the day I can only say because it's a fun experience to make things up, moment by moment, with a group of fun people.  That's all I got.  And the <i>Sorcerer</i> rules -- and I'm including the dice mechanics here -- focus creative thinking here: "Okay, I won the roll, but she's backing away.  She's scared because something wrong... What is the detail of fiction, color or human behavior <i>we haven't tried yet</i> that will close the deal between these two characters?"<br/><br/>That's it.  That's what I got.<br/><br/>The game isn't there to prevent lameness.  It's there to create the risk of it, and the <i>success</i> of the game is when you and your fellow players are creating something great.  Because just as it offers the risk of lameness, it offers the opportunity for great, synergistic creative excellence.<br/><br/>So, Josh, does that start us in the right direction?  Or are you talking about something else?<br/><br/>CK                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133297/#Comment_133297" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T13:13:49+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  1:13PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CK,<br/><br/>Focusing tool -- That's a good term and what I was trying to get at in my System &amp; Narrative.  The rules do produce creative and social limits but not in a vacuum.  The social creative synergy of the group is a vital component and the game will fail if you try to apply the rules in a detached chess like manner.  You won't see the limits just reading the rules.  You probably won't see the limits just playing the game once either.<br/><br/>It's like turning on a juicer and wondering why no juice is coming out.  You have to put the fruit in it.  The juicer is an awesome tool but if there's no fruit, you're not going to get any juice.  The emotional, creative and social commitment of the group to the fiction is the fruit.

They don't always complement each other.  The thing I like to see in a game is procedures that bring us together, that weave our differences into something beautiful and grand.  So to me, this is the big gaping hole in <em>Sorcerer</em>.</blockquote>\nI hear and can dig the talk about throwing out bangs and evocative character choices and everything in the hopes that it contributes to the collective story that we're all participating in.  I totally get that.  What I'm not seeing, however, is any way in which the rules and procedures of <em>Sorcerer</em> actually promote or support that.<br/><br/>You get rewarded for adding details?  Well, sort of -- you get a die, which means nothing, because no matter how the die rolls or if it spawns off more victory dice and becomes a big massive pool of dice that roll successes, it still doesn't mean anything.  I can roll a hundred successes but that still doesn't mean anything if my fellow player doesn't want it to.<br/><br/>Contrast this with <em>In a Wicked Age</em> where my win does mean something -- it means I can Exhaust or Injure you.  Now, I can totally trade those in to get something else out of you, something better or more valuable in my eyes, but if you and I can't come to any agreement, something still <em>happens</em>.  In <em>Sorcerer</em>, if we come to an impasse, the game fails, and fails dead.  And I'm sorry, but no amount of allusions to a jazz band is going to help me out of that mess.<br/><br/>So, to sum up: I get the sense of the gameplay that is being attributed to <em>Sorcerer</em>.  I'm not seeing how the rules actually make that happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133331/#Comment_133331" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T14:33:03+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  2:33PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course you can contrast that with a traditional game (i.e. one without social conflict rules, or with only really lame ones, like GURPS) where you have the same issue, fiat (or as I might prefer to call it, playing characters with an eye only to your / their own desires) often leading to just that sort of impasse. Sorcerer tries to get out of that impasse by saying you can't just keep insisting that you block something without dice to back you up, but I think Josh is saying that all it does is transfer the obstinacy from saying 'no' to thinking up yet another way to say no creatively. i.e. it may inspire imaginative play, but only in ways to block the other player, because the dice don't ever force you to stop blocking.<br/><br/>Of course trad systems often *do* offer a way out of that situation (other than fiat) where the target is an NPC, they just let you make a roll and succeed, as you would with a physical attack. It's usually only PCs that get this glow of "can't be forced into social action"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133336/#Comment_133336" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T14:49:06+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  2:49PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>And the<i>Sorcerer</i>rules -- and I'm including the dice mechanics here -- focus creative thinking here: "Okay, I won the roll, but she's backing away.

Essentially, <i>Sorcerer's</i> mechanics present the sketch to bridge between complete blank-page, open horizons, teeth-gnashing "what do we do next?" storytelling, and dictating what happens.  In essence, they present a niftily malleable Mad-Lib to riff off of.  They ask leading-yet-open questions to help direct the storytelling, where just sitting down with creative friends might drift and meander.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballyhoo Roby</cite>I can roll a hundred successes but that still doesn't mean anything if my fellow player doesn't want it to.<br/><br/>Contrast this with In a Wicked Age where my win does mean something -- it means I can Exhaust or Injure you.<br/></blockquote>\nIf you'll forgive me, Josh, I think maybe you're getting a little to attached to your point.  I think the contrast there is between a quite hard and a very very soft limit.  Yes: in <i>Sorcerer</i> you could play out a conflict <i>ad infinitum,</i> even just counting on your ability to narrate new stuff indefinitely (and possibly interestingly) rather than just blocking and accepting increasing penalties.  But all those successes <em>do</em> mean something: they have a concrete advantage going forward, and so long as we're considering that in the narration, further tacks in a lopsided conflict are increasingly doomed to failure.  You come to a point where you can mechanically prolong the conflict, but can't ever expect to overcome.  I think the fruitful way to look at that (be it explicit in the text or not - it's been quite a while) is as the increasingly pointed question about how you lose, or what more desperate thing you attempt, underscored with the idea that your answer is on balance with your group's social contract.<br/><br/>The contrast is: <i>In a Wicked Age</i> presents the choice: do you lose effectiveness, or something else - crunchy mechanics or fiction + mechanics?  <i>Sorcerer</i> asks: is trying one more thing worth the amount your friends will think you're a dick - fiction or social?  I can certainly see a reasonable criticism being brought against either game on those bases, but there's something a little bombastic about saying that the <i>Sorcerer</i> conflict dicing doesn't do anything meaningful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133340/#Comment_133340" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:19:19+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also think that by focusing on the dice mechanic we might be overlooking another part of the system. Isn't it implicit in Sorcerer that part of the system is respecting the existing fictional events and history that have been aired to the group and accepted by them? This means that a player's contribution has to dovetail with the existing fictional situation and history. Each time a player makes an assertion and rolls the dice, he's established something in the fiction and anyone's next assertion has to respect that. This is how options are narrowed. The dice system provides increasing pressure with increasing penalties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133350/#Comment_133350" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:35:08+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:35PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what we have is a dice mechanic that doles out social pressure: "That's sure a lot of dice in front of the GM, you should probably give up."

There's a pressure in a band to "play along."  If you've got a groove you're into, there's only so long you can doggedly pursue it without the implicit agreement from your band mates (who agree by picking it up and riffing with it) before you're just being discordant.  There's not really a hard line about where that is, and the difference between your groove being awesome and you being a dick is whether the rest of the band picks up on the line, or if you stick with it past that illusive point where it's no longer cool.<br/><br/>To be honest, as I've started to grok that it's a fiction v. social contract tension (and I think and hope that I grok rightly), it's kind of a fascinating dynamic.

Like the person in my weekly game who hates the thought of her characters being hurt or disadvantaged, and always shies away from allowing things to happen to her that she doesn't like, even if they are her own disadvantages, or her story goals, or bits of physics that everyone else thinks are plausible or even certain. She's not an idiot, but she blocks without even thinking about it                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133460/#Comment_133460" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T08:56:03+00:00" title="March  8, 2008  8:56AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or just someone who thinks A would be really cool while you're sitting there thinking "A?!

I've seen many a player pick and even embrace such disadvantages, and then get really unhappy over some particular circumstance when they are being led into danger by them. All of a suddenly they have any number of reasons why *this time* it shouldn't apply.<br/><br/>I often see the same thing where physics is concerned. People have some idea of what they want their character to do, and then get annoyed at the fact that the rules tell them it is implausible. What do you mean I have to make a climbing roll to scale a rope, in a slime filled mine shaft, in the dark, while being chased by a monster, upside down, when I've never done it before, and have a bucket of acid in my mouth?<br/><br/>Sometimes of course you just wave the mechanics away and go with it anyway, because it's cool, but sometimes it is blocking to say "nahh, I don't like the potential consequences of failing my crazy plan, I'd just like it to work and not worry about it". This becomes especially bad when other players disagree, and think your plan *is* implausible, and of course you should be rolling some dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133482/#Comment_133482" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T12:19:36+00:00" title="March  8, 2008 12:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2008 12:21PM by Alan.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David,<br/><br/>I saw this kind of behavior all the time in HERO system and I think GURPS is very similar in this respect.<br/><br/>In GURPS, if I recall correctly, dice rolls determine whether a task can be completed. Failure of a dice roll generally means the character wasn't able to do something. Also, the more dramatic or wild the action is, the higher the chance they will fail. This means that anytime a player starts something that will require a dice roll, they risk having their character look uncool, despite all the points they spent making the character competent and setting up an image. <br/><br/>Also, failures result in reducing the character's ability to act, either by wounds or putting them in mechanical disadvantages. In GURPS, the character is pretty much a player's only way to affect what's going on, so disabling the character disables the player.<br/><br/>Does the reward of playing a disadvantage balance the risk of rolling dice? I recall that a player can earn 1 or 2 XP at the end of the session by playing a disad. I'm guessing that many players don't feel this is worthwhile.<br/><br/>The nature of dice roll results in GURPS may also be why your group is happy waving rolls aside in some cases.<br/><br/>Part of the recent wave of new game design is about addressing these problems -- making "disadvantages" elements that actually give the player more influence over the game or designing dice resolution so no character looks uncool unless their player wants them to. I've played many of these games and I don't see any of the "blocking" or resistance I used to see in Champions or D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133651/#Comment_133651" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T01:41:34+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  1:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>The nature of dice roll results in GURPS may also be why your group is happy waving rolls aside in some cases.</blockquote>\nThe point I was trying to make is that we are *not* consistently doing this. It is blocking precisely because one player's expectations in this regards are out of line with the others. The majority of players are happy to make the roll, while one is wanting to ignore them.<br/><br/>One person's blocking is another person's gaming style, in other words. There is nothing wrong with the 'I always look cool' style, it's just out of place in the game we are playing, hence the tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
