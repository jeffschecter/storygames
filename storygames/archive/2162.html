                    I can't understand RPG.net. The whole thing moves too fast for me to work out. I'd really appreciate some tips.<br/><br/>How do you find the interesting stuff and then keep an eye on it? Are some forums more useful than others: and, if so, which ones? How do you, personally, keep up to date with it, given that there's so much information?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            I only ever read Tabletop RPG.  There's probably good stuff I'm missing, but hey ... you can't drink the ocean.<br/>
<br/>
I always watch the "Photoshop RPG Motivational Posters" thread, because it's funny.<br/>
<br/>
Then I scan for the little ticks that tell me I've responded to a thread.  I try to keep up with stuff I've contributed to.<br/>
<br/>
And while I'm doing that, I let my eye wander over the titles of threads.  If something looks interesting then I check (a) its first page and (b) its most recent page.  If it's more than five pages (fifty posts) in already then it's a "read-only" for me ... in most cases I won't want to spend the energy to catch up on the entirety of the thread in order to post knowledgeably, and I make it a policy not to post on a thread I don't entirely understand.<br/>
<br/>
But in the rare case where I find something interesting in its infancy, I get a post in, and then the next time I come back it will have one of those little tick-marks, and I'll catch up on it.<br/>
<br/>
There's an art to it ... drinking from the firehose without getting the full brunt.                        </div>

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there aren't worthwhile discussions happening out there. Just that I can't see any possible way to keep on top of it all. That's why I stick mostly to places like this.<br/>

That's a pretty good analogy.  Anyway, I read the columns a lot and I check out the Tabletop forum.  Thankfully half the threads there are about Exalted and since I don't play that game, it cuts down on the reading.  The real problem comes with participation.  A thread will hit page 3 in less than 10 minutes sometimes.  It especially makes it hard in the Game Design forum.  By the time I can get to someone to make a meaningful comment, there's already been 10 suggestions.  It seems futile.  But, there are plenty of good points about the site.  I just wouldn't get too emotionally invested in it.<br><br>Peace,<br><br>-Troy                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            The point of RPG.Net (for me) is that once a week I will say, "WTF?!" in response to two idiots arguing something utterly and completely asinine.  And once every two weeks I will say, "Whoa, that is a really cool idea for a setting."<br/>
<br/>
I check out the Tabletop Open forum every other day, and the Actual Play forums once every few weeks.  I only look at the first page of each.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best threads in recent memory: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?referrerid=&amp;t=261519&amp;highlight=tarrasque" rel="nofollow">City Built Around the Tarrasque</a><br/>
<br/>
I also liked <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?referrerid=&amp;t=250634&amp;highlight=trollbabe+heart-ripper=" rel="nofollow">The best Trollbabe AP ever</a><br/>
<br/>
My favorite WTF? moment was, in one of TonyLB's threads, some dude got all bent out of shape trying to argue that more people knew about Buffy the Vampire Slayer than knew about Dracula, which had nothing to do with the point of the thread.  And then Tony had the most sensible reaction in the world--and got booted for it.                        </div>

<p>The way I use RPG.net is that people I don't know post there and I notice that they're linking to and buying my games from a thread, which I'll usually watch. I find that the site makes me too mad to be worth a lot of effort.</p>
<p>To accent this effect, I look for science fiction-based threads and try to say something thoughtful and people click on my .sig.</p>

                            I use subscriptions (with no notification).

Like what threads its best to avoid posting in and what people it's not worth replying to.

                            I've been a member of RPGNet since 1999. I still totally think of myself first and foremost as "an RPGNetter" (actually, it was the board's creator Sandy Antunes who accidentally helped me hook up with some awesome gaming groups when I was in Japan, too, and that's right around when I joined).<br><br>I have no idea how I keep up. I must have a bunch of tricks that I've internalized.<br><br>I pretty much don't post much anymore unless something blows me away.<br><br>I usually stick only to Page One. I never go to Page Two unless it's the summer and they're getting the "40 topics scrolling in 2-4 hours" effect that builds up around GenCon, in which case I never to to Page Three.<br><br>A lot of folks that I loved to interact with there have left, or have found other ways to keep their discussions going (like Mike Gentry, who does all his RPGtalk through his blog, and very occasionally still reads RPGNet and the like. Or, like, what I did here by creating S-G). Sure, there's new cool people to replace them and all, too. Still, though, they're friends.<br/><br/>I check out Other Games Open/Video Games, and Other Media. Those are usually RPG-Centric people who talk about stuff that gamers would be into. And there's not as much traffic, which is nice. I also scan the Buy/Trade forum for good deals when I suddenly realize "I need to Buy L5R 1st Edition!" or whatever. I haven't found Game Design useful at all there, but others have.<br/><br/>I'm not fond of moderation these days, but I understand all the crap they have to deal with. On the other hand, a lot of that crap they bring upon themselves (by keeping the Tangency forums going, which has turned from "Happy Birthday" and "Cool News" to "10-20 People's Daily Forum Livejournals" over the past few years). I still like the moderators as people, just not the stinky jobs they have to do, or the way they do it sometimes.<br/><br/>But, I haven't given up completely on RPG Open. I only skim it 1-2 times a day these days (sometimes 4-6). If a topic comes along that I really am interested in, I subscribe to it. The best stuff I've gotten out of it over the years have been game recs, meetups, game trade/sell deals, and great ideas from others for ideas to use in my own games.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            The more I use SG, the less I use RPG.net.<br/>
<br/>
I've found a couple of problems happen on RPG.net that I think both Thomas and Andy highlighted in their post.<br/>
<br/>
Double standards from certain mods is one thing that ticks me off.  Lately, although it's never happened to me I've seen people bawled out for essentially not being psychic as to what one of the mods might think someone, somewhere might find slightly offensive.  Essentially it's got to the point where I feel like I can't actually say anything there because I might upset some mod's politically correct agenda and get banned.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that there are a handful of very, very vocal fucktards there who simply don't seem to absorb anything anyone says.  You'll get arguments like this;<br/>
<br/>
R: Yeah, I think you'll find Sweden is a continent somewhere near China.<br/>
Me: WTF?  Sweden's, like, part of Scandinavia!  It's right next to Norway!<br/>
R: Are you listening to me?  Sweden's right there, south east of China, it's always been there.  I flew there a few years ago.  It was pretty hot.<br/>
Me: Er, with all due respect, I think you're incorrect.<br/>
R: Look here on a map, see here?  S W E D E N! Right there in the water next to New Zealand, where Elves come from!<br/>
<br/>
The Ignore List is your friend.  Someone also created a Greasemonkey script to make all the threads about Exalted disappear.<br/>
That makes RPGOpen much more readable, about 2/3rds the size.<br/>
<br/>
They recently split Video Games discussion out of the Games-which-are-not-RPGs forum, which needed to have been done a great many years ago IMO.  It means you can actually find a discussion about a boardgame or something before it gets buried under a ton of comments about WoW or CoH.  I'm kinda of the opinion that RPGNet ought to be for discussion tabletop games, but that's just me.  I post in other videogames forums when I want to discuss that kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
There's another kind of poster who I find really interesting, and that's the kind who post a lot, but never in the roleplaying sections.  They'll talk about WoW, their jobs and politics and hang around in the Trouble Tickets section answerring questions as if they were one of the moderators, but never talk about RPGs at all.  I mean, fair enough, but doesn't that seem a bit weird?<br/>

                            Tony's got it about right, though I got <a href="http://www.neko-machi.com/comics/2006-09-24.jpg" rel="nofollow">completely sick</a> of the motivational posters meme months ago (though I've been subjected to them from plenty of other sources too). I mostly just skim the Tabletop/RPG Open board looking for any subject likes that look interesting. Before this place (and indie RPG blogs) I mostly found out about new RPGs through there, and to a lesser extent I still do. It's where I first heard about OVA, and of course Panty Explosion.<br><br>There are also the occasional total train wrecks of threads (which often happens when Palladium comes up) that I read out of some perverse desire to be entertained.<br><br>I usually ignore the other RPG.net forums unless I'm really bored. The new video games forum always seems to be mostly about MMOs (which I don't play at all), and Tangency reminds me too much of a more grown up version of Gaia Online.<br><br>I check to see what games are being reviewed on the front page too, but I can't remember the last time I actually read a review there.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            My tactics are similar to what most people have already said: don't look past page 2 of the forum, never post a reply (or continue reading) after a thread goes pear-shaped and turns into an idiotic argument, and so on.  Those are basic skills for reading any forum with more than a few dozen posters.<br><br>I also don't bother reading over 90% of the threads there, if not more.  To some extent, this is easy, because most threads are clearly labeled as being uninteresting/useless to me (e.g., anything that starts with "[Exalted]"), and the rest can be weeded out by just hovering my mouse over the subject and reading the first-paragraph popup.  When I find a thread I'm actually interested in, I skim it quickly first, and then read the stuff that caught my eye.  I also cut my losses: when a thread isn't delivering anything useful, entertaining, or interesting anymore, I stop reading it.  <br><br>Adjust the percentages to match your own interests/free time/patience, and you're set.  The key to enjoying participating in a thriving discussion forum with lots of members is learning to be a vicious and uncompromising editor: know what you don't want, and brutally remove those things from your field of view.  You may throw out a few gems with the garbage, but those are acceptable losses.<br><br><br>Oh, and avoid Tangency like you would any other open sewer.  But that's just common sense.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I've found the discussion to be increasingly indie-friendly, too.  Since I've been there long enough, I also sort threads by looking who's posting there -- this only works if you've been around a while, of course, and know who's worth reading.  But I really value reading guys like "spatulalad", who is a super GM but I doubt would ever post here.

You're doing a good job.  I haven't ever flagged you as a hard-selling game-pimping designer, and there are lots of them.                        </br></br></div>

                            If you look at the number of posts in each forum, you'll see that the idea that RPG.net is primarily a place to discuss RPGs is dead-on false. Most discussions there aren't even vaguely related to RPGs. It's a chat site, pure and simple.<br/><br/>Once you internalize that, you'll get a lot better use out of the place (even when you are talking about RPGs.)                        </div>

                            I sorta feel that RPGnet is a hobby unto itself.  It's too time consuming.  Basically I think I tend to be about a more intimate crowd, like here.  I think this is true of any such community that gets popular.  To be honest even the Forge has gotten too big for me and thus one of the reasons I look for interesting Forge stuff through the SG filter.  Same goes for RPGnet.<br/><br/>Every once in a while I will browse and I do find some funny threads like the <i>Dumbest thing you've ever seen in a game</i> thread.  LOL                        </div>

                            There's an impressive level of fan support, like the "Exalted Combat 101" threads that Kasumi wrote.  It's more than the game deserves, really.  Also, it's got a lot of stuff that's fun to talk about: an intricate setting and cosmology, lots of tricky rules for Charms, crunchy combat.  And they've got people like Stephenls, who is the most amazing Exalted geek, even though he never actually plays.  It's impossible to imagine someone like him existing for an indie game -- there's not enough to talk about in the absence of actual play.                        </div>

                            Shreyas is on the money. <br><br>Exalted is a game that might as well have been tailor made for RPG.net, and when the game first came out a lot of really fabulous fan work happened on the sight (due partly to JD also being right and other Exalted sites blowing goats). That quality, investment, and market focus lead to a very strong community of fans, creators, and real energy that turned large parts of RPG.net into the Exalted boards. <br><br/>But nothing lasts forever, and energy like that is hard to maintain.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            I'm a pretty active RPGnet poster, although RPGnet and  I have a love/hate-relationship going on. On one hand, there are many great people there and many of them start incredibly threads full of awesome ideas. On the other hand, there are people there I'd have loved to strangle with barbed wire more times then I can count and some of the discussions make me regularly doubt humanity. RPGnet is a forum of extremes: Good threads are really, <i>really</i> good, but bad threads are really, <i>really</i> bad too. (Sometimes, RPGnet is a bit like deserts or polar regions: Beautiful, fascinating and awesome, but some of those storms will rip your skin off in no time.)<br/><br/>The way I use RPGnet is this: Most of the time, I only read Tabletop Open. Sometimes, when I feel like it, I visit The Wilde Side, Trouble Tickets or Tangency (This one generally around monday, to see wether there's an interesting Porn Monday thread.) When I first log in, I browse all the "new" threads up to the point where I was last logged in (I generally log in at least every two days, so that's about page 2-5.), tabbing (Firefox rocks.) all the threads that sound interesting. Then I read them, discarding some after the first two posts when I'm not interested or reading some that catch my interest completly. Whenever a thread is interesting enough to make me post, it's automatically added to my "Subscribed threads" (Without Notification), so finding it again just means a klick ob "Subscribed Threads". And when RPGnet once again makes me want to kill somebody, I go and read other things, like webcomics or Story Games, to calm down a bit. Having an Ignore List that I can put the biggest idiots on when they get on my nerves helps too. ^_^                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite>Oh, sure, tell me anything you've got.</blockquote>Well, the rough sketch then:<ul><li>Things you can do:  You can get <i>some people</i> to think of you as a person who says useful things.  That doesn't have a lot of spread outside of the type of conversations <b>they</b>, in turn, frequent ... but if you choose a topic of interest then you can get a little sub-community in the board that gives a sense of continuity.  If you've got a .sig (as Joshua rightly points out) that sense of "this is a good person" has been known to translate into sales, so that's a nice thing.</li><li>Things you cannot do:  You cannot make yourself known to the entire board, and more than you can speak directly to every person in America.  That means that you can never expect to get any better treatment than anyone else, simply because the vast majority of your readers will be reading you for the first time.  There is no distinction between you and "everyone else."</li></ul>Within those limits, calm, productive, overwhelmingly positive posting is a great means to an end.  Yes, some people will attack you (I'm convinced that on the internet <i>someone</i> can always be found to hate any proposition) and if you stay positive then their opinion <i>will not matter</i>, except inasmuch as their posting style draws attention to how cool you are.  Somebody out there is gonna get jazzed about what you're jazzed about ... even if they don't actually post.  So that's lonely, but good.<br/><br/>Am I making any sense?                        </div>

                            That's about as accurate a summation of how it works as any I've ever seen, right down to the "someone can always be found to hate any proposition" clause.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><br/>I have a confession to make:  I don't pay any attention at all to who posted an article.  You know how when you're driving along the highway, your brain just edits out the power lines and the billboards, so even though they're basically omnipresent you never notice them?  That's what I do with the little bit in between posts that identify the user.  This is generally true on every forum I go to, but especially so on high-volume boards like RPG.net where you're likely to see an entirely different bunch of users in every thread.<br/><br/>When I notice someone by name, it's because they've written something thoughtful and useful in enough of the threads I've actually read that I've bothered to look up and notice their name.  And that's about as valuable to them as it sounds (by which I mean "completely worthless"), but in the long run it does seem to make me feel better-disposed towards their work.                        </div>

                            That's pretty much it. And then the moderators either acted, depending on your point of view, promptly and responsibly / hastily and stupidly.

                            Actually probably the best way to get something out of RPGNet is to look at all the threads that Levi Kornelson starts.  Also, mimic everything Levi Kornelson does.  For extra credit, frame Levi for a crime he didn't commit, get plastic surgery, and live his life instead of yours.  Because Levi is the RPGNet Buddha.                        </div>

                            As I said at Levi's place, RPG.net is that big pub where you can see all sorts of people, but it's a bit noisy to be intimate.<br/><br/>I drop in for a drink frequently, but I don't stick around long. Everybody's busy talking to a dozen other people. And the bouncers have an attitude.                        </div>

Yeah, it had something to do with copyright infringement and how Jared was just giving up on the whole thing.  People FREAKED OUT when Wicl posted about it on RPGnet.  The funny part wasn't the fact it was a joke, but how the mods flipped out over the incident and banned them both.  I imagine if those two had it to do all over again knowing the consequences, they'd do it exactly the way they did.  It's one of the best 'net pranks I ever witnessed (surpassing even White Wolf's prank the year or two before).<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

I think the big Piss Off was from the fact that folks started forming "Save Jared" militias before anyone got to point out that it wasn't for real, hence the spanking that was handed down.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd have just made those guys buy everyone a virtual beer...                        </div>

                            Oh, a couple other things (and remember, I'm an RPGNetter through and through)<br/><br/>At RPGNet, one off-topic post that gains weight could totally bring down a thread.  I actually like posting OT stuff here (chatter, jokes, one-liners) cause with the smaller community it's harder to derail a thread. <br/><br/>And here's something really bizarre that I just realized now: I just saw JDCorley post in some thread on RPGNet.  I never really put the name to the "Theif: The Dark Project Runes" avatar.  Over on RPGNet... I forgot when (maybe it was the "These games are RPGs, those are not" flamewars) I was like, "Damn, this guy says cool stuff like once in a hundred posts, but he's a total asshole most of the time. What a fucker".  And yet, over here, he's one of the folks who I read like every post of, and agree with way more often than not; as a poster/reader here at S-G (not speaking with Mod Authority or whatever), <i>he's one of my favorite posters</i>.  That totally blew my mind, and I'm wondering now where/why my perceptions over at RPGNet got all bent up.  <br/><br/>If I went back and read a bunch of his stuff, I'd probably see it in a new light now, my bad perception of him was probably tainted at the time by whatever lame grudge I got on that developed out of some lame pissy-fit we were all involved in, the origins of which are now forgotten. That's really a kinda interesting phenomenon, IMO. I'm glad to have had those perceptions gunned down.                        </div>

                            Personally, I like RPGNet, but I only go in four threads regularly (and dip into Tangency once in a while if something funny crops up). Usually though I stick to Open Promo, and the three 'About the Industry' threads. Those usually move at a manageable pace and are relatively free of flame-wars and snidery.<br/><br/>Oh, I check the reviews from time to time as well if there's a topic there I'm interested in, but I don't generally find them very useful.<br/><br/>Ash                        </div>

                            I drift in and cherry pick threads to read, generally in Open, Promo and Business. Sometimes I venture into Other Media. It's pretty like any unfocused forum, everybody is there for a different reason and everybody is talking at cross purposes.<br/><br/>Learning which posters to follow is a really useful tactic. Levi, Tony, Judd and the sadly missed Tesujin28 are among the folks who flag a thread as worth reading.                        </div>

You know, I'd dearly love to see that. I have a strange fascination with seeing Tony treated badly. Mostly to see and admire how he conducts himself, I think. But also probably because i'm a sick bastard.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

That's pretty much textbook "bad" RPG.net: The guy Tony's shouting at seems to be incapable of not acting like that, and the moderator concerned really likes to throw his weight around.<br/><br/>There was a recent case where he tried to permanently ban someone for using a smiley.<br/><br/>It can be great, but it's like shopping at charity shops.

                            I tend to distinguish communities by their flavour.<br/><br/>For me rpg.net is a British pub. Most of the conversation is lightweight and folks tend to bore on about their particular hobby-horse, or discuss topics that they have no real knowledge of. It is however entertaining and the possibility of moments of drunken genius or humour keeps you going back. Occassionally you get the odd fight. It is relaxed, and if you believe that everyone else does not take it too seriously then there is no need for you to take yourself too seriously there either and you can have fun. My advice in rpg.net is to behave as if everyone was drunk.<br/><br/>The forge by contrast is a left bank coffee shop where everyone sits around discussing fine ideas and plotting revolution. It is intellectual in both the positive and negative connations of that. It is a place to go for stimulating debate rather than to unwind.<br/><br/>I am still trying to dedice on story games. My closest parallel so far is that it is the student bar where all the left-bank intellectuals go when they feel like going for a drink and letting the hair down, without feeling they are slumming it.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite>Is that typical of RPG.net moderation? Because, like the way Jared's thing was moderated, that's insanely heavy-handed. Not to mention smug.<br/></blockquote>
It is way too typical.  Since the thread is about explaining RPG.net..... <br/><br/>The mods there are iron-handed, petty dictators who get off on the small amount of power they have.  They're not there to run a forum dedicated to discussing RPGs.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By:  Ian Cooper</cite>For me rpg.net is a British pub.</blockquote>
If the pub were staffed by former members of Stalin's secret police, then yeah.  Start a bar fight and you get "disappeared."   Shit, it's not even whether you start a bar fight; it really boils down to whether you piss off a mod.  <br/><br/>Like with the Sorensen/Wick thing.  One of the mods there (I think it was MacLennan) posted to the effect that "We around here are embarrassed and pissed off about the whole thing.  If those involved apologize and beg us very nicely, we might be willing to ban for only a month or two instead of six months."  If it were about the smooth running of a community, instead of getting their jollies throwing around bans, the figurative "get down on your knees" and related implications wouldn't have been part of it.  And it wasn't even about keeping the community running smoothly; they felt like they had egg on their faces and had to Do Something.  <br/><br/>Those guys are like the fucking bad cops of the Internet.                        </div>

I mean seriously, "Stalinist Secret Police"? The RPGnet Moderators are trying to keep things relatively calm on a board with 30000+ Users and thousands of new posts per day. I'd really love to see how some of those throwing Pundit-style statements around would do a better job at it then the current moderation does.<br/><br/>I'm the first to say that there have been bad calls and I've had my quarrels with Cessna and the other mods myself, but some of the statements here are ridiculous.                        </div>

                            I used to be one of the Mods over there.  It's a crap job, and it's made harder by the stated goal of moderation.  That is, to be a place for welcoming and friendly discussion, full stop.<br/><br/>Not "about gaming", or "for gamers", though the organisation of the actual boards makes it clearly a gaming site.  Which means that productive gaming discussion can be sacrificed on the altar of being welcoming to everyone.  And nobody bats an eye at this, because the staff have honestly bought in to that set of priorities - friendly and welcoming for <i>everyone </i>- leading to all kinds of dumbass short-circuits that get bigger and bigger.<br/><br/>There are other criticisms, but that one strikes me as pretty central.                        </div>

                            Yah. I've had my dissatisfactions with the staff and the environment over there, but really, they're amazingly GOOD considering the Lowest Common Denominator nature of the community. If you want it to be "for everyone" and not focused, you kind of end up in the position of having to defend the comfort zone of the most know-nothing and reactionary portion of your audience.                        </div>

                            I have a great deal of sympathy for the RPG.Net mods, as I do for most people who are doing something entirely quixotic.  They're trying to do a noble thing.  They want to make a place that's welcoming.  Surely everyone is for that, in theory.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I also know that there are predictable feedbacks from their choices, for themselves and their community, and that it's going to bite them in the ass, HARD.<br/>
<br/>
Policing based on <i>hurt feelings</i> rather than on objective principles of what is right and what is wrong has a predictable feedback effect:  The more people expect to be protected from having their feelings hurt, the easier it becomes to hurt their feelings.  Any new offense has an effect that is conflated by your sense of outrage that your right to not be offended has been <i>betrayed</i>.  More and more things become offensive.  Less and less things become permissible.  Eventually, if the practice is followed with blind and unwavering conviction, <b>everything</b> is offensive and <b>nothing</b> is permissible.<br/>
<br/>
The mods will stop somewhere before then, and given time the community will rebound just fine.  I just worry that each step they take down their current path is going to make their eventual change of heart harder on them and nastier for the community.  I do hate to see people hurt for trying to do the right thing.                        </div>

                            I will withdraw the word "Stalinist" not on the grounds of harshness, but that it's demonstrably untrue.  Posters don't disappear quietly in the middle of the night, never to be heard from or spoken of again.  <br/><br/>RPG.net has never been a friendly or welcoming place in the entire time I was lurking and posting there (around five years all told).  They allow shitstorms to build, which inevitably devolve into personal attacks, which then require a mod to <span style="color: #FF0000;">jump in,</span> instead of dealing with the shitstorms and the people who cause them.  <br/><br/>And in my anti-mod rant I know I tarred some decent people with the wrong brush, and for that I issue a blanket apology.  But there are a few dick swingers who get off on having the power.  <br/><br/>Anyway, I will post no more on the topic of RPG.net moderation (or if I do it'll be in whispers).                        </div>

                            The other bit about Jared's banning was that the "if you come back and apologize" post (and the related posts about his and John's banning) were made in the Trouble Tickets section of RPGnet.  That section is only visible if you are logged in.  In other words, once banned from the site, he couldn't even read the RPGnet's moderator's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">terms of surrender</span> reaching out to him.<br/><br/>For reading the forums, I have to applaud the RPGnet community on the use of subject line tags.  If you're interested in Exalted, look for the subjects that read "[Exalted]". At least half of the active threads use these, which lets me skip over topics I'm not interested in.  Like Exalted.  Related to this is the subject rule:  If the topic subject is vague or a teaser (like "One thing I was thinking about..."), skip it.<br/><br/>The other incredibly handy thing about the forum software is the tooltip function.  If you mouse over the table cell with the subject title, the first sentence or two appears in the tooltip text.  If I'm not certain if I want to read a particular topic, I'll just hover the mouse and read part of the first post.  If it grabs me, right click to open in a new tab.                        </div>

                            One thing about RPGNet which steers my behavior rather poorly here:<br/><br/>At RPGNet, half the Open Gaming forum can change within minutes. There's a lot of traffic.<br/><br/>Here, traffic isn't nearly as intense: It takes a while for topics to fall off the page, and there's perhaps only 4-10 new topics a day, sometimes more sometimes less.<br/><br/>I. Love. That.  <br/><br/>It totally fits into what I want in a gaming website.  Not scrolling/talking so fast that if you don't respond quickly you're left out of the conversation. Not running so fast that you have to keep revisiting several times an hour/day to catch the latest posts.<br/><br/>However, because of my experiences from RPGNet, I want to revisit the site every hour; or refresh the front page every few minutes to check for new topics and replies. Or getting nervous when I don't see as many new topics per day as I would hope (in reality, the traffic is just perfect, but I've got that subconscious "...but at RPGNet there's new topics All The Time!" bug).<br/><br/>Instead of, like, chilling out, confident that I can get around to posting in threads whenever I want to, or just check a very few times per day. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Huh.  I don't think it's all <i>that</i> bad.  The only complaints I have are a consequence of it being so <i>big</i> - just too many monkeys - and same kind of thing you get with any sufficiently large group of people.  But I've never had a problem with the mods - they've always seemed pretty reasonable, albeit human (ref: Wick and Jared).<br/><br/>It's all about knowing what to expect.  I wouldn't try to have a proper back-and-forth coversation there (any more) because you're always going to end up talking to the loudest voice in the crowd.  So I try and stick to harmless contributions, let other people take care of the serious business and walk away in preference to getting bogged down in arguments.  And I get good, pretty stress-free mileage from the place. <br/><br/>I have nothing but respect for people like Levi and Tony LB that try to start and sustain real conversations, because they're better men than me.  That's something I just couldn't manage.  But I'm glad that rpg.net is there.                        </div>

                            There are many good things about rpg.net, one of the best is this post, presented unedited for reasons that will soon become obvious:<br/>
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
I am an angry GM. there I've said it. I am angry because EVERYONE loves whining on and on about how lousy thier GM is. There are so many threads on this board alone about how lousy this DM and that storyteller, and that ref all are. Well what I can say is that I am a lousy GM too. I am lousy after years and years of players that all want to play nipplehead the amazing flying cheeto thief from the purple planet of crouton manufacturing. I am lousy after years and years of Laboring for weeks over a campaign only to have everyone show up and read comic books while I try to describe the setting. I am lousy after taking time to ask all the players what they want to see out of my campaign and trying my hardest to work it in only to have them kill thier character off anyway so that they can play a human.pumpkin hybrid whose genitals smell vaguely of partially digested garfield slippers.  Lots of people like to talk about how bad<br/>
some player is in thier game.  Well let me tell you as painfull as it is to PC alongside them its even worse to try and run a game for them. While they are busy trying to use thier sneak skill while riding a motorcycle through a paine of glass, we are trying to rack our brains figuring out the ins and outs of all the mornic crap they want to do.  We're the ones who have to deal with the politicing of kicking someone out of the game, cause even though he is everyone's friend, his time travelling viking berserker that farts out explosive talking ducks simply does not fit into the Black Ops game we are running. We are the ones who get told that the game we have been planning for 8 months "sucks fat donkey balls". And most of all we are the ones that have to look a player dead in the face and say that his latest ludicrous character is "just fine" when really you want to smack him in the face for making another quadrepalegic dwarven cleric of the god of butter.  When we say "I am planning a high powered game" and someone makes a stablehand who has all his skills in manure shoveling, it ticks us off.  When we point out 760 possible solutions to the problem at<br/>
hand, and you still decide that the plan you have already tried for the past 9 hours of real time involving a granola bar and hyperactive rabbit is still what you are going to try again, that ticks us off too.  The reason lots of us have "pet NPCs" is because we need someone there to snatch away the granola bar, stomp the crud out of the rabbit and kick your butt through that big door labeled "EXIT OF THE DUNGEON". The reason<br/>
lots of us dont plan anything in advance is because we know we will be mocked for whatever we think of anyway. And then the few times we do get good players we have become so jaded with "Benny Beanfart the magnificent" that we just fall into the same routine we have doen for the past 8 years, which is sit behind a litle screen and draw stick men while we wait for the players o shout something vaguely coherent at us so that we may react semi-appropriately.                        </div>

Robert, are you criticizing any use of the IL, or just hasty use?<br><br>RPG.net is one of the few forums where I have anyone on my IL, and I only have eight people on it (seems small to me, I dunno). All of these are people who have repeatedly ruined threads I've been in, been directly offensive to me, and, most likely, have done so in more venues than just the RPG.net forums. I find it very useful to IL them because it helps to stop me from engaging them in what I know will be a useless waste of my time and energy.<br><br>Mind you, you can still view the posts of people on your IL, you just need to click the "View Post" link. Honestly, a lot of the time I do anyway, but it serves a reminder to me that a) what I'm about to read will likely piss me off, and 2) replying to them will inevitably end badly.<br><br/>Anyway...<br/><br/>I used to spend a lot of time on RPG.net as I made the sift from Usenet in the late '90s and early '00s. I even posted reviews. Eventually, though, the discussion was so consistently hostile, unproductive, and voluminous that I just gave up.* I still pop by to check Open every once in a while, and I look for reviews and articles every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; Shannon's "A Brief Hsitory..." essays have been awesome. Nonetheless, I much prefer to spend my time here, at ENworld, or surfing the RPG blogosphere.<br/><br/>*This is why I haven't much stomach for theRPGsite, either.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hello, all.  I just discovered this site today when Andy told me about it.<br/><br/>I'm still a regular reader of RPG.net, but certainly not a regular poster.  The trick, I find, is to sit down and figure out what it is you care about and then focus on that.  If you try to follow every thread, you will go insane.  Can't be done, even sticking to Tabletop Open.  And then, develop a sense of which posters match up with your own preferences and expectations, and those that do not.  For instance, a comment from Kiero, RSC, or cjh will likely be of no use to me, because they do not think like I do and do not play for the same reasons I do.  I post rarely because even though my exposure to RPGs has spanned many years, my density of play was quite light over that time and so I haven't developed a lot of wisdom to share with people.  I prefer to read and learn.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd advise using the ignore list sparingly.  My sig there used to say that my ignore list was everyone who published their ignore list in their sig.  It was entirely tongue-in-cheek, as I've never added anyone to it, even though there are posters who tempt me a couple of times a week to do so.<br/><br/>As for moderation, I agree with some of the conclustion from <a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2829" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> at TheRPGSite.  They have brought a lot of hardship on themselves by the direction they've taken the site's tone.  They seem to have decided that no one should ever be offended by anything ever, and that' just asking for trouble.                        </div>

<p>kbob's reply about ignore lists illustrates another point that's important about really big forums in general; it's useless to expect people to read and understand what you meant and respond to it; they are much more likely to use keywords from your posts to make their own unrelated points.</p>

RSC is on my IL, not only based on posts at RPG.net, but encounters going years back on Usenet. Maybe I'm close-minded, but IL'ing folks like him just helps maintain my peace of mind.                        </div>

Mostly because the poster in question seemed to be interested in exploring different approaches to gaming, then ended up IL'ing most of the people working on exactly that.<br/><br/>That's nothing but self-defeating behavior there.                        </div>

Shreyas is so right. All that purple and white is clearly for <b>roll</b>-players, not role-players.                        </div>

                            As far as ILs go: Yeah, they can be used hasty or as an excuse for being lazy or whatever, but IME it seldomly is. ... Or at least I don't think I use it that way. ^_^<br/><br/>After all, adding somebody to the ignore list is work, because it's generally at least three clicks away and then you have to type the name in manually. As I generally have more interesting things to do, the only people who end up on my ignore list are those who constantly and repeatedly go on my nerves and make my reading experience much, much worse. I don't think I've ever had more then 8 people on my ignore list at a time and six of them have since stopped posting or have been banned. (I think i still have the Pundit on my IL, even though he's been banned for a long while now.) So at any time, there are probably only one or two obnoxious bastards that are actually active users on my IL, and I can live with that. And quite often I find myself agreeing with some who used to be assholes and have since calmed down, so I take them off.<br/><br/>*shrug*<br/><br/>Anyway, I've found the IL usefull for the one or two assholes that make reading RPGnet an ugly experience, but to use it for anything else isn't worth the effort. <br/><br/>BTW, that reminds me of something: Because RPGnet is sooooooo big, it has more or less any sort of user you care to think of, meaning there will always be somebody who really, really rubs you the wrong way. And sometimes, it's too easy to point at this guy and say "See, that's just how RPGnet is and why it sucks." and take him as an example of a widespread trend, when he's really just one of a few obnoxious users among thousand normal ones.                        </div>

                            I got moderated because I had a hate-filled quote from Hunter S. Thompson about people who voted for George W. Bush ("fuck those flag-sucking," etc.), and they felt that it might be taken as a personal attack on individuals.  I tried to argue that an attack can't be personal if it's not directed at a person, but they weren't buying it.  They tried to get me to volunteer to remove it, and I respectfully refused to volunteer.  I told them that I would remove it if told I had to, but I would not do so voluntarily.  So they made me.  Kinda asinine but nothing that bothers me too much.<br/><br/>As for how I use RPG.net, I was recently spending lots and lots of time on the Other Media forum, but as that got more and more negative about shows I love, I decided I didn't want to deal with the active dampening of my enthusiasm all day.  Now if I'm bored at work I'll skim the forums and see what's going on.<br/><br/>As I move toward promoting Misspent Youth I plan on making myself a more active and actively helpful member.                        </div>

                            RPG.net: Thousands of geeks screaming in unison.<br/>
<br/>
I don't bother anymore. Picking out the signal from the noise takes too much energy. So many people read a thread, throw their opinion into the mix without even paying attention to what other people are saying, and move on.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like what I'm doing right now. ;)                        </div>
