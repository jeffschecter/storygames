With skill and luck, you can create situations where your opponent has to overwhelmingly focus on <i>reacting</i> instead of acting. Or you just get the drop on them.<br/><br/>But I don't think that the initiative paradigms I'm familiar with \u2013 individual initiative, group initiative, reverse declaration, and free-and-clear \u2013 address this element of a confrontation. AW can model this very nicely, but not in a formalized way.<br/><br/>One game mechanic that I've been mentally playing around with assumes an initiative queue that is determined at the beginning of the conflict. The character at the top of the queue is the one that gets to act first (although they can choose to delay and possibly interrupt), and taking action moves a character to the bottom of the queue. When someone takes direct action against you and you have the opportunity to react, you can choose whether you react or not. If you do react, you get to ameliorate whatever consequences your opponent's action would cause for you, but then your position in the initiative queue drops directly below theirs; i.e. you're now last and they're one position above you. If you don't react, you take the normal consequences but get to keep your initiative position (assuming that the consequences don't affect it). Sort of like you're "acting under fire" if you choose not to react.<br/><br/>Thoughts on this idea? Thoughts on existing game systems that might be of interest here?

Whoever declares action first starts the combat and has the first initiative. After the first actor the initiative goes around the table in sitting order. The GM takes initiative at his turn, but only for the single most appropriate NPC at a time. This regular initiative process is disrupted by the fact that characters have a right to "respond" to actions pertaining to them (an enemy attacking them, or attempting to flee, or whatever); if they do, the initiative jumps to that player, and then continues around the table normally. The reason for why you may not wish to react every time you could is that every action carries an inherent risk of loss, and the more you act without reorienting yourself (only possible with non-responding actions at your naturally occurring initiative), the more likely such failure becomes. The game also assumes pretty heavy "passive presence" (that is, the characters do all sorts of things by assumption, without the player needing to actively declare e.g. defending oneself and continuing to engage in melee) for the characters, so a player in a winning position does not necessarily need to take actions constantly to continue pressing their advantage.<br/><br/>My second example is supposed to be a modestly realistic and tactically interesting reinterpretation of the D&amp;D initiative system, particularly 3rd edition: every character begins combat by rolling initiative with a d20+Wits attribute check, and initiative is counted down to determine who gets a turn when. Monsters and NPCs have their own scores. The core conceit is intentionally familiar, but the concept of "initiative spending" takes this to a new direction: the Init score is interpreted as an active measure of personal combat awareness for an individual character, and therefore characters spend points from it during combat to activate various effects. An active defense (as opposed to relying on your static AC) such as a dodge or block cost a few points, reacting to orders by someone else at a different initiative does as well, and so on. A character 10 or more points up on an enemy can spend 10 points of initiative to outright take a second action; a 3rd ed. style opportunity attack costs 5 initiative. Characters can take combat actions to confuse and confound each other, damaging each other's initiative scores in addition to their hitpoints. You only get one normal action per round, even if your initiative drops during it so "your number" comes up multiple times, of course. It is very well possible to drop to negative initiative, which inflicts confusion, hesitation and such difficulties on the character; it is therefore important for characters to take the time to reorient themselves occasionally during combat, rerolling their initiative scores and observing their environment. In general your initiative level determines how detailed tactical information the GM gives you, so whether you're at &lt;10 or 20+ Init at a given time may come to matter in subtle ways as your character miscounts the number of enemies or whatever. What I like about this system in practice is how it retains the simplicity of D&amp;D's answers to "who hits first" and "whose turn is it", while also fully supporting the idea of real-world initiative that you mentioned: superior initiative enables characters, and inferior initiative disables them, all in flexible ways that are easy to add to and expand on further.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455226/#Comment_455226" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-23T23:42:44+00:00" title="July 23, 2016 11:42PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like an initiative system with some tactical choice and trade-offs for acting sooner vs. acting more deliberately.

Characters act in the order of the strength of their bids (ties roll their bid dice, plus relevant bonuses.)<br/><br/>So, bid low: have more bonus dice to use during your turn.

Maybe everyone on their feet can try to dodge a melee attack, everyone with a melee weapon of their own can try to block it, and someone with the right training could try to turn aside the attack while grappling the defender in the process (think jujutsu and the martial arts derived from it). For a character that can do all three, there would likely be different chances of success and different potential outcomes for each type of reaction.<br/><br/>And yes, there's almost always some reaction, in the general sense of the word. You might hesitate and then grit your teeth as you decide to take a potential sword thrust in order to make one yourself, but for the purposes of this system, "react" is when you forfeit your initiative by defensively addressing the threat. (Thinking as I write this: does it necessarily have to be defensive?)\n<blockquote>So, overall, I guess I do like the basic idea, but I'd want to see it plugged into the right sort of system which (a) keeps its choices meaningful and (b) applies fictional developments that I find fun/sensible to all its possibilities.</blockquote>\nYes, as Eero also pointed out, the other aspects of the system would need to be defined in order to evaluate the idea in context.

It sounds interesting, but I've no idea how I would design such a thing.\n<blockquote>That's what initiative is supposed to do.</blockquote>\nFor sure! And it's too bad that such an interesting concept is boiled down to a static "who goes first?" so often. You and David both seem to be inclined toward a simultaneous-action system, but I'm not sure how I would model something like "a fighter on your tail" in such. In the queue-based system I described, the fighter on the other's tail would have the opportunity to fire, disengage, etc, and the other fighter would have to take evasive action (maneuvers, flares) against being fired on or suffer the consequences. In this case the fiction is such that it makes no sense for the fighter being tailed to be able to counterattack directly after, but perhaps making a riskier maneuver under fire would place them in a better position for the next exchange.<br/><br/>Here's where I pay my respects to air-to-air combat as the origin of the OODA loop concept, which has definitely influenced (or at least organized) my thinking on these sorts of things.\n<blockquote>However, how are you determining when you have the opportunity to react? Can you react against someone after you've already acted?</blockquote>\nIt would be defined by the fictional positioning and not the rules per se. You don't have the opportunity to react to a sniper taking a shot at you when you least expect it, but if you live past the first shot you can "react" by taking cover or "act" by trying to shoot back or continuing to pursue another objective. Note that in this case it becomes clear that action/reaction can be a bit abstract; you don't really decide to take cover or not every time the sniper fires, but as long as the sniper is firing at you, some of your options may have negative consequences.<br/><br/>And yes, you can react against someone after you've already acted. The queue system means that there are no "rounds", so before long everyone has probably "already acted" and will remain that way for the rest of the conflict.\n<blockquote>The model I've worked with is something of the inverse of yours, where you must successfully counter your opponent's action in some way before attempting your own. And it gets complicated outside of combat where intentions go beyond simply damaging your opponent.</blockquote>\nYeah, this concept definitely isn't limited to combat, but combat is the only place where a lot of roleplaying systems have a mechanical concept of this sort of thing, so I wanted to highlight it as the main example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455239/#Comment_455239" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T02:10:08+00:00" title="July 25, 2016  2:10AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2016 2:11AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a pretty interesting topic.<br/><br/>Traditionally, "initiative rules" simply indicate what order actors make their "moves".<br/><br/>However, there are many other important factors in "initiative". I'll try listing a few here:<br/><br/>1. When is it your turn (you, the player) to make a meaningful decision?<br/><br/>* Traditionally, this coincides with the turn order. When it's your turn, you decide what you're doing. Of course, this is not the only possibility.<br/>* We can have systems where all actions must be decided before initiative is determined at all.<br/>* We can have systems where determining *what* you do is coupled to *when* you do it in other ways. For instance, the "reverse declaration" method, where the last person to act must announce their action first.<br/>* We could also have a system where you can choose to act first in exchange for limiting your options. Yes, you get to react right away... BUT you don't get to choose HOW you react, or your choices are limited.<br/><br/>I designed a system like that once but never playtested it. In high stress situations, you could hesitate or you could carry out one "trained" action. Your range of "trained" actions was very limited; experience and skill meant you could have a larger list of possible actions to choose from than your opponent.<br/><br/>2. When does your <i>character</i> have a chance to make a move?<br/><br/>* As above, this does not have to be linked to your choices as a player. Why not explore some other possibilities? Perhaps we know that your character acts first, but you get to decide what exactly it was they did after the others' actions are known?<br/><br/>Or what if decide on our actions in a certain order, but all our *characters* then act simultaneously? <br/><br/>In that case, initiative really means better "move" selection - the loser has to do so blind, whereas the winner can make a well-informed decision.<br/><br/>Eero makes a really important and usually overlooked distinction on this next point:<br/><br/>To what extent is a character active or passive throughout the process? The game assumes certain things about their actions throughout the process:<br/><br/>3. What is your character doing when it's not "their turn"?<br/><br/>Some games assume that everyone is actively participating all the time; in other games, your character might as well be standing still (shocked, stunned, hesitating) until your turn comes up.<br/><br/>That implies very different processes, both for determining what happens in-fiction and what happens at the table.<br/><br/>Give a thought as to what characters are assumed to be doing during other players' turns or declarations!<br/><br/>Each little step in your process implies things about what's happening "on screen" and how the characters are behaving when we aren't consciously manipulating or describing their actions. (The "attack of opportunity" is a perfect example of this.)<br/><br/>4. Which actors are initiating the action, and which are responding to it?<br/><br/>This can also be uncoupled from the other options. Perhaps you have the initiative, so I can only choose defensive or reactive "moves"... but, as the player, I still make that choice first.<br/><br/>I might need to declare that I'm putting up my sword and moving over to block you from getting to the door, for instance, even before your turn comes up!<br/><br/>5. Which actors are limiting the options of other actors?<br/><br/>Sometimes "having the initiative" means that I can dictate the terms of the confrontation, limit the movement of my opponent, or press an advantage.<br/><br/>6. When I make my choices, as player or character, which other actors' choices do I know?<br/><br/>We can play with chronology here in various ways. Perhaps I can win a chance to act first in exchange for *ignoring whatever is going on around me*. That has some interesting implications; in this model, the most careful and thoughtful actor has the best information, but therefore acts last. (The opposite of the "reverse declaration" method I mention above.) The least informed, most reckless, acts first, but is making their choices blind (or practically blind).<br/><br/>7. Are the number and sequence of "moves" intended to be balanced or equivalent?<br/><br/>In most D&amp;D-derived games, there is an attempt to give each actor an equal number of opportunities.<br/><br/>There is no need for this to be the case, of course. Perhaps seizing the initiative means I get to act, act, and act some more. My opponent doesn't get a chance to act at all, unless they can reverse the situation and seize the initiative themselves.<br/><br/>Or perhaps we wish to play with the dramatic balance of actions. (For instance, I've seen games where a group of PCs attack a monster, and the sequence of turns is PC 1 - GM - PC 2 - GM - PC 3 - GM - PC 4 - GM, and so on. In practice, from a dramatic perspective this feels like a good "back-and-forth". However, it means that the monster is taking four times as many actions in a given period of time as each PC. This could vary based on the number of actors involved instead of being based in any kind of simulation or "game balance".)<br/><br/>8. Does anyone have the option to decide who acts and when during the process itself?<br/><br/>Sometimes the "initiative" is a static process we go through; in other rules, it is something we manipulate during the actual play - in this variety, my "turn" might not be about doing something as a character, but it might be about making sure that I delay the opponent's move long enough for my friend to get in their own move...<br/><br/>Hopefully that gives someone some inspiration. It's off the top of my head, so I'd love to hear what other variables can be uncovered and then mutated...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455240/#Comment_455240" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T03:18:27+00:00" title="July 25, 2016  3:18AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2016 3:19AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You and David both seem to be inclined toward a simultaneous-action system, but I'm not sure how I would model something like "a fighter on your tail" in such. In the queue-based system I described, the fighter on the other's tail would have the opportunity to fire, disengage, etc, and the other fighter would have to take evasive action (maneuvers, flares) against being fired on or suffer the consequences.</blockquote>The big change with simultaneity is that the pursued fighter has to choose maneuvers, flares, etc. on the <i>assumption</i> that the pursuing fighter will continue to pursue/attack.  If the pursuing fighter's strategy is to instead make their target waste fuel so they'll eventually be forced to land (so I can steal your ship's secrets without blowing it up first, mwahahaha), then you do your power roll just as I back off to cut off your obvious escape route, and maybe we're both a bit surprised.  <br/><br/>I look at it this way: fictionally, either side can change their choice of action at <i>any</i> time; what the rules tell us is <i>when we look</i> for choices of actions.<br/><br/>If you look at both combatants simultaneously, they're still each reacting to the last thing the other guy did, they're just no longer doing it one at a time.<br/><br/>I think I can change my mind faster than you can react to me changing my mind, so I actually like simultaneity fictionally too -- just because I start shooting at you doesn't mean I must continue to shoot at you while you react to that.<br/><br/>Anyway, dunno if I answered your question clearly or not.  The more obvious example is where two warriors both swing their swords full force at each other because they both decided that was their strategy at the same moment.

Here's an alternate idea, though: <b>every time anyone declares an action, their opponent rolls to parse that action quickly enough to not suffer its effects before reacting</b>.  Then the other player rolls to parse <i>that</i> reaction, and so on and so on.  First person to fail the parsing roll does not get to make a new decision in reaction to the previous player's action until after the previous player's action has kicked in.<br/><br/>I dunno if that would make fictional sense, as some actions are way faster/slower and more/less obvious than others, but if it was fun and worth the bother, such variables could always be factored in as mods to parsing rolls.\n<blockquote>The more obvious example is where two warriors both swing their swords full force at each other because they both decided that was their strategy at the same moment.  So they both injure each other at once.</blockquote>\nTwo warriors both slicing each other is an interesting one, actually, because the blow that lands a millisecond earlier might impact the strength or accuracy of the blow that lands a millisecond later, so this can be a factor in resolution.  It's certainly faster than the speed of decision-making, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455244/#Comment_455244" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T03:41:13+00:00" title="July 25, 2016  3:41AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2016 3:41AM by jangler.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Some games assume that everyone is actively participating all the time; in other games, your character might as well be standing still (shocked, stunned, hesitating) until your turn comes up.</blockquote>\nYeah, Eero's point about "passive presence" is interesting to me in that characters are assumed to continue to <i>fight</i> by default, and not just defend. I think I remember a post Eero made somewhere about how occasionally his combats resolve as: "OK, you guys have the advantage, so unless you want to try anything decisive we'll assume that you won by attrition."<br/><br/>The way I picture D&amp;D fights is that for most of the 6 seconds that make up a round of combat, characters are jockeying for momentary advantage in order to be able to make a decent attack without leaving themselves open \u2013 and maybe taking a potshot at someone who does leave themselves open.<br/><br/>\u2026 except in LotFP, which makes it quite clear that when someone is casting a spell in combat, it requires the entirety of their focus for the whole round.\n<blockquote>Anyway, dunno if I answered your question clearly or not.</blockquote>\nYes, thank you! It's interesting in a very different way, and definitely "realistic"\u2026 but I'm hesitant to endorse it because of my experience with "place your actions face-down and then flip" board games, and my experience with two people trying to pass each other in a hallway but both moving "out of the way" in the same direction. I like the action/reaction paradigm and the assumption that characters do reasonable but non-decisive things from moment to moment otherwise, since I think that lets the focus "zoom in" on the most interesting parts of the conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455246/#Comment_455246" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T06:51:02+00:00" title="July 25, 2016  6:51AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not read the thread yet - posting in a rush - so forgive me if this has already come up but have you considered a turn order based on action?<br/><br/>I recall there was a Dr Who RPG that always let talking happen first, which seems fitting.

That can be a very robust and simple "initiative" rule, and allows us to process actions logically, as they come up in combat. Sometimes you could roll for the ordering of actions, as well - "Ok, you kicked open the door, while you cast your spell... oh, hang on - we need to know which happened first. Let's roll for that."<br/><br/>(Also, I can't remember if I mentioned this in my breakdown post, above, but it's always possible to separate in-fiction ordering from at-the-table ordering. In other words, we go around the table and resolve various actions, but we accept that we might not be seeing things in the order they're actually happening. Movies are sometimes filmed this way - a character does something, and then we cut away to another perspective, where someone else is doing something else at the same time, or "meanwhile". For instance, we resolve one character getting overpowered by an opposing combatant, and then we resolve her ally defusing the bomb and opening the door... but we don't have to know the exact chronology involved unless they're somehow opposing each other or relying on each other's "moves" for their own.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455267/#Comment_455267" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T20:50:31+00:00" title="July 25, 2016  8:50PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I especially like where you were going with the idea that Actors and Reactors have different action options available based on their current state as Actor or Reactor.

And you're absolutely right, it's more interesting if there are options for the Defender beyond "defend or deal with it" \u2013 I think my jujutsu example from earlier in the thread could be a situation where a character can have their initiative and eat it too (or at least not drop below the Aggressor's initiative) by making a good roll on some sort of applicable ability.

Although I'd say that once the dagger user has made it past the effective range of the spear, they should have initiative instead! So there are opportunities to change things up via this method. Similarly, a prepared archer would have the opportunity to fire on a swordsman 30 feet away before the swordsman can close the distance, but once the swordsman is infighting, attacking with bow fire gets very difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455268/#Comment_455268" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-25T21:01:04+00:00" title="July 25, 2016  9:01PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2016 9:01PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But it should be <i>hard</i> to do that sort of thing, because otherwise having the initiative isn't as valuable anymore.</blockquote>Yeah!

People don't actually run around attacking first this guy and then that guy; if you're engaged with an opponent, turning away for just a fraction of a second is really dangerous. If there are more opponents on one side than on the other, one or more will have to take on multiple opponents by themselves. That's pretty hard, and if you're not super skilled, you might have to just try to survive long enough for one of your friends to finish their guy and come help you.<br/><br/>Next, each duel rolls some dice to determine who gets the initialtive. That side is the attacker. The attacker is the only one who can attack! The only thing the defender can do is to keep defending and try to gain the initiative, unless they have some sweet special abilities. This gives rise to a back-and-forth between the opponents and jockeying for position, getting the initiative and using it to deal some damage. As an attacker, you can push on, making sure to keep the initiative at all costs, but that might tire you out. Or you can make one powerful attack, knowing that you'll probably lose the initiative. As a defender, you can take chances and cut corners in order to take back the initiative, or you can be conservative and careful and hope the attacker will make a mistake before you do. And so on.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the above was accompanied by a bazillion die rolls, but I think there's a lot of merit in the system and it could be made fun. And for a dogfight, it could work, too. If someone's on your tail, all you can do is try to shake them and gain the initiative; you can't attack until it's YOU who have THEM in your sights.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455371/#Comment_455371" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-29T07:26:27+00:00" title="July 29, 2016  7:26AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The attacker is the only one who can attack!

Without your guard up, a single good hit will down you. With your guard up, your opponent simply decreases your momentum or increases hers by striking you. There is just one momentum value between two combatants but different moves are possible if you have the momentum or don't. With enough momentum, you can break a guard just by striking; without, you must use feints and trickery.<br/><br/>It strikes me that during combat there is something we call "momentum" which has a lot in common with those things which we call "initiative", and thinking about this question in terms of momentum rather than initiative may be fruitful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455372/#Comment_455372" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-29T07:44:02+00:00" title="July 29, 2016  7:44AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, initiative is like when you're playing Connect Four, and you can keep forcing your oponent to react to your moves just to keep you from winning.

I don't think there's anything that's necessarily very complex in the idea, it was just a part of a very complex system. It can probably be done easily with one roll to determine attacker in the first round, then a simple condition to how to take over initiative. As a general rule, if the attacker rolls badly or the defender well, flip initiative.<br/><br/>You can probably do it within a resource or risk management paradigm to spice things up. Take a chance as a defender in order to gain initiative. Make an extra powerful attack as an attacker, but definitely lose initiative, and so on.

The design, of course, would be set up so that if you tried to act too often, you'd quickly self-destruct, so players would have to pick their moments carefully.<br/><br/>I suppose this could be accomplished via something as simple as:<br/><br/>* You start with a pool of dice or points.<br/>* Taking action costs you some number of those.<br/>* You regain dice/points when OTHER people act.<br/>* You decide when to take your next turn; it's up to you.<br/><br/>Then all you need is a rule for who goes first when multiple parties want to act at the same time. It could be a roll-off, a bidding war (with the dice/points), or it could be systematic (e.g. such and such type of action always trumps that other type of action, so you just look up who's doing what when it comes up and that tells you who "goes first").<br/><br/>It could potentially handle "initiative" (in the sense of momentum), as well. Let's say taking actions *doesn't* cost you points (or not many), but the defender doesn't get to do anything but react until they store up X points/dice, and then they can use that to "take over initiative".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455498/#Comment_455498" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-05T02:22:58+00:00" title="August  5, 2016  2:22AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>* You regain dice/points when OTHER people act.</blockquote>\nThis has interesting implications.

Unless you specify that someone attacking you (etc) is not giving you any action fuel.

Such cards are used for simultaneous Action declaration.<br/><br/>Once all combatants' Actions are revealed, we roll dice pools (which are derived from something other than just the Action being attempted) to see which ones succeed.  Some Actions are more difficult than others, requiring rolls of 5+ or 6+ instead of 4+ to register successes.<br/><br/>Am I right?<br/><br/>If so, then I like your menu of options quite a lot!

In the fiction, everyone and the NPCs are acting/reacting at the same time, though we are using narrative to describe things one at a time. A player does things that require more than one roll? That's good! This gives the GM more chances to act. <br/><br/>Does it seem feasible for the PC to do those things in quick sucession? Then it's okey, let the player roll twice. Does it look like another PC could act before the second task is tried? Id it does, we put that action on hold and as the next player for their input. Did we lost count of who acted and who not? Okey, who hasn't acted yet goes first. Still have no idea of what to do? Then let's describe that player which openings have their partners created. No idea yet? You can prepare your action until you're ready and take measures while you're at it, and so we get to the next player.<br/><br/>It's borderline chaotic, but in a nice way. We're actually saving a lot of time by not waiting for each player to decide their action. When they are inspired to try anything, they raise their hand or otherwise indicate they are ready and if there's more than one, the GM decides who goes next based on either the fiction or going clockwise around the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455510/#Comment_455510" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-06T07:08:26+00:00" title="August  6, 2016  7:08AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Am I right?</blockquote>\nYup, that's pretty much what I was suggesting.\n<blockquote>If I were going for realism over gameplay, I think I'd make Counterattack at least as difficult as Break Through, and I'd consider making Push Back 6+.

I think there's some of that in Simon's examples, but here's one that's maybe clearer:<br/><br/>Roll with max. dice/points = "Insta-kill" attempt option available<br/>Roll with any dice/points = "inflict Disadvantage" option available<br/>1 Disadvantage means nothing; 2 Disadvantages curtails 1 Action option; 3 Disadvantages curtails 3 Action options<br/><br/>So the longer you spend "charging up", the more your opponent can incrementally push you into a bad spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455699/#Comment_455699" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-20T02:50:26+00:00" title="August 20, 2016  2:50AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm tempted to poke more at Simon's idea, but first I feel like I should ask if it actually serves any of what you're looking for, <a href="/forums/profile/jangler">@jangler</a>.</blockquote>\nWell, the thread's just called "Better initiative/turn systems" so anything under that umbrella is fair game IMO. I understand Simon's idea but I don't really understand the implications, so maybe poking at it more would be a good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
