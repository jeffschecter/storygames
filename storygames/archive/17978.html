I need fantasy stories and fairy tales of the weird (or more aptly, but in its archaic usage: wyrd), strange and grotesque. I'm mining for a few things specifically:<br/><br/>1) Meandering tales of apprenticeship and servitude, the events of which are marked as much by strange chance as an unseen internal logic. <i>Spirited Away</i> and <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> are gold standards, here, as is <i>The Shadow of the Torturer</i> (less so the rest of the books). I'm planning on re-reading the <i>Gormenghast</i> books for Steerpike's slow rise to power and influence, as well. <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i> are over-explained and lack wonder, and are thus useless to me, unless somebody can explain why they're worth another look. I can't help but keep thinking of Disney's <i>The Sorcerer's Apprentice</i> from <i>Fantasia</i>, though. I find the eerie unspoken relationship between the sorcerer and the apprentice to be fascinating.<br/><br/>2) Fantastic settings. The Bog of Eternal Stench from <i>The Labyrinth</i>. The Botanical Gardens in <i>The Shadow of the Torturer</i>. The Zone from <i>Stalker</i>. Pretty much everything from <i>The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath</i>, <i>Palimpsest</i>,<i> Gormenghast</i>, and <i>Invisible Cities</i>. They're rich, vibrant, and surreal. A number of them are impossible to build or represent, and can only exist in the imagination. If there is magic, its largely a magic of place.<br/><br/>3) Beasts, creatures, and bizarre characters. <i>Spirited Away</i> is awesome again, as are the creatures from <i>Palimpsest</i>. <i> Gormenghast</i> is glorious. I keep returning to the figure of Baba Yaga. <i>The Labyrinth</i> is great, but for some reason I'm less compelled by <i>The Dark Crystal</i>. In <i>The Book of the New Sun</i> there is a creature called an Alzabo that, when it has eaten human flesh, can for a short time speak and act as humans do. The creatures I'm compelled by are are defined more by their behaviours and social structure than their appearance. That's important - there are no beasts that you can't interact with socially, nothing whose only purpose is to be combated. If they're dangerous, its a subtle danger. If they're magical, it has rhyme, but no reason, or a reason that has been forgotten.<br/><br/>Much obliged!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406407/#Comment_406407" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T14:44:12+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  2:44PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you like weird not fully explained monsters try out  the Poetic Edda by Snorri Sturlison.

The Nightbound Lands duology by Trent Jamieson gives us a zone of darkness and heat called the roil that changes everything it covers.  And for monsters and an evocative setting you can't beat William Hope Hodgson's The Night Land.  It's the distant future, the sun has gone out, and all of humanity lives in one giant pyramid, beseiged by forces that will devore their souls if they get a chance (and while it may be heresy, if you're going to read the actual book, I'd recommend the rewrite by James Stoddard -- I've read both, and I think his version is a better read).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406444/#Comment_406444" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-17T08:17:14+00:00" title="February 17, 2013  8:17AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2013 8:19AM by kurisu.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you like Calvino's Invisible Cities, you should check out Borges's Book of Imaginary Beings.

MatrixGamer, I am not sure what you mean by "contrived" but they are not like Harry Potter at all. Also, a really wonderful book is East of the Sun, West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North.

I'd forgotten about The Neverending Story and Hans Christian Anderson! Fantastic stuff. I think Paul is right, as well - the species of strangeness I'm looking for works emotively. The uncanny!<br/><br/>I'm pretty familiar with The Brother's Grimm, and they're not quite what I'm looking for. The nationalism &amp; moralism make them a poor fit. There are exceptions, though. Iron John, for example, would make for great source material, but would have to be drifted pretty significantly from its origin (not to mention the unfortunate masculinist connotations). With that in mind, it's delightful to see the origins of Miyazaki's creatures, and the transformation they've undergone from their folkloric roots. It suggests a procedure to selectively modifying the traits, tone, behaviour, and social interactions of a creature.<br/><br/>In thinking about this, I came up with an idea for a witch, just to try out a process. Typically, it seems like the most unsettling characters have a single modified or exaggerated physical trait. A woman with an enormous head, a bird with a woman's head, a dog with chicken's feet. Too many and they become an unrecognizable mound of images that is fantastic rather than uncanny. So, I imagine an old woman with too many fingers, so long as to be able to stretch across the room, many knuckled, bending this way and that. But its not what she looks like that matters as much as what she does. Like the ghosts of those who drown in Japanese folklore, who paddle up alongside boats and ask for ladle or bucket, and then use it to scoop water into your boat and sink it. So, this woman sits at home in her rocking chair, weaving an enormous shawl that spills out into the forest. Her fingers occasionally creep far from her home, searching for more fibres to weave into the shawl. In play, you'll get to answer the questions of: who or what is she weaving for? Why is she weaving? What kinds of fibre is she searching for (your hair? your clothes? your souls?) What is her relationship with the other NPCs in the world? What does she want with the player characters?<br/><br/>Keep them coming!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406506/#Comment_406506" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T07:44:49+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  7:44AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the more fantastical stories in Stan Sakai's USAGI YOJIMBO might fit the bill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406510/#Comment_406510" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T09:10:30+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  9:10AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, I imagine an old woman with too many fingers, so long as to be able to stretch across the room, many knuckled, bending this way and that.</blockquote>\nLove it!

There's weirdness in there, big time, which was later excised by rewrites who wanted to clear up the morality of the stories and make them a better fit for children.<br/><br/>(For instance, in old versions of the Cinderella story, the poor girl chops off part of her feet to fit into those shoes. This makes a lot more sense if you think about it: how likely is it that no one else in the whole kingdom had her same shoe size? If she mutilated her feet, it would make sense that the prince could travel the land and find the one person who could fit into those shoes, specifically. That's why they are "glass slippers" in later version of the story: so no one could bring that detail back into the story, since, after all, in glass slippers the wounds would be clearly visible.

He was the only person that could write that way and no one has been able to emulate him (though Lovecraft loved to try)<br/><br/>Though the writing was underwhelming, a Voyage to Arcturus had fantastic imagination.<br/><br/>Clark Ashton Smith did the weird and grotesque with aplomb.<br/><br/>Astrid Lindgren's Ronia, the Robber's Daughter is some of the best modern fairy tale writing.<br/><br/>M. John Harrison's In Viriconium is a wonderful story and the most applicable to your purposes of all his Viriconium stories. A wonderful setting, though the impact is somewhat lessened if you have not read all of the stories to understand what he does with it.<br/><br/>The novel Howl's Moving Castle is vastly better than the movie adaptation which you seem to be referring to. I felt that the movie was bereft of all imagination or originality, just a tired retreading of old ground.<br/><br/>Kiki's Delivery Service however worked wonderfully as an adaptation and definitely fits with your theme of Apprenticeship. Also worth watching is Mah\u014d Sh\u014djotai Arusu, another story of apprentice witches ruled by happenstance and unseen logic. Making use of a limited budget with some brilliant experimental animation and inventive character and creature designs.<br/><br/>The works of William Hope Hodgson (but especially the Night Land) and a Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay are brilliant works of the imagination, amazing settings and imagery. Lindsay was not the greatest writer but a Voyage to Arcturus is definitely one of the great novels of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Edit: More just after I posted<br/>The anime series Mononoke (not the Ghibli film) is brilliantly animated and filled with some of the best grotesque japanese fairy tale imagery. The plotting is a bit problematic but the images are so captivating you won't likely notice<br/><br/>The films The Taste of Tea and Funky Forest capture some of the most fantastic weird I have ever seen.

Pan's Labyrinth, absolutely. I'll check out those other ones too.<br/><br/>Keith, this is for a long-form two player game I am writing for my spouse, about the rise to power of a sorcerer's apprentice. You explore the mysteries of the vast and labyrinthine tower, uncover the sorcerer's secrets, build relationships with strange characters, and strike terrible bargains get get what you want. Because it can be really exhausting to play two-person games and I hate doing prep, the system helps you generate the characters, locations, and situations on the fly. There's almost no violence, but there is lots of super queer sex.<br/><br/>I was reflecting on a conversation I had with the spouse over the weekend about folklore and fairy tales: there's an organizing principal that tends to pervade the stories, providing them with an internal moral logic that gives events their meaning. The problem is that the moral logic of even some of the older tales is often transparent to the point of being trite, and isn't appropriate for the stories I'm try to tell. So maybe what I can do instead is borrow specific figures and imbue them with new organizing principle specific to my game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell" title="KirkMitchell"><img alt="KirkMitchell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">KirkMitchell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406538/#Comment_406538" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T14:38:02+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  2:38PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obvious is good, Tulpa, because most of these sources are unknown to me!
