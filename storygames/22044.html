It\u2019s a tense situation and someone needs to take control! Meanwhile, a navy vessel is in pursuit, and will catch up at any minute and attempt to throw you all in jail.<br/><br/>It\u2019s a potent and very simple start to a game, and illustrates almost everything about the genre that you need to know right off the bat.

King Arthur is there, and a varied set of other arthurian figures as well, whomever the GM likes to have. New player character knights are introduced to the round table, the players get to self-introduce in whatever manner they like. The Siege Perilous is discussed, perhaps, or Merlin gives a prophecy, or whatnot. The king might refuse to begin the feast before "an adventure appears" because that's always what seems to occur in these Pentecost gatherings. Sir Kay drinks himself to a stupor that becomes worse and worse every passing year.<br/><br/>If you run the game at e.g. conventions, you get to play that same scene again and again and again. It's also often the first scene of the session for campaign play, being the default start. The repetition has the dual effect of encouraging the GM to gild the lily with trained bits and gimmicks, and to expand the scene in various directions to have variety and not go crazy running it. The players also have plenty of opportunity to bring their own variety to it.<br/><br/>My favourite adventure to start from the Pentecost, one that I often end up running for new players who haven't seen it yet, is the adventure of the white hounds: a snow-white stag breaks into the castle and scampers in the middle of the round table, only to be followed by a pack of white hunting dogs. From thence the situation develops into a fairy challenge fit for brave knights to prove their mettle, and unlike the usual knight tale the princess is introduced at the start (she's the stag) rather than at the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482637/#Comment_482637" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-27T15:37:15+00:00" title="April 27, 2019  3:37PM">April 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love <b>Psi*Runs</b> basic premise.

The RPG has a rich, detailed alternate 19th century setting with magic and fae and nephilim and weird chaos vs clockwork mystical building blocks and... you don't need to know about any of that for the purposes of this scenario. I mean, okay, there are fae blooded and beastfolk, generally the product of experiments. Now you know that. For the rest...<br/><br/>There are 6 PCs. You're all members of a child street gang in London, the Penny Reds. Your leader, St. James, has gone missing. No one gives a shit if he lives or dies except the six of you. Go.<br/><br/>Maps are great -- I've seen perfect magnified maps of the Titanic for one game, amazing maps of the cosmos, all of that. Here? Okay, here's a map showing about 6 streets of London. This is your turf, from here to here. Over here? That's the Cutter Street Gang, your rivals. This is your world. Your entire world, all you need to know.<br/><br/>While I'm a sucker for Victorian Steampunk, you could lift the premise, and pretty much the rest of the scenario, just changing names and location. You can move it anywhere. Okay, maybe you remove a reference to fae blood or icky scientific experiments and tweak the two characters affected a tiny bit. It's not important. What's important is that your world is made up of 6 streets and 6 people you care about, and one of them is missing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482680/#Comment_482680" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-28T10:19:14+00:00" title="April 28, 2019 10:19AM">April 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Lisa Padol" rel="nofollow">Lisa Padol</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I fell hard for "In For a Penny" for Clockwork: Dominion. </p></div></blockquote>\nThanks for the recommendation, the scenario looks very close to my taste!

I've since run it there and at Gen Con. The structure's pretty simple: Find out what happened to your leader. The GM should have a handle on the fairly simple timeline and on who knows what and what needs to happen to get them to talk. Presuming the PCs get the information, the next part is to use it and resolve the situation. There may or may not be physical combat. There will almost certainly be social combat. There may or may not be sneaky stuff.
