The feeling is overwhelming, like I'd have to learn and memorize almost every page before I could run a game. It seems like I need to know both the fictional causes for rolls, the rules governing various rolls (and their exceptions), and all the options that come up from any given action, since any of these could come up at any time during the game. Like some opens their brain to the maelstrom, except they just had sex, so now I need to know the rules for that type of character under a certain situation, and what I, as GM, need to tell them (e.g. choose two of the three following options...).<br/><br/>Then again, I've probably been brain damaged by 30-page one-mechanic-does-all Forge games. It just seems so daunting, upon a first read.<br/><br/>Or do you constantly flip back and forth through the book(s) as you play? If so, doesn't that make things terribly slow?<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's exciting to see another lumpley game that I actually have enough dice to play!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke" title="NoahTheDuke"><img alt="NoahTheDuke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke">NoahTheDuke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260111/#Comment_260111" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T18:47:14+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  6:47PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2010 6:49PM by NoahTheDuke.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I printed and assembled a copy of every playbook, cuz I liked reading them in that format, but I doubt that's necessary. I do think the MC should read through the whole MC Playbook before play starts, just to get a feeling for the game and the mechanics, but there is no reason to memorize everything. Almost all the rules are self-explanatory through their descriptive names. The gun modifiers? Almost totally descriptive. All the mechanics/moves for the characters NOT in your game? Forget them forever (until next game). Every playbook has the main/core moves in the front, so all the players have a copy.<br/><br/>I'd suggest printing off pages 169 from the MC Playbook for a reference. It's really the only necessary piece the MC needs. If you can follow the principles and the MC Moves, your game will run smooth. No need to worry about all the other parts.<br/><br/>And remember:\n<blockquote>"\u2022 Make Apocalypse World seem real. <br/>\u2022 Make the players\u2019 characters\u2019 lives not boring.<br/>Everything you say, you should do it to accomplish both of these, and no other. It\u2019s not, for instance, your agenda to make the players lose, or to deny them what they want, or to punish them, or to control them, or to get them to your pre-planned plot points (DO NOT pre-plan plot points, and I\u2019m not fucking around). Go chasing after any of those, you\u2019ll wind up with a boring game that makes Apocalypse World seem contrived."</blockquote>is the most important part of the whole MC-side game.<br/><br/>Also, remember that you're awesome. You'll do really well, even if you feel like you'll do poopy.<br/><br/>Noah                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260126/#Comment_260126" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T21:02:34+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  9:02PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You really don't need to know what your characters' powers do.  Like, if someone has sex you can say "Oh, okay, what's your sex move do again?" and then they will look on their sheet and tell you.  And then you'll go: "Wow, that's fucking awesome."  All you need is a list of the possible things players can do -- Act Under Fire, Have Sex, Open Their Minds to the Maelstrom, Seize With Violence (or whatever it's called), etc.  When any of those things happen, you can look up the exact rules for it.  Over time, you'll learn them all, but I don't think you need to know them off the bat.  And let your players be responsible for their special moves.  If the Skinner has to remind you that they paralyze people when they take their clothes off, that's okay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260130/#Comment_260130" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T21:57:06+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  9:57PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After I read it through, I wrote out a list of the MC moves, the all-Player moves and Vincent's list of 'rules' (ie Barf forth Apocalypica, &amp;c) and pinned those to my GM shield.

Specifically how the game mandates the ways in which the GM is interacting with their characters and with NPCs. Once everybody is clear on this you can retreat back behind the curtain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260201/#Comment_260201" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T09:19:14+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  9:19AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to threadjack, but I have a couple of random specfic questions.  <br/><br/>What does +1Forward mean, exactly?  <br/><br/>When the Driver sleeps with someone and gets -1, what does that modify?

The guidelines for running the first session are good, and you shouldn't worry too much about having to look things up.  <br/><br/>That said, the Hx rules as written in the MC book are confusing- take a look at the <a href="http://lumpley.com/apocalypse/players-refbook-part1.pdf" rel="nofollow">revised character reference book</a>, which has easier-to-follow instructions for establishing Hx for each character.  Get this straight in your head before the game, otherwise it might get messy at the table.<br/><br/>One thing I had some trouble with was authoritatively setting scenes and aggressively positioning the PCs in interesting places to make moves.  There are examples of this in the book, and it's pretty standard "fishing" technique - "Okay so Dizzy and Pandora are hiding in a shell of a building in the old ruins while Compton and Montana's gangs are shooting at each other in the streets outside- what does this place look like, and what the hell are you even doing here?"
