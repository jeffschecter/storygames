This is my second game (my first in English) and I am very anxious to hear what you think of it at this early stage.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://apmproduktioner.se/img/annodaemonum-poster.jpg"/><br/><br/><b>The pitch</b><br/>\xbb There is no such thing as demons \u2013 demons don\u2019t exist \xab<br/>This is a GM-less roleplaying game about desperate people who have recently crossed an invisible line into the demonic realm. They only know this from the feeling that they now carry within them: A feeling of demonic presence. It grows in the vicinity of conflict as if the demons thrive there, feeding from the hostile energies at the same time as they fuel those conflicts with violence, sorcery, and corruption.<br/><br/>This game is influenced by Hillfolk (Robin D. Laws), Trollbabe (Ron Edwards), Don\u2019t Rest Your Head (Fred Hicks), Nemesis (Dennis Detwiller &amp; Greg Stolze) and Apocalypse World (D. Vincent Baker).<br/><br/><b>The play-test documents</b><br/>The webpage <a href="http://www.annodaemonum.com/" rel="nofollow">annodaemonum.com</a> is up and running, but doesn't really contain much more than the <a href="http://www.annodaemonum.com/play-test-documents/" rel="nofollow">play-test documents</a> at this point.<br/><br/>The rules text is basically 7 pages, written in a similar way to how you would program computer code (to make it things unmistakably clear and concise). You should be able to start reading the rules from the top, and be sure not to miss anything.<br/><br/>The game is to be played by 2-4 players over several sessions. The alpha version is distributed as a print-and-play game with 120 cards that needs to be printed. You will also need 20 tokens and a bunch of six-sided dice.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.annodaemonum.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Anno-Daemonum-V022-1140x665.jpg"/><br/><br/>These are the downloads:<br/>* <a href="http://apmproduktioner.se/files/annodaemonum-design-notes.pdf" rel="nofollow">Design notes</a><br/>* <a href="http://apmproduktioner.se/files/annodaemonum-v025-printer.pdf" rel="nofollow">Game rules</a><br/>* <a href="http://apmproduktioner.se/files/annodaemonum-character-sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Character sheet</a><br/>* <a href="http://apmproduktioner.se/files/annodaemonum-game-sheets.pdf" rel="nofollow">Game sheets</a><br/>* <a href="http://apmproduktioner.se/files/annodaemonum-cards.pdf" rel="nofollow">Cards</a><br/><br/><b>What kind of feedback do I want?</b><br/>At this point I'm mostly interested in hearing how well the rules text is understood, but perhaps the most valuable feedback would be that from gameplay - so if you would like to try it out and tell me about your experiences I would be ever so grateful!<br/><br/>Apart from commenting here you are welcome to join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1901707053492037/" rel="nofollow">Facebook group</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/annodaemonum/" rel="nofollow">Facebook page</a>.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!

This is the intention for the final product as well, to have separate booklets with the 7 pages of rules, and then to have a thicker book with design notes, and further discussion about the game, primarily for the facilitator / person who owns the game.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" rel="nofollow">BeePeeGee</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In any case, it seemed to me that I need  more of an explanation what the game and setting is really about.

The setting for example is intentionally left vague at this point as I've primarily focused on the mechanics and how they work during play. In these play test versions there is no setting other than the general premise that the player characters are haunted by demons somehow - the details are created during play. This will probably change later on when I feel the mechanics have been fine tuned and working to my satisfaction. Maybe there needs to be a more specific setting in the final product.<br/><br/>And you're right, maybe the cover suggest something too specific for the game at this point. May I ask what it communicates to you? What expectations that arise?<br/><br/>I have ten candles on my wishlist and will check it out as soon as I get my hands on it!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" rel="nofollow">BeePeeGee</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>2-4 players instead of 1-3 additional players seems clearer.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nYes, that is noted!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" rel="nofollow">BeePeeGee</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The X-card is already a quite established technique.

I personally want the x-card to be used. If it isn't used I don't know if it's working properly. I want to take the edge off of using it by being able to use it in several ways. This way there is a scale from o (full approval) - neutral - x (try a different way) - x (cut). Thus using the card more frequently might steer away from the cut-situations alltogether.<br/><br/>It's like if a blindfolded person was driving a car on an empty parking lot and you as the passenger only had the phrase "stop! turn around!" to guide them. If you instead also got to use "this is a good direction" and "you need to turn" you will be able to guide the driver more efficiently, maybe never having to say "stop! turn around!" at all. I hope this makes sense. I'm going to evaluate how the x-card works after some more play testing.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" rel="nofollow">BeePeeGee</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Looking forward to see more from Anno Daemonum!</p></div></blockquote>\nThanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470523/#Comment_470523" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-10T15:38:47+00:00" title="March 10, 2018  3:38PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/APM" rel="nofollow">APM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Yeah, I'm not sure about this.

It's muddying the waters of something that is NOT a tool for expressing approval or disapproval. There is no flipside to the X-Card, no degrees of X-Cardness.

If I had to guess, I'd say that Ron communicates the conceit in the introduction of the book, the first chapter - that's where I remember reading it. Could be that he didn't use those exact words in the original text, though, and it's just one of these bits of "how Forge plays Sorcerer" lore that has tended to accumulate around that game particularly.<br/><br/>It's certainly the way people always explain the concept in the Internet when explaining Sorcerer: demons do not exist in any kind of setting design sense, they do not follow the natural order, they don't make sense - yet your character has one anyway.<br/><br/>If you google it a bit, you'll find that it's a pithy tagline that's often associated with Sorcerer.

There is always a spectrum: I'm allergic to apples and some nuts but not to the extent that I choke when I eat them. It's till an unpleasant experience most of the times - so I often choose not to eat those kinds of food. Now, is that allergia to an extent that would allow me to use the x-card or is it more of "it itches like hell in my throat - so I don't want to eat it"? I think this is the same for play experiences.<br/><br/>There are degrees of how bad you feel when you feel discomfort - and it's only you that can decide when your border has been crossed. On the contrary to allergia - no one dies from psychological discomfort so to me it's all a matter of preferences, just that some people's preferences are really strong.<br/><br/>Anyway, I will think about this during the future development. I'm still not convinced that I'm doing something objectively wrong. I think my version could work better for some, and then worse for others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470617/#Comment_470617" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T16:48:38+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  4:48PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your game has interesting things to say about demons and other fictional subject matter (or real-life stuff), definitely give us a taste of that!<br/><br/>If the appeal is more about the system, though, that's fine too -- you just need to tell us what we'll get out of the system that we aren't getting from our other game systems.<br/><br/>For example, I would definitely read through a game draft which promised, "These rules will have you gleefully riffing off each other's creative contributions like never before!" or some such.<br/><br/>A case in point is <i>Annalise</i>.

So I've given this whole setting-question some thought and I wrote a summary of the things that I find most interesting. I know it's quite a lot of text for a pitch but maybe you could point me in the direction of what bits of it you found most intriguing? That would be a tremendous help!\n<blockquote><br/><b>Pitch material</b><br/><br/>The basic recipe of this game is:<br/>+ desperate &amp; unstable people<br/>+ dangerous &amp; unreliable tools<br/>+ spontaneous &amp; emotional choices<br/>= interesting characters to drive the narrative<br/><br/>The player characters are real people in an unreal situation.<br/><br/>The big questions are:<br/>* What do they desire/want? Why do they want that?<br/>* How far are they willing to go to get it? What are they prepared to do to other people? What are they not prepared to do?<br/><br/>The demons are a shortcut to getting what the characters want. But it's unpredictable and may lead the characters in two ways:<br/>* Seclusion - Accepting and enforcing the belief that that the demons exist. Thus learning to control their power and grow more powerful and ruthless<br/>* Society - Fighting the irrationality of the demons' existence by tearing down the illusion and exposing their moral complications.<br/><br/>You may look at the above as a form of alignment - society vs seclusion, good vs bad or light side vs dark side. It's about finding out if your character succumbs to the temptations of power. If so: With great power comes great responsibiltiy - how do they handle that?<br/><br/>Note however,that this isn't a game about fighting the horror. There's no lurking fear or demonic fiends that that pose an external threat. Instead, the player characters conjure these demons involutarily and they have to deal with it one way or the other. The threat comes from their own choices. Also, sorcery in Anno Daemonum is not ritual magic - it's instantaneous, impulsive, subtle, and constantly within reach. N.b. the demons are not characters - there's no talking or interacting with them. <br/><br/>All characters have a trigger event that pushed them across the border into the demonic realm. In doing so the demons now may pass into the realm of the living when their targets (the player characters) are desperate and weak. The characters have all been marked when they entered the demonic realm and the demons have their eyes on them from then on, stalking and watching from beyond - breaking through into the realm of the living whenever conflict occurs.<br/><br/>The fiction is based on the mechanics and thus it's a mechanics-first kind of game. The mechanics forces a certain type of narrative with reincorporation and a tight web of people &amp; places. It's a close-up personal narrative, with focus on personality and morals. There is no room for world domination or conflicts between organizations in these narratives. This is personal. If you want something done you have to do it yourself. The demons are not your henchmen. Furthermore, the characters are above the law, above religion. Once the characters have passed the border into the demonic realm, they are disconnected from society - no one can help them except for themselves (or perhaps each other?).<br/><br/>What might happen during play:<br/>* Power struggles between characters<br/>* Characters showing vulnerability<br/>* Characters doubting what' real and what's not<br/>* Characters hurting each other to get what they want<br/>* Characters loosing control, doing things they didn't intend to<br/>* Characters aiding and interfering with each other<br/>* Ambiguous characters neither good nor bad - acting out of their own logic</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470713/#Comment_470713" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-17T13:17:19+00:00" title="March 17, 2018  1:17PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that a lot!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470715/#Comment_470715" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-17T13:43:13+00:00" title="March 17, 2018  1:43PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

There is however two ways to retire your character - either due to incapacitation (i.e. harm) or when they have become one with the demons.<br/><br/>Becoming one with the demons means that you have so many hard experiences that you have full control over the demons - but sadly this is also when you stop being able to distinguish your own free will from those of the demons. So the player loses control of their character and the PC becomes an NPC from that moment on.<br/><br/>Does that answer more questions than it creates new ones? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470733/#Comment_470733" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-17T21:52:15+00:00" title="March 17, 2018  9:52PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The pitch now seems a lot clearer.

I have been thinking about what happens when the desire is resolved. A character who wants love - what happens when they finally get it?<br/><br/>So I would guess that's a good point to end a story: when it's clear whether the characters will get that which they desire or not, when it's clear what they've paid to get it or how far they were willing to go.<br/><br/>That is probably the end state if the characters stay alive and sane. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/APM" title="APM"><img alt="APM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/APM">APM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470755/#Comment_470755" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-18T08:47:12+00:00" title="March 18, 2018  8:47AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" rel="nofollow">BeePeeGee</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The pitch now seems a lot clearer.

I created the desires and wants as a help for players to more easily being able to identify what their character might do next. Thus narrowing down the scope of the story that is created.<br/><br/>I would say that generally, scenes should either adress a want or the desire - but sometimes scenes aim just to establish what a relationship is like (how two characters interact with one another). But in the long run I think not paying attention to the desires and wants might end up in non-consistent play that "misses the point".<br/><br/>Yeah, now that I think of it. If a character that totally ignores the desire, only to embrace the demons and cause havoc - that won't be the kind of gameplay I want for the game.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If play is supposed to be about pursuing Desires, are there any rules or principles which guide or support the group in doing this?</p></div></blockquote>\nI don't think there are any mechanics/principles that enforce players to pursuing their desires in this version. The desire as of now is primarily a help for creating a character that is headed in a certain way. For me it feels natural to continue in that trajectory exploring what it's all about, but I guess if players want to do a bunch of other stuff, there's nothing stopping them. But then again - there are no incentives for them to do that either. <br/><br/>I don't really know what kind of principles would help here. I can imagine a method similar to FATE Core where you would get some kind of benefit from every scene where you pursue your desire, but that's not a way I'm really prepared to go. Do you have any examples?<br/><br/>My original thought was that just by having the players choose a desire and writing wants towards other characters, would maybe nudge them into playing in a way that I intended, without any further mechanics/principles.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470779/#Comment_470779" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-18T18:43:06+00:00" title="March 18, 2018  6:43PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello,<br/>About the procedures : <br/>- I like the sobriety of it. <br/>- Sex stands out.<br/>- the algorithm presentation is easier to understand : why not put it before the text ?<br/>- the negotiation for gained history is short but, could we make it after the scene ends ?<br/>About the symbols : <br/>- they are great<br/>- the two sides of a card made me think of Misspent Youth selling out<br/>- they made me want more<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470813/#Comment_470813" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-19T19:29:16+00:00" title="March 19, 2018  7:29PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2018 7:30PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game is so close to being Sorcerer already that I feel awkward recommending techniques from that game.

I mean the situation that the characters are in some kind of crisis at the start of the game is more of a standard in games these days, so there's nothing unique about that. This and the demons are two things that sorcerer and AD share.<br/><br/>The main difference I would say, is that the demons in AD are not characters. They are more of an otherworldly force that you can't interact with, speak to, or control. Yet you have some kind of power over it. So I would say that even though the setting is similar, the games have very different execution.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>here's how Sorcerer does it:<br/><br/></p><ul> <li>When you create your character, you also create an urgent situation they have to deal with.</li>\n<li>In play, as you explore them and their choices and the consequences of those choices, you are doing so in the context of them dealing with that urgent situation.</li>\n<li>The GM plays various characters that make this endeavor (dealing with the urgent situation) non-trivial, and often a conflict of interests.</li>\n<li>Once that urgent situation and all its troubles are resolved, that's a good place to end this character's story and the game.</li> </ul>\nIn practice, this produces neither a quick one-shot nor an unending campaign.

Or at least that's what I think that I'm getting with the system as of now. To be honest I took a little experimental approach to creating this game as I began with mechanics that I liked to use during play. I didn't start with pointing out what I wanted.<br/><br/>At this alpha-stage I'm more curious about what things the structures create during play than what I intend with them. As you've seen I have some kind of general idea what I want but if gameplay gives me something else I am prepared to reassess my goals.

I don't filter feedback on purpose, but I may have to tone the sibylline style down.<br/>When I say "sex stands out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" rel="nofollow">algorithm</a> presentation", I mean many games have special rules for combat, others for intoxication or gemmology. Yours has a special rule for sex. So that's that and nothing more. <br/>In Misspent Youth, the Yos' stats are two-sides like Brave/Reckless, Caring/Soft, etc. What happens when you want your character to get through, you take the heat and it firebrands you. You sell out and your naive Yo becomes jaded, taking the empty-shell dark side of their stat.<br/>When I read the 2 sided cards, I wanted more because I liked the ones I saw. You apetizer analogy fits right there. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, more like : if a group of players wants to keep with the game long term, they may want new cards published, each set bringing new dimensions to the game, zooming on certain tones or setting aspects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470852/#Comment_470852" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-20T22:19:26+00:00" title="March 20, 2018 10:19PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2018 10:20PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/APM" rel="nofollow">APM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>At this alpha-stage I'm more curious about what things the structures create during play than what I intend with them.</p></div></blockquote>Cool.

I've also came to find some other principles that are important for the game and might serve well as part of the pitch.<br/><br/>It was when I listened to a podcast episode with D. Vincent Baker where he was talking about the principles of Apocalypse World, when I started thinking what similar statements I have for this game. What I came up with was this:<br/><br/>* Your goal is to influence the fictional world that your characters live in - to change their situation by taking fate into their own hands. And the tools they've been given (as a blessing and a curse) to do this is the demonic force.<br/><br/>* Together you and your fellow players are to create a believable/intriguing story that revolves around your characters. Make the characters' lives interesting.<br/><br/>* When you are the "narrator" you're in a way a director that directs the scene, controls the camera angles and home in on the details of your choosing. You don't have complete control over the actors but at a larger scale you're the one in charge.<br/><br/>*The basic idea of the resolution mechanics is this: With experience one grows more proficient but at the same time more inhuman. The tradeoff you have to tackle is: Do you want to be an independent and powerful inhuman being, or a weak but humane person that is highly dependent on the relationships with others. You're kind of playing to find out what consequences those choices lead to.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm curious what the procedure/guidance is for creating Wants.  Are you hoping more for a team, or more for everyone trying to kill each other, or are both equally valid along with anything in between?</p></div></blockquote>\nThe wants have no guidelines as of now. For me it comes naturally that when I start thinking about a want to another person I also get a feeling for what that relationship is about. The wants can also be changed at any time. As I see it now - i prefer internal conflict. I myself try to create realtionships to the other PCs first, and not create new NPCs unless there is no other alternative. But I guess it would be equally valid if the characters never would cross paths, having completely different stories. It would just be a different kind of gameplay.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/APM" title="APM"><img alt="APM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/APM">APM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471041/#Comment_471041" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-23T15:00:07+00:00" title="March 23, 2018  3:00PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to let you know that there is an actual play episode from a play-test session I had with the Swedish podcast <i>Vi spelar rollspel</i> (translation: we're roleplaying).

If you go into conflict, you might loose humanity (as you gain hard experiences) but you might also keep your humanity (when you gain trauma).<br/><br/>So the choice you make is: 1) will i risk to get into conflict?, and 2) how far am I prepared to push myself to win the conflict? If you push yourself hard you will probably loose humanity as you gain hard experiences (it also depends on the experience card you use to win the conflict) or if you don't want to push for it, you will probably keep your humanity but gain trauma instead.<br/><br/>I might make some changes to this later on, in order to make it more of a choice and less of a result of a dice roll.

When you gain your first hard experience you've also lost the first bit of your humanity. So I would definately say there is lots of gameplay to explore the inhuman side of the characters. It is first when you've done practically every horrible thing in the deck that you turn into a demon and loose control over them.

I guess there are different things you look at for a scene depending what you plan to do during it. If you want a downtime scene to recover from conditions, you look for a character you have lots of history with, but if you want to get something from another character you set it up for conflict i guess! I hope there will be those moments when you set something up for one but end up doing the other due to the reactions of the other characters present <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><br/>I have a problem however with all systems that queue (mechanic) conflicts one after the other.

If you avoid conflict you are dependent on the good will of the other characters. In order to get what you want, you have to petition the other characters and then their players decide the answer to the petition. (There are no guidelines)<br/><br/>So i guess in practice the players who get petitioned choose the answer that feels most dramatically appropriate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471181/#Comment_471181" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T15:02:19+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  3:02PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, achieving my Wants could be either trivially easy, or completely impossible without heavy demonic assistance, depending solely on the dispositions of my fellow players?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/APM" title="APM"><img alt="APM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/APM">APM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471184/#Comment_471184" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T16:02:03+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  4:02PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2018 4:43AM by APM.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So, achieving my Wants could be either trivially easy, or completely impossible without heavy demonic assistance, depending solely on the dispositions of my fellow players?</p></div></blockquote>\nYes I guess you could say that. I mean it's the same situation that the GM handles in every other game. There has to be this kind of playful attitude towards the players messing with each other. When you play a role in someone else's scene you have a responsibility to create an appropriate challenge for the main character if they approach you for something. Creating these challenging situations is half the pleasure of being in someone else's scene. Seeing how the main character handles these situations is the other half of it.<br/><br/>But I guess one could make some kind of guideline that says you should never grant a petition unless there is a strong motivation for the character to do so. But that might not be a problem. We'll see what playtesting says <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also, if all the characters do is go around being friendly and helping each other out, the demons don't serve any real purpose - they won't appear much or at all. Thus the game is relying on the players wanting to make the characters' lives hard and full of difficult situations/choices. Maybe this needs to be more pronounced, but right now I'm not sure what happens if everyone's just being nice to each other. I kind of want that to be an option to explore as well.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471187/#Comment_471187" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T17:30:48+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  5:30PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2018 5:36PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what I gather, the Desire is not a simple matter of whether PCs help each other or not, and it makes sense to me to suggest that other players jump into GM Mode to make Desire-pursuit a dramatic struggle.<br/><br/>If your character asks my character for a favor, though, I'm not gonna GM for you; I'm gonna react in character.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really like the set of tools and dynamics you've assembled here!  It seems like play could go in any number of different directions, and I think that's fun.  That might be worth mentioning in the pitch!  Anno Daemonum seems adaptable to what different groups might want to do with it.  So I would guess that the major draw is the fictional concept (what demons are), the creative dynamic (GMless, PCs want things from each other), and the rules (resolution, character change).<br/><br/>Some of the things we discussed earlier in this thread might be more "things you <i>might</i> get out of play" than "things you <i>will</i> get out of play".  I think that was already clear to you, but maybe not to all readers.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm particularly curious about how much fun it is to engage with the conflict resolution procedure on pages 8-11 of your rules doc.  What has your experience been with that to date?  If you get any playtest feedback on that, let us know!<br/><br/>I hope this back-and-forth has been useful to you.  Not sure if this was at all what you were looking for in this thread, but I imagine there's something of value somewhere in here.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471195/#Comment_471195" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-27T19:10:16+00:00" title="March 27, 2018  7:10PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By "conflicts pile up" or "conflicts cross over".

So I would guess that the major draw is the fictional concept (what demons are), the creative dynamic (GMless, PCs want things from each other), and the rules (resolution, character change).<br/><br/>Some of the things we discussed earlier in this thread might be more "things you <i>might</i> get out of play" than "things you <i>will</i> get out of play".  I think that was already clear to you, but maybe not to all readers.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThanks for pointing this out, I will keep it in mind!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Personally, I'm particularly curious about how much fun it is to engage with the conflict resolution procedure on pages 8-11 of your rules doc.

The most fun I've had is when the demons fuel the conflict and the other players help out creating something unexpected as a consequence to the conflict. Also, the cards seem to spring the players imagination in unexpected ways which I'm very pleased to see. If I revise the whole resolution mechanic and maybe get rid of the dice, there is also a big chance that I will try to infuse some kind of bird-in-ear mechanic for the demons instead. I think that would be kind of cool: to hear these voices telling you what to do, and when you do it you loose humanity (but get what you want). We'll see what happens!

The narrator (player who'se turn it is) decides in the moment if they want conflict (it can be any time during their scene). So the way I see it, there is nothing preventing a player from realizing something during a scene that leads to a totally unexpected conflict.<br/><br/>For example, if I know that someone has trash-talked me behind my back, but I don't know who it is. I could have my sights set on a character to blame, who then tells me it in fact is my brother (who happens to stand next to me). That would perhaps lead to a fight between me and my brother...

There have been during other play tests though, and even though it might be a big spend of resources, it doesn't have to be. Whether you can afford two conflicts or not, pretty much depends on how easily you win the first one. Narratively it has felt like two conflicts sometime make a lot of sense.<br/><br/>For example: I had one session where the first conflict in a scene was to convince my husband to let me leave the apartment - which was solved by seizing a gun that he was looking for. He then tried to take the gun back which lead to another conflict where I tried to keep the gun in my possession - I don't remember how that was solved but he ended up taking the gun and ran out of the apartment.<br/>(Edit: maybe it was the other way around. Maybe it was the husband's scene and he called the conflicts. Well, the outcome was the same.)<br/><br/>It felt like that scene made a lot of sense as we played it out and having two conflicts was a good option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/APM" title="APM"><img alt="APM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/APM">APM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471403/#Comment_471403" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-04T06:34:36+00:00" title="April  4, 2018  6:34AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I played a session of AD at GothCon in Sweden this easter. We were 4 players who never had played together before, but we leveled pretty quickly and there was a lot of good feedback afterwards. The session took 2,5-3 hours, I think. There were many moments where the cards created unexpected events and inspired the fiction in interesting ways. We didn't really have time to follow up on all the story-threads that we created during the startup, but I guess each player chose to follow up on the threads they found most interesting/urgent.<br/><br/><b>The story</b><br/>The story was about 4 characters in modern day Paris:<br/><b>* Henri</b> who desired friendship but couldn't get it as he was sort of an outcast (with a shallow relationship with his girlfriend Claudette). He first felt the demonic presence as he persuaded Pierre (who was a part of Henri's soccer team) to get together outside of practise.<br/><b>* Claudette</b> who desired independence but couldn't get it as she was too dependent on her boyfriend Henri. She first felt the demonic presence when her father Jean got physical with her when she tried to quit her job (at his bookstore).<br/><b>* Monique</b> who desired acknowledgement but couldn't get it as she stood in the shadow of her co-worker Jacques. She first felt the demonic presence when Marie (her boss) threatened her, after Monique had tried to convince Marie to let her go to an important conference.<br/><b>* Jacques</b> who desired order and justice but couldn't get it as his co-worker Charles was creating chaos with their research material. He first felt the demonic presence as he confronted Charles about the research material - he stared him down and sent a frightening chill down Charles back.<br/><br/><b>Scene 1:</b> Claudette comes to Henri's apartment as he is getting ready to go out with Pierre. She is upset and wants him to stay with her and comfort her. She fails that conflict and darkness envelops her as Henri leaves her in the apartment alone.<br/><b>Scene 2:</b> Monique searches for Claudette and finds her in Henri's apartment. She tries to get Claudette to leave the apartment (as she can see that Claudette is in a horrible state), but she is scared by the dark mess of a figure lying on the couch, and fails to influence Claudette.<br/><b>Scene 3:</b> Henri is at the pub with Pierre. He tries to convince Pierre to go to a horse race track together, but Henri gets rejected.<br/><b>Scene 4:</b> Jacques is in Marie's office with her and Charles. They talk about the situation with the research material, but Jacques' petition to have Charles kicked off the team is rejected. After Charles has left the room Jacques tries to influence Marie to give him priority to the research. He fails that conflict and the demons fuel it with blood and disease. Marie gets a sudden nose bleed and falls unconscious to the floor.<br/><b>Scene 5:</b> Claudette is at the bookstore the following day. She has been working all night (her father's orders) and is a complete wreck unfit to handle the customers. Jean takes over and tells her to go in the back room. Afterwards he talks to her and she petitions him to have the rest of the day off, which he grants.<br/><b>Scene 6:</b> Monique finds out about Marie's "accident" and visits her at the hospital. Jacques is also there as he followed along in the ambulance. Monique petitions Jacques to let her go to the conference instead of him. He grants it in exchange for her help getting him into an even bigger conference at a later time.<br/><b>Scene 7:</b> Henri goes to visit his father Frank (who is sick and needs a lot of help). They talk about Claudette. When Henri tells Frank that Claudette's father has recently hurt her, Frank gets angry and tells Henri to be a man and do what he can to help her. Henri promises to do so.<br/><b>Scene 8:</b> Henri goes to find Claudette at her father's house where she has spent her day off. They have a brief argument. She is upset because she doesn't feel as if he cares for her. He says that he loves her, but then Jean's car rolls up the driveway. Claudette urges Henri to leave (saying that Jean will be furious if he finds Henri there). Henri rejects and there is a conflict. Claudette wins and kicks him out the back door, and then Jean comes in the front door. There is a second conflict as Claudette wants to leave him forever and start a new life without him. She succeeds by taking her mother with her (who apparently also wants to leave him).<br/><br/><b>The feedback</b><br/>* Petitioning as a mechanic should probably not be exclusive to the MC. There has been several occasions where NPCs have petitioned the MC (as it makes sense in the fiction).<br/>* Conditions might need to make a more prominent difference inside the fiction - right now they don't really get infused in the fiction.<br/>* Rerolling dice should perhaps be accompanied with a new discription (as in for example Dogs in the Vineyard) to get a stronger connection to the fiction.<br/>* There was a short discussion on how to use cards instead of dice, introducing new events in a similar way as Dogs in the Vineyard. I aim to explore these ideas further.<br/>* You need to be able to discard the whole hand (in case you only get a lot of high-value cards - perhaps during non-conflict scenes.<br/>* The players expressed many positive thoughts on the system. They liked the idea that when you initate a conflict you take a card from your hand and put it upside down, so that the others know what the character is trying to accomplish but not how.<br/>* Perhaps the setting needs to be formulated with a few characteristics in order to make it more central and visual.<br/>* Using history as a way to increase the dice pool for conflicts is very important as it is very hard to succeed in the beginning.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471406/#Comment_471406" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-04T12:51:49+00:00" title="April  4, 2018 12:51PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent !

I think the setup often creates antagonists as you always have a character that is related to the reason why you can't get what you desire. We hit off very good with Claudette as this possible maniac in-the-making. There was a lot of atmosphere when "darkness" was how the demons fuelled that conflict. So I guess she felt a little more interesting than the other characters.<br/><br/>And you're right, the demons tend to be very metaphorical the way I play it now. I would really like to hear how it works when demons actually appear. Anyway - we didn't talk about how the demons actually worked - the mood just went that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/APM" title="APM"><img alt="APM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/APM">APM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471462/#Comment_471462" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-05T19:58:18+00:00" title="April  5, 2018  7:58PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright.

If you want to share your thoughts on this I would be very grateful! Thanks!\n<blockquote>\xbb There are no such things as demons \u2013 demons don\u2019t exist \xab<br/><br/>Anno Daemonum is a GM-less roleplaying game about desperate people who have recently crossed an invisible line into the demonic realm. They only know this from the feeling that they now carry within them: A feeling of demonic presence. It grows in the vicinity of conflict as if the demons thrive there, feeding from the hostile energies at the same time as they fuel those conflicts with violence, sorcery, and corruption.<br/><br/>The game is played by 2-4 players over several sessions. Its eight-page rules-structure forces a certain kind of narrative with reincorporation and a tight web of people and places. It creates a close-up, personal narrative which focuses on personality and morals.<br/><br/><b>What is it about?</b><br/><br/>The goal of the game is to explore the stories of your characters through the scenes that you create for them during play. You will find out what they are prepared to do to others to get what they want, exploring your characters\u2019 moral boundaries. You will also see to what extent your character succumbs to the temptations of power, and how they handle the responsibility that entails.<br/><br/><b>The creative agenda</b><br/><br/>* Together you and your fellow players create a believable and intriguing story that revolves around your characters. You help each other make their lives interesting, dramatic and full of hard choices.<br/>* The fictional world is there for you to make a personal impression onto. The existence of the player characters never goes unnoticed in the world you create.<br/>* When it\u2019s your scene you are the \xbbnarrator\xab and your character is in the spotlight. As the narrator you take on a director stance, controlling the camera angles and homing in on the details of your choosing. You have an overarching authority over the scene as well as your character, but you\u2019re never in complete control. Your fellow players always help you play the other characters in your scenes and they control how those characters act and react within those scenes.<br/><br/><b>The premise</b><br/><br/>This game takes desperate and unstable characters (the player characters), gives them dangerous and unreliable tools (the demons), and urge them to make spontaneous and emotional choices (to get what they desire). They are real people in an unreal situation. This situation however, is one that they desperately want to change, and their only option is to take matters into their own hands. Because once they crossed that border into the demonic realm they were disconnected from society, and now no one can help them except themselves (or perhaps each other).<br/><br/><b>The setting and the demons</b><br/><br/>All player characters have a trigger-event that pushed them over the border into the demons\u2019 line of sight. And from that moment on the demons restlessly stalk and watch them from beyond, ready to break through when desperation and conflict blurs the human mind. Keep in mind however, that the demons are not characters \u2013 they are not supernatural henchmen that you can talk or interact with. They are an otherworldy force that you cannot understand, reason with, rely on, or tame.<br/><br/>It is also important to recognize that sorcery in this game isn\u2019t ritual magic. The demonic presence is a kind of sorcery in itself and it is instantaneous, impulsive, subtle and constantly within reach.<br/><br/>Anno Daemonum creates stories with a few but precise themes:<br/>* Delusions and doubt of what\u2019s real and not<br/>* To loose control and act in desperation<br/>* Vulnerability and to share one\u2019s inner thoughts<br/>* Desires that lead to irrational choices<br/>* The protagonists being the monsters<br/>* Power balance and relationship focus<br/><br/><b>How does it end?</b><br/><br/>Each player character starts out with a desire that they can\u2019t get. This is what drives the characters toward conflict initially. But, sooner or later the characters are going to get what they desire \u2013 or it might be clear that they never will. And the whole point is to see who they have become at that point, and what they\u2019ve been through. Making this struggle real for the characters is a collective endeavour which in turn determines the pacing of your game. So, when the desires have been resolved, it\u2019s a good place to end your story.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471468/#Comment_471468" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-06T09:48:19+00:00" title="April  6, 2018  9:48AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crystal clear intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21512/anno-daemonum-gm-less-story-game-looking-for-feedback" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21512/anno-daemonum-gm-less-story-game-looking-for-feedback" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21512/anno-daemonum-gm-less-story-game-looking-for-feedback/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21512%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21512%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
