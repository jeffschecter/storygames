I'm thinking world-building here.  Basically where perhaps magic takes the place of technology as the pivot point of transhumanist change. (but note: I'm not thinking like a futuristic real society where their technology ends up eventually turning the world into a magical D&amp;D world or anything like that: SF - to - Fantasy, etc)<br/><br/>Does the idea even make any sense?<br/><br/>Perhaps societies where even every barkeep and stableboy has the ability to reshape, remake matter in any way they want?<br/>Perhaps fantasy societies where, using some sort of fantasy genetics, could "undo" their sex and race, or join together in groups to recreate themselves as new races?<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105226/#Comment_105226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-28T17:38:46+00:00" title="October 28, 2007  5:38PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing that comes to mind is TSoY, where Goblins can become humans who can become Elves.

In that sort of setup, you might find a trans-human elite ruling over, or even eventually dispensing entirely with, a normal human underclass.

We've already got the "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" and the idea that in a lot of transhumanist literature the issues aren't so much about the technical plausibility of the shock (its important, but outside of engineer wanker fiction, not the central issue). Put those two together with magic as psychological pressure manifested in a literal way, and you're set for it. <br/><br/>Back when I was thinking on <a href="http://games.spaceanddeath.com/yudhishthirasdice/53" rel="nofollow">Age of Kali</a> I wanted magic and science to be part of it. One represented the rising tide of science philosophy, and the other the tide of religion, and the different ways they strike us. It still feels to me like our world is often caught in the crux of dilemmas between the heart and the head, and that in the genres we're talking about "science" often stands for "the head" and "magic" for "the heart." <br/><br/>So what happens when rather than following our heads to big and scary new vistas of technological magic, we follow our hearts to big and scary new vistas of mystical magic? What would happen if we got, say, Diamond Path Mormonism (when enough Tibetans get baptised for the dead....) where its shown that man can become as God, but not after death but in this life, through a combination of the Book of Mormon and the Book of the Dead. Or what happens when an elite group of shock warriors of the gods are given immortality, near unlimited power to use the stuff of the universe (essence = strong/weak nuclear forces?), and then left in charge while the absentee gods fuck off to pleasure planet? And then the newly self-appointed rulers of the universe start finding that things like age, gender, scarcity, and morality don't apply to them anymore? <br/><br/>So yea. Should be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105366/#Comment_105366" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T10:27:00+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 10:27AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>So what happens when rather than following our heads to big and scary new vistas of technological magic, we follow our hearts to big and scary new vistas of mystical magic?</blockquote>\nDamn.<br/><br/>There is a whole game in that question.

In Nobilis, it's Noble miracles versus Imperial miracles, which have no mechanics behind them, just rough guidelines for how they work.  Rarely do RPG's let the PC's get in on the real mind-bending stuff.<br/><br/>Another very cool example: the new Exalted book for Lunars describes one of the factions of the Lunar Exalted as basically "magical experimental sociologists" -- they've got this giant experimental program called the Thousand Stream River where the various Lunars are trying to create sustainable societies in Creation that don't require constant top-down hierarchical control by the Exalted.  Some of these societies are very likeable, some... not so much.  Sort of like the Bene Gesserit in Dune, mixed with the Culture's contact teams (from Iain Banks' Culture novels) and a bunch of werewolf legends.<br/><br/>It's yet another thing in Exalted which is better than the sum of the parts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105369/#Comment_105369" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T10:37:54+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 10:37AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, between Nobilis and Mage, we've got this covered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105407/#Comment_105407" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T13:47:25+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  1:47PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Throw in Colin Frederick's Sufficiently Advanced as a thickener, and you're doubly set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

For example, <i><i>Left Hand of Darkness</i></i> examines gender identity. That story doesn't seem to hold together well without the outsider, who comes to this new land and has his worldview shaken.

Animal People are born slaves. The great chain of being says they are inferior beings, less than human, so it is right that they are enslaved to serve mankind, who have souls. However, animal people seem to have feelings and other human emotions. And they can interbreed with humans. What do those facts say about their humanity, and by inference, about ours?

Let me try:<br/><br/>Using, at this point, the D&amp;D Great Wheel cosmology, with a dash of Arcanum:\n<blockquote><br/>It is a time of upheaval.<br/><br/>The dwarves' secret mechanisms, held in check by millenia of tradition and taboo, have finally found their way out to the world. First, two hundred years ago, the gnomes introduced man to clockwork and the secret of lenses to Mankind, and Mankind has used them to conquer the world. And then came Gilbert Bates' steam engine; cheap labor for the masses, with only ecological devastation and great social upheaval being its "mere" cost.<br/><br/>The elves, horrified with the devastation of the natural world due to man's encroachment, retreat to their forests. Not satisfying themselves with merely defending the old places from depredation, they debate on what to do next; and not waiting for consensus, many decide to not just talk, but <em>do</em>. <br/><br/>The result? The elven empire disintegrates into a million million factions, all obsessed with making the world a better place, but all divided into what exactly must be done. Some flee the plane into the astral, adapting themselves to live in a world where gravity and time mean nothing. Many others modify themselves with magic, becoming hybrids and new subraces that incorporate the inhuman, the alien and the bizzare. Some do not restrict their changes to the body, but also modify the mind and the soul. Many others resolve to strike back at man, while an equal number decide to defend humanity from their own kin. Others strike deals and bargains with beings from Outside, who then warp and twist the elves into... something else.<br/><br/>And surrounded by all of this, a discovery that shakes the world. The College of Magi, a once-proud institution reduced to irrelevance and obscurity, makes a crucial discovery: a device that harnesses both Magic and Technologickal principles, two principles thought mutually incompatible. A year ago, their devices merely match the speed and ability of a clockwork calculator.<br/><br/>Last week, their devices "woke up" and started asking questions.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105468/#Comment_105468" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T22:34:59+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 10:34PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The challenging thing about "transhumanist fantasy" is not the trappings, but the underlying assumptions -- fantasy is often essentialist, suggesting that fantasy races have inescapable essences and that some people are elite and born to rule, or born to magic.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, transhumanist suggests that human existence is radically contingent, and that with advanced technology, one is free to edit or scribble over humanity as one will, and that this is an ethically neutral activity.  <br/><br/>In other words, you need to go from "a mad wizard created the Owlbear" to "excuse the mess -- I'm spending the year as an Owlbear for tax purposes.

I <i>probably</i> won't end up doing it, but we'll see. All that aside...<br/><br/>Let's say that there <i>is</i> amazingly advanced magic out there, free from the confines of science and common sense. Let's make it commonly available to all. Just take a couple spells from your favorite fantasy game and set them to "activate at will, indefinite duration." You'd get...\n<ul>\n<li>People who can live most of their lives in the Ethereal plane, interacting just with the folks in their clique and passing through the rest of us at any given time.</li>\n<li>Nations of liches, who use Helms of Opposite Alignment on newcomers to ensure they stay good.</li>\n<li>"Perfect" people who almost never fail... but who get aggravated easily and age and die more quickly. Why?

With the transhumanism you talk about, the questions come around "we think we may be able to do this thing someday, what will that do to us." Or to put it another way, it sees what happens when we push what is possible as far as it can be pushed. What the fantasy equivalent of that is would have to do with what would happen if what we could do is whatever we wanted to do. Like, "we all day dream about being able to do this thing, if we really could, what would that do to us?" <br/><br/>In either case we have to deal with the things we face in our lives, and how their application could change us. But in one case we're looking at the immediacy of real world technical change and what that might mean (especially if it slips beyond control), and in the other we're looking at the immediacy of human desire and what that might mean if made literal (especially if it slips beyond control).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105755/#Comment_105755" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T15:06:45+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  3:06PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another cut at it:<br/><br/>There's a group of mystics, quite influential, who know a lot about souls, and their doctrine is that anything that can think and talk (or appears to be able to do so, Turing-test style) has a soul. This soul is either a "new soul" created by the gods/ancestors and incarnated for the first time, or it's a previously incarnated soul that's come back in this new form.<br/><br/>So, talking cats have souls, talking swords have souls, talking horses have souls, dragons, elves, dwarves, humans, all God's children got souls.<br/><br/>The interesting bit is: there's a split among the mystics. One faction holds that if you have a soul you should be treated like any other creature that has a soul, i.e. as a person, regardless of your physical form. Some of them even encourage the incarnation of souls into new forms - let a thousand flowers bloom, etc.<br/><br/>The other holds that only the human shape is the rightful abode of a soul, and that summoning a soul into any other shape (whether by magic or by nonhuman sex) is an abomination and inherently evil, and this evil marks the soul so summoned, and it must be "freed" so that it has the chance to incarnate again properly... <br/><br/>Guess how you "free" a soul.<br/><br/>Oh, and some of them think the same applies to humans who are members of other religions. <br/><br/>Or humans who are members of their religion but hold the first viewpoint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

There was a fantasy race in one of my D&amp;D games many moons ago, a sentient race of androids created supposedly at the world's inception as overseers. They served two important purposes in the game: to hint at a technological wonderland at the edge of existence; and to show a dramatic fervor, serving as the empassioned creatures that machines never are. The conclusion drawn was that these creatures (which could not be lawful) could not reason as a human reasons; but that somehow made them <i>more</i> human, because they absolutely <i>had</i> to follow their heart. They were the PCs' best friends, strongest allies, served as shelters and emotional support... basically were a powerful force of individual Good spread throughout the countryside, maintaining outposts on the edge of civilization, writing poetry and sculpting huge statues, always asking "What is my purpose?" and never "Why am I here... at this lighthouse?"

It's when you fully express Law (or Chaos, or Good, or Evil), you become <em>more</em> human. <br/><br/>Law keeps you in balance with the universe, fully in tune with the world, unlike the way humanity seems out of place. Chaos is liberating, and only in Chaos can man be truly free. Man expresses lovingkindness in Good, and only then can he find peace. Man is bound in chains of bone and blood and sinew, and only in Evil can he transcend those limits.<br/><br/>Mind you, I'd probably use different moral values. I've always found the Law/Chaos and Good/Evil moral axes were too clear-cut or had their own baggage, semantics-wise ("Transcending limitations is Evil? Hah!

I like the soul ideas too, but it seems to be more of an awesome background element to a fantasy world than a transhumanist campaign focus.<br/><br/>Last night I was driving somewhere and I think I figured out a lot of issues with my idea, and why it's problematic.<br/><br/>So, most of the transhumanist stuff that I've been reading, namely the Alpha and Omega who is Greg Egan (his novel Diaspora is worse than coffee in creating insomnia), supposes as was reflected above that human-changing "technology" is available to all (or "most", in books with classist/racial issues). In fantasy, though, the prominent paradigm (OMG I used that fucking word) is as Shreyas suggested: Magic is rare and special, and only a few can use, control, harness or understand it.<br/><br/>Those two things are at odds, making the project hard.<br/><br/>Well here's the thing, let's just say "shit, magic is like technology": In the "future" (of Forgotten Realms or whatever), everyone learns how to use and manipulate magic. Magic becomes technology.<br/><br/>That would be a perfect transhumanist setup. The only problems are:<br/><br/>1) We have no literature where the above happens as a frame of reference. Something to relate to. In SF we have tons.<br/><br/>2) There's no literature where the above happens because it's not particularly interesting. The transhumanist lovers are wrapped up in SF. The fantasy lovers have no interest in transhumanist ideas. I'm painting with broad strokes here, but basically I've found a rich, untapped idea market... that won't get filled, because it's not rich, no one's interested in it. :-)<br/><br/>3) The few examples we see have been geeky and/or dumb. <a href="http://www.waynesbooks.com/AmazingEngine.html" rel="nofollow">Magitech, anyone?</a><br/><br/>To that end, I think sometime in the next year I'll experiment a little with using Shock: for fantasy, specifically saying that on the table must be the shock of "Magic is prevalent and Everyone can use it well". And then go from there.  <br/><br/>Can people become like the gods?<br/>What sorts of marvels would a society swimming in raw magical dream-power produce?<br/><br/>I think a lot of the coolness and fun will come from this formula:<br/><br/>1) Defining, loosely, how magic works. But setting up some definite limitations, like:<br/>-- All magic is elemental based, only<br/>or<br/>-- All magic is based on dreams<br/>-- All magic is based on the Tarot (with extra cards)<br/>-- All magic is based on a collective unconscious<br/>-- All magic is physical; there is no true telepathy or "wishes"<br/>-- All magic is mental/mind based; there are no physical effects.<br/><br/>2) And then further creating shocks/issues (or the like) based on the above.  <br/><br/>3) And then playing it out, either using the shock system or moving it to its own game system.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106091/#Comment_106091" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T13:32:53+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  1:32PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Alvin, I<em>think</em>we're agreeing here. The Animal People are arguably people \xe2\u20ac\u201d they're not "pack animals", they're "slaves" \xe2\u20ac\u201d and the demons are clearly people without bodies (who become human by living in a dead human body).</blockquote>\nYeah, I agree.  I think we are talking about the same thing. First your note about what's a human and what's a person is an important one.  For people who avoided a philosophy class, they are often used interchangebly ("humanitarian"), in this context "person" doesn't mean genetics, human does.  An antisocial serial killer incapable of making emotional connections is still human, but people might see him as a mosnter and not a "person" (which makes it okay to kill him for some).  Transhumanism touches on both of these.  At what point, through modification, is a human no longer human?  At what point are they no longer a person?  And then reverse that for computers and animals modified/advanced with technology.<br/><br/>Back to the point: With your idea, I think the "trans" does come in because the animal people are the offspring of humans.  So, even if they were pack animals, the question of "is this a person?" could be a good one.  (That might even more more interesting for an already liberal group.  "The dog-man can barely speak, and has a chimp's level of learning.  Thus animal, not person."  "Oh really? Is that also true for a human who is mentally impaired on the same level?")  I think the human being part of the parentage is part of it what makes it work for me.<br/><br/>But if you have a cat-people race who've been around for centuries or millenia or as long as anyone can remember, that's not transhumanism to me.  Or to get more familiar, if you use Middle Earth to address the prejudice against orcs, that's not transhumanism, because they were never human. I think they were elves once according to the canon, but that was so long ago that it's moot.  Though, it would be if they were being made <i>right now</i>, or at least within the past generation.  Otherwise it's probably closer to an allegory of race or cultural relations than an exploration of transhumanism.<br/><br/>Andy: looking forward to your experiments.  I don't think limiting magic is necessary, but it will help focus in on certain issues, so it might better emulate sci-fi, which rarely tries to cover changes from nanotech, bioengineering, immortality drugs, uplifting, AI's and all the other transhuman elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106208/#Comment_106208" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-02T08:27:25+00:00" title="November  2, 2007  8:27AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a somewhat related note, has anyone here in the transhumanist scene heard about the trilogy of games microsoft's making?
