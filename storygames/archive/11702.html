We had a good time, and created an appropriately twisted tale, complete with Southern accents and a baby everyone was trying to either steal, give away, or just keep secret in order to preserve various reputations. One character, a young lady who was the local crime lord's daughter, was arguably the center of attention, and pretty much every character had a crush on her, to various degrees. This was particularly humorous as the girl wasn't all that likeable--really, she had few if any redeeming qualities. The baby was hers, of course: a result of a one-night stand with a local miner.<br/><br/>The setup portion of the game was fantastic, and I don't think anyone had any trouble figuring out what goes where. We had plenty to work with, right away.<br/><br/>In terms of the people involved:<br/><br/>I've gamed a couple of times with the facilitator/organizer of the game (if you're reading, please feel free to say hi!), but the other three players were people I was either meeting for the first time or barely knew. So, there wasn't a "existing group" dynamic going on between us.<br/><br/>A few questions came up, however, and I found a few aspects of play difficult to manage, so I'd like to ask how you (Jason, other Fiasco fans) handle these problems, if and when they come up.<br/><br/>1. One of the players had played the game at Dreamation and remembered playing Resolve scenes by drawing a die at the start. So, a player would say, "I want to Resolve a scene; you guys Establish. I'm taking the white die, so it's a scene that will go well for my character. Let's go!"<br/><br/>I found this really strange--why would we want to know the outcome before we play the scene? So, during the "intermission", I glanced through the book and found that the text and examples all seem to instruct us to play out the scene first and have the Resolving player only choose the white or black die at the moment of resolution (whenever that might be during the scene). This seemed much more interesting and robust to me, so I brought it up to the group and we agreed to play Act Two that way. <br/><br/>Which is correct? The latter definitely felt better, for me, but I'm not sure what the other players thought.<br/><br/>2. When Establishing scenes, it felt pretty awkward to decide who was going to say what and when. Generally, whoever had an idea first (or whoever was loudest) tended to go ahead and Establish a scene. Once a scene was under way, things tended to go well: we would all collaborate to introduce other characters and play NPCs. But the initial framing was difficult, at least for me, because I found myself worrying about whether I should speak or stay silent almost every time. On one hand, I want to contribute to the game, to share my ideas. On the other hand, if I Established the last scene, or was a major player in it, I feel like I should stay out of the way and let a quieter player take over. But if I've been quiet for a while, suddenly I might find everyone looking at me and waiting for me to say something when I rather have no ideas at all. I found myself wishing the game made it a little clearer for me to know when to talk and when to keep quiet, just so I could jump into a role and play it to the hilt, whether as protagonist, NPC, or scene framer, without worrying about whether I was hogging someone's else's spotlight.<br/><br/>3. In general, the lack of strong mechanical support for scenes made it difficult to bring conflict and adversity into the scenes (and we often didn't at all--is that how the game is intended to be played, or did we miss something?). Even the Resolving player, by assigning a black or white die, didn't seem to make much of a difference. A scene would pretty much be over, and the dice tended to be assigned kind of in retrospect. When you play the game, do you explicitly locate a conflict, and discuss a little about what the black and white dice might mean (similar to setting stakes)? We didn't, which made the die choice often rather inconsequential. ("Did that scene go well for your character?" "Well, yeah, I suppose we could say it did! I'll take the white die.")<br/><br/>After the intermission, I suggested that we try to create conflict a little more explicitly when Establishing scenes (as suggested in the book, according to what little I read there during the intermission). However, even that didn't happen very reliably. Without a sense of clearly divided authority, everything that was narrated (except for speech and action in-character) was being entered into the fiction by concensus, which worked fine for us but often meant that disagreements between players led to conflicting ideas being discarded for a compromise or third way. Instead of creating any conflict in the story, we tended to collaborate until all the conflict had been bled out of the resulting scene. It was difficult to find a space where we could "push" against each other in the fiction. There were a few times I tried to create conflict by playing an NPC aggressively, for instance, hoping to create a conflict that the die choice would resolve. Almost every time, however, narration from other players ended up sidestepping that conflict and focusing on something else. It felt more like we were all trying to fit in a piece of the story we wanted to tell, and there was no easy way to turn that into a source of dramatic tension, so we tended to drop anything that didn't create instant concensus.<br/><br/>I found myself really looking forward to the Tilt and the final outcome as a point to get back on the same page and be surprised by unexpected results (which both managed very well).<br/><br/>3. With those things in place, the game started moving further and further towards what someone here once described as "storyboarding": collaborative decisions made about what might be cool in the story that left little or no need to actually play out or narrate what was happening in the fiction. In the second act, there were several scenes that didn't see any character-play or narration at all. There were some cool events and plot twists, but no dynamic tension at the table, as the outcome was generally already settled ("How about your character gets distracted by a maid he used to sleep with, and after, uh, events transpire, she's smoking and sets off the TNT accidentally?" "OK, great idea!").<br/><br/>In general, this was an issue for me: it often felt like we were creating scenes without any constraints in place, without any uncertain outcomes. Just collaboratively deciding what would happen next, and throwing out creative ideas. Now, there's nothing wrong with that, but it's very difficult to create any dynamic tension in the story while playing this way--maybe that's not part of the intended style of play for Fiasco? I'm curious.<br/><br/>I suspect that familiarity with the game would give us a little more to work with in terms of strategy--choosing dice based on the outcomes we would like to see for certain characters--which we began to see a little bit towards the very end of the game, but even so it didn't feel like the die choice changed anything in the scenes we were playing. It was never clear to me, as a player, what a certain die choice (black or white) implied in the fiction, in terms of a particular scene, since, with four or five narrators, it was difficult to focus in on one point of tension. One player might narrate what I see as conflict (some bad men approaching!), but the resulting narration of the scene could easily sidestep that entirely: "Oh, the character goes into the other train car, but then realizes she doesn't have a ticket on her."<br/><br/>In other words, sometimes it felt like we were "storyboarding" right through the game. How can you avoid that while playing Fiasco? For instance, in the second act, we ended up with four or five black dice remaining. That meant that we all knew our next three of four scenes would not go well for the main characters. So, I'm Establishing a scene for my character, and hoping to see how the other players Resolve it... but we all already know it won't go well. While I understand how this models aspects of the genre, it made the narration of the scene very hard not to "storyboard". Because, even as I'm Establishing the scene, I already know it must end a certain way.<br/><br/>So, overall, fun game (don't be mislead by the number of words I've used to describe the problems!) but a few points of awkwardness left me wondering if we missed or misapplied some elements of the system.<br/><br/>What do you think? Has anyone else found the lack of mechanical support in free play difficult to manage?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261004/#Comment_261004" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T12:55:49+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 12:55PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul, this is great. I'm sorry your game was rocky but your thoughtful questions will make the next one way better.<br/><br/>1. You are right, the other dude is wrong. <br/><br/>2. The game very, very deliberately leaves you with lots of space to sort this out yourself, based on what your group is comfortable with. If you aren't playing with established friends it's more important to either strongly facilitate or hash this stuff out early.<br/><br/>3. It is totally OK to have color scenes, where at the end you need to make a more or less aesthetic judgment about positive or negative outcomes. Some groups really enjoy crafting these, others go for the throat constantly. If you were dissatisfied with color scenes, or your group <i>wanted </i>juicy conflicts but wasn't getting them, hopefully the game wasn't getting in your way.<br/><br/>3. I've seen "storyboarding" a lot, actually. It is something akin to pre-play that is best avoided, as a general rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261007/#Comment_261007" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T13:05:05+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  1:05PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>Thank you for the incredibly quick response!

That said, sometimes it's hard to determine what positive and negative might be in the situation. <br/><br/>For example, if I create a scene where my would-be rock star is presented with a mountain of coke and either stays strong and keeps his nose clean (heh) or gives in and becomes a junkie , that's kind of awesome both ways.

If you are resolving and want that white die, you pick it up at some point and that's a signal for how the rest of the scene should go, hopefully after being presented with a situation crafted by your friends that you really, really wanted to go negative on (that's their job in establishing, to make the optimal or obvious choice unattractive).<br/><br/>If you are resolving for another player, the consensus die choice shapes the rest of the scene.

We would narrate and play out a scene, but not come to any (implicit) concensus over what the turning point was. A couple of times in the second act I tried to introduce a really direct conflict while Establishing a scene (for example, I think I had one character get another drunk and then convince him to set off some dynamite in his boss's barn). But, as a group, I don't think we were on the same page: clearly at least some of the other players didn't think the die choice had anything to do with the character agreeing to go along with the plan.<br/><br/>It left me wondering if we should establish the meaning of the die choice more explicitly, almost like "stakes".

They do it by picking up a die. If I am understanding, the guys you were playing with were not correct. <br/><br/>In my experience what usually happens, at least at first, is that a scene will continue until we can't go on until we understand which direction it needs to go. Do you get the baby? Do you not get the baby? In a normal RPG that's where you'd grab dice and sort it out randomly or whatever, but in Fiasco you just need to make a decision - good or bad? Positive or negative? Happy or sad? ... and keep playing once you know, with everyone supporting the chosen outcome. You grab a black die; it is going to end poorly for you. They give you a white die, it is going to be a positive outcome somehow. <br/><br/>I think the game rewards a certain flexibility - even when you establish, scenes may not go where you want them to.

I find that aspect of die passing and claiming to be the most fascinating aspect of Fiasco--the "killer app" that keeps it from being a slightly structured freeform system with a situation generator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261501/#Comment_261501" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T15:33:49+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  3:33PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2010 3:34PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "metagame" strategies involved with the die choice seem to be the key, and one we were definitely not aware of, at least until the very last few scenes. I'm glad you brought that up, David.<br/><br/>But I'm still trying to figure out a good way to apply your advice here, Jason: I mean, what do you actually do and say at the table to get that to happen? Because it didn't happen reliably in this game. Can you give a brief example of what it looks like in your group? The few example scenes in the book were very obviously targeted at a certain "pivot" point, and all the players were on the same page there, so they didn't need to say much. But is there a procedure or "trick" or some kind, either in the book or not, that helps a group get there if it's <i>not</i> happening naturally? <br/><br/>For instance, if the person grabbing the die is choosing the turning point of the scene, do they narrate appropriately, or identify that point, or leave it to the other players to interpret, and enjoy that unpredictability? I think in this game we pretty consistently all had different ideas of what a certain die choice might mean--and then we either wrangled over it, let the loudest player take over, or ignored it to narrate whatever seemed most fitting or interesting anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261511/#Comment_261511" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T17:29:29+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  5:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, that's a tall order, Paul. I can give an example but I have to reiterate - this is all group dependent, all social contract stuff. What's bombproof for me and my crew may be shaky nonsense for yours. <br/><br/>We played last night, actually, so it is fresh in my mind. It's the first scene in the game and Joel goes first. He's playing a 16 year old girl, I am playing her 40 year old manager, our relationship is "Romance - manager and employee". We don't know what's up with that but agree that it is going to be creepy. Joel wants to establish, and sets up a scene - it's closing time, there's a customer interested in a Cartier watch, and Ginette, his character, wants to leave. "I want Ginette to make you jealous" he adds. OK. We start the scene, I pull in Mike to play the customer and I collar Ginette and scold her for brushing the rich lady off. The lady is impatient and affronted. My manager tries to make nice. Ian picks up a white die and we all silently agree, it gets handed to Joel (he passes it off to Ian as I recall, since it is Act One). I know it is going to go bad for me and good for Joel. Joel pulls in Greg to play his character Benji, whose relationship with Ginette is "Family: Cousins" and whose Need is "To get laid: To hurt someone". It was that kind of game. I start an argument and lecture Ginette about customer service, but it is plain that she has me where she wants me - utterly under her sway. Benji shows up - her cool older cousin, to give her a ride home. They talk about all the fun they are going to have partying with their friends and blow me off completely. <br/><br/>So in this scene Joel pretty much outlined a goal right off the bat, and we played toward it, not knowing how it would show up or if it would be successful or not for his character. By the end we had a very solid relationship dynamic and I knew my guy was a frustrated, creepy milquetoast.<br/><br/>We had other scenes where nothing was spelled out, where we discovered what the character wanted in play. We had zero color scenes, because my group is obsessively conflict-oriented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261529/#Comment_261529" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T20:09:49+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  8:09PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, when Joel says, "I want Ginette to make you jealous", do you find it's better for play to react with:<br/><br/>1) That's cool, I like what that'd say about my character; I'll help!<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>2) Oh yeah?

There's not even winning or losing, which is a hugely important and somewhat subtle distinction. I use positive and negative outcome very deliberately, because it is not about winning and losing. You can, and often do, get exactly what you want and still have a negative outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261717/#Comment_261717" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T14:19:05+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  2:19PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha.

Not constraining the wide open-ness, just maybe informing it more.  <br/><br/>Of course, I've played once and not read the book, so take that for what it's worth.  <br/><br/>Re: your points about stakes/opposition/win-lose vs pos-neg, I got all that within a few minutes of beginning playing scenes.  Shane didn't spell it out either; I think that the rules effectively speak for themselves in that regard.

(and thought it was fantastic) at Dreamation. While reading the rules (yes, I did read them), I also applied them to what I had learned while playing, associating them with an experience instead of just reading them for reading them's sake. Which I admit I shouldn't have done, as in the demo I played we picked our die first, and then had people make up the scene. <br/>\n<br/>\nPaul pointed out this was wrong and looked it up in the book (which I would've believed either with or without proof) and we switched during Act Two to doing that. Paul also wanted to try forcing conflict by asking "What do you want to accomplish/what is the goal" in the scene. While normally I think this wouldn't be necessary, I've mentioned before the difficulties of running indie narrative games with my local gaming club. Two of the people at least were floundering and often they need more direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis question Paul came up with asking definitely helped them focus in on their characters a lot more, and gave others material to work with. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will note this was not an established group of people that play together often. I knew all the players through the club and am on good friendly terms with three of players, but don't play regularly with any of them. There was also some... passive aggressive tension going on that I'm not going to get into, but on my end, made the game a little more... out of sorts because there clearly wasn't an energy flow going on between the group. We didn't meld at all and it made things even harder.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I try to run one or two indie games a month for the club, (a club with about 350 members, most of whom play Dungeons and Dragons, White Wolf, Traveler, or boardgames) it gets highly frustrating to be constantly trying to push people into letting go of being directed and there are nights where I just can't muster up the energy and not just feel crushed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I apologize for doing things a little wrong, Jason. But that being said, at least one person is going to go buy the game and everyone said they had fun. There were quite a few laughs and the montage scene at the end turned out pretty awesome. But there were other issues going on that night that I'm not capable of discussing but definitely affected attitudes during play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've read the thread and plan on integrating all of this into my next one shot, and hope to hell that not just D&amp;D players and a token indie player show up. Then again, that's life of the crazy organizer in the club who tries to push 'other' games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261749/#Comment_261749" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T17:57:47+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  5:57PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kate!

I hope you'll give Fiasco another go!<br/><br/>I've played with people who really struggled with the game's reliance on player engagement and input for whatever reason, and with these folks I've often found myself taking the "strong facilitator" role - throwing in suggestions, cajoling, asking leading questions, and generally pulling them along where necessary.

With other people, it's still awesome, but lacks the group effort of making something really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did try to throw a lot of my own energy out there and try to help people get into the groove. Personality conflicts arose between several people, which I'm not sure Paul knew about but I picked up on rather strongly that made me want to withdraw. <br/>\n<br/>\nI plan on running it again for the club, and I'll report on how the next one goes.

If anything, <i>I</i> was the one struggling. Heck, one of them, when I mentioned that I was having trouble playing a game with so little mechanical support within the scenes, said something like, "Well, it's an indie game! Indie games aren't about following rules, but about creating story collaboratively."

If you do run it again at the club, ruthlessly stick to four players, full stop. Maybe that means you sit back and facilitate and provide color commentary rather than play a character if you have four people dying to play, or maybe it means you turn people away after you've got three others. But 4 players and 16 dice is the game's sweet spot, so give yourself every advantage you can.<br/><br/>EDIT: What am I thinking?
