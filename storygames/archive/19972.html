Several members of our regular group recently moved away, so we're down to two, and we need new people. <br/><br/>We play once a week at my house in S.W. Denver (near Hampden and Sheridan). I'm 37. The other guy is in his mid-twenties. I've played my entire life. He's newish to the hobby. We're pretty laid back and flexible about schedules. <br/><br/>We've played a wide range of games. Favorites include Lady Blackbird, Don't Rest Your Head, Polaris, Archipelago, and Microscope. I'm more or less fluent in Torchbearer (or, anyway, I was a few months ago), and I'd love to give it another try. <br/><br/>Anyway, send me a message if you're in town and want to meet us. Maybe we can grab coffee or something and see if we'd get along. <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
