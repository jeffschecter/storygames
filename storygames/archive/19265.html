I'm planning on making it very much in the West Marches style of campaign, with some slight modifications. I'm slowly building up my own personal campaign grimoire of sorts - starting with a broad description of the setting and where the players will begin (a decent-sized, fortified settlement in the middle of what is essentially god-forsaken wildlands and forests), then creating a basic Hex crawl setup (central hex surrounded by a day's in any direction, each of which should include some kind of encounter or interesting something or other), random encounters, a couple dungeons with history and their own gimmicks/mysteries to deal with.. and so on. <br/><br/>As I'm doing this, I'm encountering an interesting paradox in that while the system itself is very rules light, I'm doing more prep work for this than I have for any of my narrative-based games in years. Lots of notes, notecards, scribbles, and so on.<br/><br/>So that brings us to the general topic:<br/><br/>How do you guys manage your campaigns, D&amp;D/OSR and otherwise? Everything from maps and story notes, to keeping track of monsters, stats, items.. relationship maps, background info. I almost feel like I need some kind of custom database to do all this, but that's obviously far beyond my programming capabilities. hah. On the other hand, there's always pen and paper, but you wind up with a three ring binder that has fifty pages of scribbles in it to thumb through. <br/><br/>Any tips, tricks or programs you've found really make your job easier?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429116/#Comment_429116" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-04T20:02:37+00:00" title="March  4, 2014  8:02PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obsidian Portal has a wiki like interface that might do the job you need.

Also of course AW Fronts and threats gives a great, lightweight sandbox framework. The internet or modules are full of details you can then plunder at the appropriate moment rather than pre-prepping everything.<br/>Also someone here said to use your maps for notes. Write on them so they document play and keep them for future reference. None of this may hit the style you're looking for of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429133/#Comment_429133" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-05T06:46:51+00:00" title="March  5, 2014  6:46AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2014 6:47AM by JDCorley.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Saladdin and myself are both early backers of the Realm Works kickstarter.

One roll can generate a pretty robust encounter if you can whip up a table pretty quick beforehand: <a href="http://intothedungeondark.blogspot.com/2014/03/sandbox-encounter-table-methodology.html" rel="nofollow">intothedungeondark.blogspot.com/2014/03/sandbox-encounter-table-methodology.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy" title="jacksonmalloy"><img alt="jacksonmalloy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/618/nNDI3IZ5905UU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy">jacksonmalloy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429151/#Comment_429151" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-05T18:39:47+00:00" title="March  5, 2014  6:39PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Saladdin and myself are both early backers of the Realm Works kickstarter.

Then throwing a handful of 'interesting locations' on the map.<br/><br/>So insofar as what I'd need to organize:<br/>* Rough-notes of maps for the 'locations' when applicable<br/>* Random encounters / wandering critters. If not one list per hex, one list per 'region' of hexes, to populate them separately.<br/>* Details for all of the encounters, including monsters and the like<br/>* Individual entries for important NPCs, complete with motivations, stats, and agendas<br/><br/>I'd like to keep adding more .. random content generation charts and things as well. Part of the emphasis of the project is actually watching what grows out of the randomness of the charts and such. Random monster-generation charts, undead charts, NPC creation charts, and so on down the line. <br/><br/>And of course, keeping track of the results of those charts as they become important to the game.. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429164/#Comment_429164" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-06T08:15:39+00:00" title="March  6, 2014  8:15AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2014 8:25AM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Saladdin">@Saladdin</a>, watched the video and thought this can be what I wanted... but definitely no, when I saw the GM screen and the book size I realized it's still too complex for what I'm looking for.\n<blockquote><br/>I developed this for my own campaign.

However, searching/cheking the results and then interpreting them into the current situation adds seconds of interruption that increase that flow interruption too much, until players concentration start to wander outside the shared imagined space, meaning you have to re-frame the whole scene. Might be not much of a trouble for either you or the players, but why not avoid this if you can?<br/><br/>Something as simple as cards with words on them solve both problems. You can have as many cards as options you have, and drawing one to read it and interpretate it takes as much time as a single roll (with no table cheking). The only thing now is how many random tables you need/can fit on the cards and how to make the mix more efficient, creative and with a bit more open interpretations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cscase" title="cscase"><img alt="cscase" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cscase">cscase</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429171/#Comment_429171" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-06T11:16:15+00:00" title="March  6, 2014 11:16AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may be too simple for what you need, but I've been lately using XMind to keep track of campaign ideas. It's a free mindmapping software where you can create nodes, connect them in different ways, write notes for each node, define simple hierarchical relationships between them, make squiggles, attach files. It doesn't do anything RPG-specific like roll on tables or draw hex grids, but for cases where a simple .txt file is too linear to represent a jumble of ideas in my head, this has been pretty cool so far. You can set a background image, so maybe you could use your region map for that background image and lay your ideas over it? YMMV, but I've been liking it more and more as I've gotten more comfortable with the interface.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jiawen" title="Jiawen"><img alt="Jiawen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/292/nR08RUP20JH7I.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jiawen">Jiawen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429456/#Comment_429456" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-14T01:25:58+00:00" title="March 14, 2014  1:25AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" rel="nofollow">MediaWiki</a>.
