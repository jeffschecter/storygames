We have idly talked about putting together some kind of community website for the game, but we haven't really figured out what kind of crazy Web 2.0 thingy to use for it. Google Groups, which allows for a mailing list, file uploads, and a wiki-esque system of web pages, seems like a good candidate so far (and its pages feature and cleaner interface put it ahead of Yahoo! Groups in my opinion), but I wonder if there isn't something better out there I'm not aware of.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157032/#Comment_157032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T17:26:49+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  5:26PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2008 5:27PM by Andy.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our problem is basically this:<br/><br/>Maid isn't "big enough" to warrant me creating a new forum for it somewhere.  I mean, it's a roleplaying game about playing the wacky adventures of anime maids, we're not out to conquer the world or anything. I'd imagine a forum would be a giant dead zone with few posts, and that's unsightly.<br/><br/>However, I definitely want a venue where people can post their ideas and own material, and see what other people are doing with the game. Because there's going to be SOME community there (and heck, if it expands enough, we can create a forum system from there).<br/><br/>Currently, the Google Groups looks like the best option because people can post to it with very little "overhead" (very easy to join and leave Google and Yahoo Groups), and because there are places to stick files and the like.<br/><br/>Another thought is to go for a forum anyway (I'd probably NOT use Vanilla, but rather something like SMF, an easy to use more traditional forum system, and only do like 1 Forum so as to keep all the topics nice and tight and together.<br/><br/>Basically, it's that balance between starting a community and creating a resource for players, vs getting too ahead of ourselves and creating more than would be used (Wiki! Forums! Skype Chat Room!) etc.<br/><br/>It seems like others are in this sweet spot (I'm thinking closely of Free RPGs released on the web, etc), wondering what you might have thought about it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157033/#Comment_157033" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T17:43:05+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  5:43PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Use a blog-like thing.

Then, I'd go with a foundation which can grow to those eventual functions.<br/><br/>Existing forums (RPG.net, The Forge) - You're relying on another service to deliver content and, perhaps, even to maintain things for you (e.g. Forrge publisher-specific forums). Further, there's no plugging-in new tools--the best you got is sticky threads.<br/><br/>Self-hosted forum and other apps - A world better, but Filip's warnings are true. Also, it's extensible (you're the admins); and by being a hosted site, you can have sub-folders with all those bells and whistles you mention above: plug in and link from main navigation, and you're rolling. I have begun GLASScutters.org at this level, knowing I will one day need a custom DB application, possibly a shopping cart system or at least a products page with links to PODs. DavidArtman.com is done with WorrdPress as the "core engine" for page building and content (article) posting, but I've plugged in a light box app (for eventual gallery/art/photo pages), and I'd drop SMF into a subforum, if the comment function on a post didn't suffice for such a "portfolio" site. But it DOES have a constant cost....<br/><br/>Google Group - Groupware functionality contributes more to community, and much expansion is already there. For instance, you can link a custom Google ID and use a public Google Calendar for convention appearances, release dates, store demos, etc; there's Blogger right there, ready to link in "designer notes" for upcoming additions; you have a web-based contact point (GMail); and the Pages function is a sort of pseudo-wiki (missing a lot of organizational functionality). Another benefit that obviates some of the "ghost town" effect is that a Google group may be publicly listed and searchable via Google. That means high hit rankings, on a generic search of your game name (whereas high hits on a private site means META tagging).<br/><br/>For what you're talking about: small community discussions, some files for stuff like play aides (?) and "modules" (?), and a bit of calendaring (?), the Google group is probably the way to go. Keep in mind your default setting--individual e-mail receipt of posts to the group can insure no missed posts, for instance (the one part of Filip's point I don't see as problematic, if you know how to use your forum/group software).<br/>-----<br/>As a brief aside: Yahoo does spam a bunch more (both in e-mailed post footers and on every page, with banners) but their Database and Polls functionality is pretty sweet from time to time; and I've found their approach to Files, Links, and Photos to be a bit more intuitive than Google Pages, which requires you to build a nav page, then build the content pages, then reorder pages to keep the nav page at or near the top of your Pages list. About as klunky as making a new wiki page, but with no controls over the side panel (no side panel at all, in fact) and a hyper-limited Main Page (where one would typically build Level 1 navigation, on a wiki; see next para).<br/><br/>Further, I've had a hell of a time getting the look and feel of the Home page of Google Groups the way I want it--defining it uses a simple form that sets up the Home page, and it won't even let you do HTML tagging in the stinking Description field. SO... you get your group icon, a text-only description, and their hard-coded Main Page navigation (newest content is top-most, barring rearrangement). At least at Yahoo, I can build the Main Page with HTML, embed artwork, and so forth; with Yahoo only forcing the standard sidebar and the Recent Posts preview (below the fully-formatable Description area, so it could be off the screen if you wanted--"past the fold" as the newsfolk used to say).<br/>-----<br/>In closing, go with Google if you can deal with its limitations and lack of a feel that it's a coherent "whole" (ex: their Calendar is an orthogonal function, which requires other users to (a) have a GCal and (b) "subscribe" to your public GCal, to actually get events integrated--Yahoo group has it's own, integrated Calendar). Go with Yahoo if you want more look and feel control and don't need wikiness (though you do have to view banner ads).<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157155/#Comment_157155" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T09:31:23+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  9:31AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check a side-by-side comparison:<br/><a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/durhamgamers/" rel="nofollow">Durham Gamers Yahoo Group</a> (original, since 2003)<br/><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/durham-gamers" rel="nofollow">Durham Gamers Google Group</a> (started recently, still debating migration)<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've discovered that Page reordering is ONLY on the Pages page, NOT on the Home page.

While Forge is quieter right now than it's occasionally been, it's still lots of pin-pointed exposure that might prove useful. Many alpha consumers and other useful folks visit the site, which might turn into some sales, reviews and other compound effects if you keep those people in the loop. (I'm saying this with convinction because I'm emphatically one of those people myself: I'm comparatively likely to miss a new indie game altogether, unless it's featured at the Forge at some point. And when I don't know about a game, I'm unlikely to play it, write reviews or actual play reports or retail it here in Finland.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's notable that these benefits of having a Forge publisher forum are a completely different thing than having a Google Group; Forge does very little to encourage individual community building around just your own game, while Google Groups and other such services allow you to post files and do other such things. So the best choice depends on which features you value more: a Forge forum gives you exposition, while a separate arrangement gives you services. Speaking as somebody unlikely to join a Google Group for any game I'm not married with, I consider the Forge forum a superior solution. Having a Google Group means that you're just speaking to yourself, while a subforum at the Forge (or any other equivalent solution) also acts as grassroots marketing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157170/#Comment_157170" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T10:18:14+00:00" title="July 17, 2008 10:18AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2008 10:19AM by Andy.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I'd apply for a Forge publisher forum in your stead, actually.</blockquote>\nUnfortunately, this game is in no way an independently-produced RPG.

Somewhere that has a bit different requirements... Story Games, say? You could ask Andy about getting a "publisher forum" here. Or try TheRPGsite, I hear that they're all about the small press.<br/><br/>Facetiousness aside, this is a tricky problem. My own first inclination would be to ignore the community-building altogether at first, if you can't latch onto an existing community. While it seems great in theory, I've yet to see anybody get significant benefit from their efforts in this direction without really going an extra mile and concentrating on the community in lieu of other things. And even then it requires something more substantial than just one game to get anything interesting going, it seems to me. The best community-results are gained by having wide appeal and making the community your main point; vestigial publisher communities are mostly just embarrassing, it seems to me. Better to spend the effort on creating an interesting website without community functions and letting the community take care of itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stryck" title="stryck"><img alt="stryck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stryck">stryck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157192/#Comment_157192" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T12:11:03+00:00" title="July 17, 2008 12:11PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            you could build your own social network on ning.com (which totally amuses me.)<br/>It has forums, blogs, photos, videos, calendars, etc.<br/><br/>Sadly there's no place to upload non-media files yet, but it does allow the owner to add custom html stuff so presumably such could be embedded/linked into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157196/#Comment_157196" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T12:21:36+00:00" title="July 17, 2008 12:21PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2008 12:23PM by David Artman.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As long as we're throwing up particular experiences:<br/><br/>For me, a publisher-specific forum at The Forge is tantamount to a Google group, in terms of exposure to me. If I haven't bought (or am considering) a game from that publisher, I don't check that sub-forum. Even when I see an interesting Subject line (on the New Posts page--my entryway), I don't click it if it's a publisher sub-forum for (a) game(s) that I don't own.<br/><br/>But if I hear of a game anywhere--RPG.net, The Forge, here, at FLGS--my FIRST stop is a Google search. Google groups figure high, in their own weighting/relevance calculations (as far as I can tell), so a Google group for "Game of FOO" will hit on the first page, typically. Does anyone know if that happens with Forge forums?<br/><br/>Further... a punter knowing/recalling a game name is more likely (I posit) than one remembering a publisher's company name (WotC, WW, etc notwithstanding). All-the-more reason to get SOME kind of presence where Google will rank you highly (a personal site can do this too, with SEO and good META data).<br/><br/>ALL that said... sure, get a Forge sub-forum and check it regularly. BUT, your first, sticky thread should direct folks to your own group ("For detailed support, including downloads and game-specific forum, go to <a href="http://..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://...</a>."). Look at Lumpley Games: anyway has "the meat," while The Forge is "the appetizer"--or maybe outdoor seating; pick your favorite meal metaphor to stretch. Or even more so, BWHQ: I've been told in the past, when posting to his forum at The Forge, to go to BWHQ for questions, because Luke's forums finally took off and he focuses his posting attention there, now.<br/>------\n<blockquote>vestigial publisher communities are mostly just embarrassing, it seems to me</blockquote>Mmmmmaybe. I can see how something like GLASScutters.org looks like a ghost town, mainly due to my lack of attention to the whole project. But in time, if I have ANY kind of adoption, I anticipate at least a few hundred posters--LARPs tend to have fairly large populations, relative to table top--and that could add up to more than a handful of posts a day; more in the busy seasons for outdoor LARP.<br/><br/>But I think you're missing a significant factor: even a sparsely used forum--so long as the owner is a regular checker--presents a "serious" and "supportive" image. Conversely, if the only way I can communicate directly to a publisher or author is through some aggregator site (The Forge, Open RPG.net) while their web page is some blurbs and a link to a POD store... well, I see THAT as more embarrassing. You (Euro) see the empty forum as "uninteresting", I see it as a minimum effort to be reachable and professional. As a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, what if the only way you could get FAQ and play support for D&amp;D was through RPG.net or ENworld? Ignore the gloss and gleam of D&amp;D and just think of the "face" that WotC would be putting forward, by not providing a community portal focussed on their product(s).<br/><br/>So... do you say "look small, because you are;" or do you say, "start fully functional, so that when traffic tries to come, they see a welcome mat spread wide?"<br/><br/>Food for thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157206/#Comment_157206" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T12:45:18+00:00" title="July 17, 2008 12:45PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are good points, David. However, in my experience the central issue is not whether you can service a community around your product, but whether you <i>should</i>. You're not selling a community after all, but a game. FAQs and other static content can be easily put on your own website without community functions, while the communities may be better serviced by dedicated website maintainers. Of course for a game like D&amp;D (or, to a lesser extent, BW) it makes sense to have your own community forums, as there is constant activity around your game and it's popular enough to figure as an identity linchpin for a great number of hobbyists. These same factors hardly hold for a small press game that is not intended to be a hobby of its own and is mostly understood in the larger rpg hobby context. For example, I don't have any intention to provide for a "Zombie Cinema gamer community" when I publish my zombie game at Gencon; who would have any use for something like that? My game is content enough for one discussion, and that's that; it's not intended to occupy your free time for months at a time, and certainly nobody should stop playing D&amp;D just so they can start playing my game full time. There simply are not enough basic reasons for facilitating a community around my game, when there is no call for such community. The important thing to realize is that this is not a failure for the game; just as you don't need a community centered around the latest Hollywood blockbuster movie (I certainly hope you don't, anyway; I manage to consume movies well enough without joining a Google Group dedicated to fawning over that particular movie), you don't need a community for each individual game you play, either.<br/><br/>Games and companies are of course different in this regard, so community features are a smart solution for some while not being so for others. For example, I run my own Finnish indie rpg community at our Finnish website, forums and all: this makes sense because "interested in experimental indie games" is wide enough an identity issue as to provide for some sensible basis for community. (All the more so when we publish a game or two a year in Finnish, meaning that it's not a forum for a single game, but for many, even discounting all the English-language games out there.) Comparing this to single-title publishers who insist on having a forum makes the difference clear: several Finnish rpg designers insist or insisted on having a forum when they published their first games, which means that there are half a dozen outright abandoned, small, rpg specialty forums out there in the internets. A pretty sad sight, and mostly wasted energy for those designers whose games are actually discussed much more actively at general interest sites.<br/><br/>So my message is, simply enough, that making a game and making a community are separate endeavours, which you might wish to combine when the benefits are big enough. But having a community is certainly not de rigueur any more than having your own letter-head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157226/#Comment_157226" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T13:57:57+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  1:57PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just like to point out that for the majority of indie/small-press games I own, I'm more likely to post questions/comments about the game on a site like this than I am to try to do so at the author/publisher's own site.
