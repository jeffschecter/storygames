It's a Pbta game that incorporates advancement through beliefs, a debt system, tags used to make futuristic tech as well as cybernetics - and a lot more! We've got the playtesting docs up and a very rough first draft  available for free so even if you don't back it, feel free to drop me a line with some feedback. It's the first game I've designed and seems like this is an amazing resource for designers. I've seen Andy on here and his stuff is amazing, so any feedback is appreciated. <br/><br/><br/>The thing I'm most excited about is having your stats as your emotions, during playtesting it really anchored the players in the fiction. <br/>I incorporated a burning wheel style of beliefs and made that the advancement for the game as well as coupling it with getting XP for failing. <br/>I've incorporated a debt system for Giri - a fairly big thing in cyberpunk roughly translated to meaning a duty or obligation you're bound to. <br/>Used tags to do cybernetics as well as create new types of tech and weapons.<br/>Playbooks bring a lot of fiction with them.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samjokopublishing/the-veil-cyberpunk-rpg/comments" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samjokopublishing/the-veil-cyberpunk-rpg/comments</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458772/#Comment_458772" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-20T17:05:15+00:00" title="December 20, 2016  5:05PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone played this?
