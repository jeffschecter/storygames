You need something that's narrowly focussed, that'll take you by the hand and guide you along to a specific way of playing.<br/><br/>Later, when you're familiar with the form and start understanding yourself and what you can do, that's when you need to pick up the broad games. Then you'll have the skills to make the broad games produce the kind of play you like.<br/><br/>(I think there's a lot of sense in this reversed version, actually. Better to start with a narrow game like Contenders, with which it's hard to go wrong, than something like The Shadow Of Yesterday, which requires specific skills like storytelling and stakesetting.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120313/#Comment_120313" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T04:17:07+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  4:17AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contenders is exactly the game I had in mind, Gee-Dubya. <br/><br/>A friend's first two games were an hour of Contenders and an hour of Best Friends.

Once they have seen that gaming is fun (through the tightly focussed play they experience first) they should have room to explore. After all they could turn out to be a gamist, or a narrativist, or a hack and slasher, or a born storyteller, or whatever. They can't pick the right game for them, though, without knowing what those different stances are like and making a choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120350/#Comment_120350" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T07:15:54+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  7:15AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2008 7:52AM by Andy.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>The answer is that a lot of the time a game's design doesn't matter very much except to the degree it can provide elements that a particular player can intuitively attach herself to.

Might want to be careful here, though: If you fall off that misplaced soapbox, you might bruise a knee.<br/><br/>I'm spot on with the rest of your points, though. They pretty much reinforce the original post: Maybe keeping to games that provide all sorts of elements that one can attach to. Then, later, perhaps moving on to a fine-tuned game. I'm full in agreement though that the game itself is not going to dominate the players into playing it as intended like some miniature God, but a fine-tuned (read: "hippy") game could be a good, I dunno, pointer in a particular direction once people find out what they do and do not tend to like.  Like playing the IMAGINE RPG system, vs My Life With Master.  For a new player, depending on what I know about them, I'd rather run IMAGINE* for them than MLWM (unless I have that spot-on feeling upon really knowing a person, that they would totally love the latter).<br/><br/>If Jenny's eyes light up during combat, I'd probably play The Riddle of Steel or the J-RPG Gundog (read: "The Riddle of Steel, but towards guns rather than swords") with her. If Jayce is a local theater buff and seems in the zone when he's roleplaying in character at the Big Fantasy Ball, then I'd probably play AMBER or PTA with him. If I wanted to play with them all at the same time, I'd probably play something that isn't focused, like Shadowrun or whatever, and try to meet everyone's needs in turn.  This is actually what we're doing with Eric P's Sombra Console SR hack, and it's working really well.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>*footnote: IMAGINE sucks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120366/#Comment_120366" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T09:01:52+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  9:01AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2008 9:02AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>A position to discuss:<br/><br/>The first time you play a role-playing game, you don't know what you want.

I started with blue book D&amp;D--lots of choice, but "ratcheting" complexity thanks to class levels. After playing a bit with the "old guys" at the hobby store (I realize now they were prolly all in their early twenties), I was the DM for games with family and friends.<br/><br/>Now, I'd suggest that DMing something even as simple as OD&amp;D is not exactly as "streamlined" or "narrow" or "point and shoot" as games like <i>Contenders</i>. So am I a special talent or intellect... or did I have to spend some time reading, thinking, and practicing?<br/><br/>As much as I like a punchy, straight-forward system and setting to hook "newbies" or low-attention-span punters at a convention, I think it's a disservice to, well, humanity, to presume we Wise Ones must design (or direct play to) games that hold the new player's hand. Sure, folks who at heart don't really give a damn about this "storytelling, imaginative" pastime aren't going to sit still for the explication a game like Hero requires. But do we really need a thread discussing The Right Way to present a "game for beginners?"<br/><br/>Put another way... choose a different term than "beginners," or this thread is bound to degenerate into "nu-uh," "uh-HUH" gyres. Do you mean "probably disinterested person"? Do you mean "very young and easily distracted person"? Do you mean "our wives who roll their eyes at our shenanigans and jargon?" Do you mean "a person who's never played any kind of game before at all, be it board game or let's pretend or poker?" WTF is a "beginner" and what makes them so much gimpier than I was at 8 years old, that they can't read a book and do some math and let trial and error point them to the "right" way to play a complex game?<br/><br/>(Ugh...

Ideally, a new player can look in the rulebook, see the rules and know what to expect from the game.<br/>\n3) Specific roles, It should be clear what the characters are supposed to be doing in the setting.<br/>\n  Now technically, a lot of games meet this criteria (D&amp;D, Exalted, SoY and InSpectres), but I think that other games fall flat for new gamers. GURPS straight out of the box or "The Pool" are a good examples of games I would not subject new players to. Not because they are bad games, but because of the whole "paralysis of choice" phenomenon. I've seen seasoned gamers paralyzed by too much choice, why would I subject someone that I am trying to teach good RP'ing to that?<br/>\n  I guess to me a beginner is a special class of gamer, not because I don't trust their knowledge, experience or abilities, but because, to me, its a chance to teach them how not to make some of the mistakes I made. Of course they will make their own mistakes, and hopefully, they will learn from them. But more importantly, I can say, "don't drive down that alley, its a dead end." And maybe make their gaming experience a little more fun...<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nAuthor of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120390/#Comment_120390" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T10:43:16+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 10:43AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>GURPS straight out of the box or "The Pool" are a good examples of games I would not subject new players to.</blockquote>\nCounterpoints, since we're all about that here -- GURPS was my first RPG experience, around 11 or 12 years ago.<br/><br/>The first time I played GURPS, I was handed a character sheet, told what the adventure was about (we were playing in GURPS Robin Hood), and I never had to look up a rule in the book.  It was a pretty friendly RPG experience, and is why I keep doing it today.  I played GURPS exclusively for a couple years after that before getting experienced to D&amp;D for the first time.<br/><br/>I think some folks here are lumping a focused/broad <em>RPG</em> in the same category as a focused/broad <em>experience</em>.  A focused experience combined with a broad game I knew well enough to not look up rules in the book would be my ideal "introducing a person to the hobby" scenario.  Keeping them in their comfort zone for that first experience would be my main concern, so any setup that requires a degree of system mastery or a great degree of narration rights is out.  (Some people might really be taken with the latter, but I'd like to find that out first by seeing how they react before handing them that bag of tricks -- that's where your Paradox of Choice I think really hits home.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Better to start with a narrow game like Contenders, with which it's hard to go wrong</blockquote>\nI wouldn't start with a game like Contenders, mainly because it relies on all players having some GM skill (as most "GMless" games do).  But, that raises a curiosity for me:  I know that some folks who have had long-time experiences with broad systems have the narrow ones to be constraining and confusing.  I wonder how someone who has only played narrow-focused systems would react when suddenly presented with a broad system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120394/#Comment_120394" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T10:51:07+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 10:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to be too difficult, but what about folks who drive down the dead-end alley and find, while turning around, an interesting dive bar?<br/><br/>OK, ok, enough metaphor: I am (dimly) championing the notion of Allow Beginners To Struggle. Suppose they gain insight into the setting and system *faster* by wading through complexity or broad choice or an odd setting? Conversely, suppose an experienced, guiding hand ends up putting blinders on the beginner, by firmly directing him or her to The Right Way to play this (or all) game(s)?<br/><br/>What if a concrete, directed RPG leaves a bad taste and, as such, sullies the name of all RPGs in a way that a more open RPG would not have, because it provides alternatives? Or suppose someone playing in a "commonly known" setting doesn't "get" the game's hooks and finds the RPG experience to be inferior to the passive entertainment experience of just watching the original IP?<br/><br/>Finally, I sincerely reject the notion that "Play Pretend + Structure" is a "rare combination." Why? Well, looking back on my own past, I can think of scores and scores of instances where the two combine, though not in the "roll a die and check a chart" manner. Simple negotiation of legitimate scope and "proper play," and trading or resource allocation, are HUGE aspects of Let's Pretend... and of many RPGs. "Let's play cops and robbers, but you can't leave these two blocks and the robbers get a count of 100 to find hideouts before the cops can come looking." And, further, don't forget the TONS of Structure that pervades other forms of play, like sports or even going to the playground. You learn to take turns, you learn to "play fair," you learn procedures and special cases and....<br/><br/>So, OK, *in combination* they don't come together much outside of RPGs or stage acting; but (again) I think it's a bit unfair or even elitist to suggest that such combining somehow will frazzle or short-out the mind of a "beginner" to gaming, or will necessarily drive them away from gaming. I bet I could go up to almost anyone over the age of about 8 years old and describe 90% of RPGs as "well, you know how sometimes when you play pretend you get into arguments about who did what first, or what's 'fair' to do when you're playing? OK, in RPGs, we have rules and some other stuff like dice or cards which help us fairly resolve such arguments before they even start. Wanna play?"<br/><br/>Again, I entreat this thread's participants to define "beginner" in a manner that provides a clear association between (a) such an individual's shortcomings which require hand-holding to get at GoodRightFun and (b) solid, pedagogical notions of how to deal with each of such an individual's limitations. Such info--far more than anecdotes and opinions about what's The Right Way to design and write for a nebulously defined class of entities--would be a solid springboard for designers and writers trying to target particular "classes" of RPG users.<br/><br/>My 2\xa2 (worth 0.005 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amero" rel="nofollow">Ameroes</a>, at 2014 currency exchange prices);<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120399/#Comment_120399" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T11:08:13+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 11:08AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>GURPS straight out of the box</blockquote>\nHuh.

I don't think that a new gamer cannot understand complex games or broadly focused games at all. Surely, RPGs had to start somewhere so obviously those guys didn't have a mentor to guide them through the experience. And many people buy the book before they find a group and learn it that way.<br/>\n  But, many RPGamers come to it through a group. Whether they see a group of guys and want to join or one of the members  invites them to a session, whatever.<br/>\n  In this mode, there is a lot of things that a new gamer has to decode. Anything a game designer/GM can do to make that experience easier is better for the hobby in my opinion.<br/>\n  Of course there are going to be people that get carried away and make grown men play Shadows (not that there is anything wrong with Shadows, it is just not a system requirement to introducing people to RPGs) as written. And of course there are going to be GMs that throw their players into the deep end of some tediously complex game (not that any tediously complex game has been mentioned in this thread), cuz they played it when they were a kid.<br/>\n  But for the rest of us, it might be a good idea to throw out some techniques that might help ease a new player into a new experience (roleplaying).<br/>\n  And I don't think anyone in this thread imagines a utopia in which new players (with or without guidance) doesn't make mistakes (big or small). That I think is unavoidable. There is a lot that goes into the skill of roleplaying. It is a learning process that sometimes seems to never end. But it seems to me that to not even attempt to impart some skill/knowledge/experience on a new gamer is as much of a disservice as putting the blinders on and only allowing them to play the "right way"...<br/>\n  As to defining what a new player is, that seems like a needless requirement, we have all been a new player at some point in our life (assuming you have actually played RPGs and not just read the books). What were some things that if you knew it then, it would have made the experience more fun for you?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120425/#Comment_120425" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T12:11:14+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 12:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><br/>So, OK, *in combination* they don't come together much outside of RPGs or stage acting; but (again) I think it's a bit unfair or even elitist to suggest that such combining somehow will frazzle or short-out the mind of a "beginner" to gaming, or will necessarily drive them away from gaming.

Might want to be careful here, though: If you fall off that misplaced soapbox, you might bruise a knee.</blockquote>\nI wish I could say that this observation isn't integral to the matter at hand, but it is. Forge theory is dismissive of many working playstyles and says they're either incoherent or the players are lying to themselves. This is a necessary gambit, because the basis of current theory makes claim for the importance of system that is so strong that contraindicating evidence don't work.<br/><br/>In our thread right now, the basic assumption is that the system imposes its structures on the players utterly, and that if it fails to do so, it fails, period. This fallacious thinking is inherited from bad theory. It's obviously bad theory because people keep spontaneously picking up and playing D&amp;D and Vampire. <br/><br/>By questioning this, Mathijs put himself into the line of fire. The accessibility of the games he describes is true, because these games are in fact successful. Colour alone isn't doing it -- if it was, people would just write fanfic (and often do -- fanfic based play is probably  the fastest-growing noncommercial roleplaying form, and the failure of the game-think crowd to come to grips with it is telling).<br/><br/>My point isn't that there's setting and art and such to attract people. My point is that the game system is often irrelevant to the success of a game because of the limits of how game design can influence players. These limits are easily identifiable as systemic, semiotic and social and are not a vague assertion that "Everybody's different, maaaan."<br/><br/>In my view, modern traditional RPGs are appealing because their systems and built in a nested hierarchy -- and are a bit baroque, to boot. This means that the rules can accommodate simplification and failure modes based on getting things wrong and still provide play. I came to believe this after observing D&amp;D games as a third party as part of intentional, personal research and observing that play groups *rarely* adhere to the rules as written, even when they *believe* they do. But D&amp;D is robust, in that you can screw it up but still roll dice against a DC and get a decent outcome. This puts the details of game instances into players' hands. You can use the complex system for, say, computer hacking in D20 Modern, but you can also mandate a DC 15 and leave it at that.<br/><br/>It' been my experience that players choose the level of detail and rules style they want in an asymmetric fashion. They guy who plays the wheelman wants to use the chase rules; the master of disguise does not, but wants to delve into the social mechanics. The failure to discuss this asymmetry is a major problem in GMing advice, and th failure to identify nested systems is a big problem is theory.\n<blockquote>I'm spot on with the rest of your points, though. They pretty much reinforce the original post: Maybe keeping to games that provide all sorts of elements that one can attach to. Then, later, perhaps moving on to a fine-tuned game. I'm full in agreement though that the game itself is not going to dominate the players into playing it as intended like some miniature God, but a fine-tuned (read: "hippy") game could be a good, I dunno, pointer in a particular direction once people find out what they do and do not tend to like.  Like playing the IMAGINE RPG system, vs My Life With Master.  For a new player, depending on what I know about them, I'd rather run IMAGINE* for them than MLWM (unless I have that spot-on feeling upon really knowing a person, that they would totally love the latter).<br/><br/>If Jenny's eyes light up during combat, I'd probably play The Riddle of Steel or the J-RPG Gundog (read: "The Riddle of Steel, but towards guns rather than swords") with her. If Jayce is a local theater buff and seems in the zone when he's roleplaying in character at the Big Fantasy Ball, then I'd probably play AMBER or PTA with him. If I wanted to play with them all at the same time, I'd probably play something that isn't focused, like Shadowrun or whatever, and try to meet everyone's needs in turn.  This is actually what we're doing with Eric P's Sombra Console SR hack, and it's working really well.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>*footnote: IMAGINE sucks.</blockquote>\nI think it's a mistake to believe that one "matures" into a focused system. Finding hooks and exploring them with different degrees of commitment is not a beginner's stance. It's a constant part of the roleplaying process and deserves support. This is not to say that focused systems are entire bad, but they are not solutions or the "next level" in any way, shape or form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120517/#Comment_120517" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T19:01:45+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  7:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><br/><br/>The obvious retort to this is "D&amp;D first edition".

'Player training' is all the rage - it's most evident in the Half-Life series: Present the players with a limited set of tools and options, let them master the basics, then layer on the complexity (and up the challenge) as the game progresses until they have mastered the game as a whole.  For example, you're not given the Gravity Gun until about halfway through HL2, because you're mastering things like interacting with the environment and basic combat skills.<br/><br/>I believe the same thing is valuable with RPGs.  Start with just some basic mechanics and procedures, then layer on new ones as the players get comfortable.  Even with euro-style boardgames, extra procedures can be daunting to new players.  The wife and I have started really exploring them with gusto, and things like hidden information, strategic trading and the like take some getting used to for her.<br/><br/>One thing that I find interesting is that there's an either/or dynamic in play with RPGs.  Either you have a very simple game, mechanically speaking, which shifts the burden of narrative onto the players; or you have a mechanically complex game that may provide more support for new players to make choices (given all of the tools they have arrayed on their character sheet) - but there aren't games that do both.  There's no basic/advanced versions of Nine Worlds or PTA.  <br/><br/>One of the things I'm trying to do with <i>DEAD</i> is find a way to scaffold in the roleplaying elements.  As is, you can play <i>DEAD</i> solely as a card game, with no roleplay required.  But then I have included rules for shifting the play away from the cards, so to speak, and to fall into a much looser, narrative style of play.  <br/><br/>In the case of <i>DEAD</i>, I'm acquainting the players with the mechanical side of the game first, then offering support for a more narrative style of play.  A more narrative game might include additional mechanical supports for new players who may not be master storytellers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120537/#Comment_120537" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T21:48:02+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  9:48PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite><br/>Yet people still play it.</blockquote>\nAnd I wonder how many of those, are people new to roleplaying?<br/><br/>I've seen the odd 1E player.

RPGs are not a technology that expresses itself through linear progression. It can't, because entertainment is not the same thing as moving bits and is not quantifiable in the same sense at all. Of course, the funny thing is that people copying earlier technology is in fact a growth area in video game development, because emulating them leads to highly portable applications. It's the characteristics of the technology in context, not a crude assertion of sophistication, that determines its utility.

You do, so I don't. The indictments are constant. Between things like <i>brain damage</i> and Knife Fight discussions comparing conventional play to spousal battery, it happens over and over again.<br/><br/>I mean, fuck: The theory definition of play outside theory is called <i>zilch</i>play. It is not accepted into the canon. Instead a technical term was developed that redefines it as a *lack* of play. It also indicates that people don't really take the Lumpley Principle's definition seriously, because "zilchplay" obviously has an LP-defined "system," but is not counted as play. The idea that one can operate a game system without playing it is self-evidently stupid, so these two theory constructions are contradictory. <br/><br/>Again, this is relevant to the thread because these assumptions are the basis of the shitty advice often bandied about. As long as players are considered the incidental subjects of a game who can be coerced by a sufficiently well-designed system, the advice will continue to be shitty. The other half of this -- using extra-ludic social force to keep players in line -- has been critiqued for ages. Shrinking the scope of a system to force obedience to a type of play is at least as awful -- perhaps more so, because there's no living person to come to terms with, just a text.<br/><br/>An accessible game design is flexible on multiple fronts: systemic (can be tuned to a player on an instance by instance basis), semiotic (what game elements mean can be changed and played with without too much trouble) and social (the procedures and player relationships can shift quite a bit within default functional roles). This is anathema to the focused designs that arise from the centrality of CA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120550/#Comment_120550" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T00:53:19+00:00" title="January 19, 2008 12:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>One thing that White Wolf did was to make stripped-down versions of the system for quickstart play.

It is not accepted into the canon. Instead a technical term was developed that redefines it as a *lack* of play. It also indicates that people don't really take the Lumpley Principle's definition seriously, because "zilchplay" obviously has an LP-defined "system," but is not counted as play. The idea that one can operate a game system without playing it is self-evidently stupid, so these two theory constructions are contradictory.<br/><br/>Again, this is relevant to the thread because these assumptions are the basis of the shitty advice often bandied about. As long as players are considered the incidental subjects of a game who can be coerced by a sufficiently well-designed system, the advice will continue to be shitty. The other half of this -- using extra-ludic social force to keep players in line -- has been critiqued for ages. Shrinking the scope of a system to force obedience to a type of play is at least as awful -- perhaps more so, because there's no living person to come to terms with, just a text.</blockquote>\nWow.

You get a "choose your own adventure" kind of thing to at least give you a basic idea of some aspects of play, before you actually have to play with other folks.<br/><br/>In fact, most people actually do this when they're teaching a new rpg to a group- they'll usually go over the basics and then... run a fight scene or two.   And what's a fight scene if not a pretty simplistic goal based bit of play?  You see this in the classic "protect the caravan from bandits" scenario to the Shadowrun convenience store shootout.  (see: Dogs in the Vineyard's Initiations for a systemic approach to this)<br/><br/>You'll also see many players self select in the same way- if there's a character type that engages a complicated sub-system (magic, hacking, whatever) they'll avoid it until they learn the basics of the game because it's another layer of complexity.<br/><br/>All of this behavior, though, comes from folks who are experienced roleplayers- they're used to having to build their own teaching/learning tools.  A non-gamer will just as often choose the most complicated options without an understanding of -how much more- complicated it could/will be, if only because in their world- games work generally the same way, while in rpgs, the rule of the subsystem and exception based rules often applies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120596/#Comment_120596" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T09:48:33+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  9:48AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite>I think<a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/srd/perfect20/Perfect20_2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">Perfect20</a>is about as close as the stripped-down version have come to a truly introductory d20.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah...a "path" from Perfect20 to the "full" d20 is what's missing.

The magic system working like the combat system, which is like the situation-generation system.  Certainly there can be tweaks and new twists to learn, but making the advanced portions just more ornamented versions of the basic mechanical structure of the game is a good idea.  That's what always got me about D&amp;D - the magic system and the save system and the ability system were all different, mechanically.

The discussion was talking about something else entirely. You found a hole that you could fill with your grudge against the theory, and you did so. The only person who started framing this discussion into Forge terms, bringing up the Big Model, Zilchplay and shit like that was you. Even after that, people managed to continue the discussion without going to Forge-land, until some others come in to refute you (poorly so).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite><br/>In our thread right now, the basic assumption is that the system imposes its structures on the players utterly, and that if it fails to do so, it fails, period. <b>This fallacious thinking is inherited from bad theory</b>. It's obviously bad theory because people keep spontaneously picking up and playing D&amp;D and Vampire.</blockquote>\nSure, Forge Theory is Bad Theory... but again, this is not a Forge Theory thread. There's no reason to bring that crap out here. We don't have to say "Lumpley Principle" or "Czege Whatever" to talk about the subject, but that's the first place you reach, in order to bodyslam some old arguments you have a beef with.\n<blockquote>By questioning this, Mathijs put himself into the line of fire.</blockquote>\nMathijs put himself in the line of a dozen people all nodding their heads in agreement, offering complimentary or conflicting ideas that don't spring from "What I learned from discussion at The Forge". \n<blockquote>You could have answered my discussion on LP and zilchplay, but the intellectual limitations at work here are such that you cannot even *cite* it.</blockquote>\nIf you want to argue Forge Theory, do it on the Forge. Or your blog. This site might happen to attract folks who have bought into the theory, but it's not a safe ground for theory talk, sycophantic theory group-hugs or theory deconstruction. That stuff is for elsewhere. Where? I don't know. But not here.\n<blockquote>That tells me a lot about what you have to offer, really.</blockquote>\nPart in parcel to your behavior:<br/><br/>1) Find a thread with room enough to whip out your soapbox, and bypass the topic in discussion in order to bring up some old thing someone said that you have a grudge against.<br/>2) Fish for respondents. Agitate them. Focus the discussion in a "wave arms to attract attention" matter on your pet side-point with Forge Theory, rather than the original topic.<br/>3) Prove that your grudge is justified, if only to yourself.<br/>4) Then going back to decent, thoughtful posting until the next chance to air an old grudge comes to light.<br/>5) Rinse; repeat.<br/><br/>So, I guess the problem comes down to this.<br/><br/>You have a grudge against Forge Theory. Fine.<br/>You have a grudge against Ron Edwards for terms like "Zilchplay". Fine.<br/>You have a grudge against Chris Chinn for stuff he wrote on his blog three years ago. Fine.<br/>You have a grudge against Kuma for shit he did on RPGNet five years ago. OK.<br/>You have a grudge against Knife Fight. Gotcha.<br/>You have a grudge against TonyLB for something he did on another forum, and thus take shots at him whenever you can. I see.<br/>You have a grudge against "the shitty advice often bandied about"... which was bandied about Not Here, but on people's blogs, The Forge, or wherever. Sure.<br/>The list goes on. We understand.<br/><br/>Hell, I have grudges, too. Though I've learned over time that they basically amount to nothing, and keep them from directing me to scream stuff on forums, or publicly rant where it's not needed.<br/>Others here have grudges. For the most part, they keep them in their pants. When they just for the life of them can't keep the grudges in their pants, and pull them out to use as clubs, that's when I need to step in. Especially in the middle of threads,but threads started to push a grudge (read the "Why RPGNet/Why TheRPGSite?" threads), it's time to knock that shit off.<br/><br/>People say, "Don't mess with the Zen!" What is "the Zen", anyway?<br/><br/>The Zen isn't a condition which maintains the sycophantic Forgespeak community by making sure nothing is ever questioned. In fact, I've locked down discussions on the few occasions where people were having a normal conversation, which was then upturned by one or two people dropping Big Model discussion in a disingenuous way to steer/"Win" the discussion.<br/>The Zen is making sure that, when it comes to talking about something in this place, that you can do so without being driven to act knee-jerk based on some old grudge that happened elsewhere, years ago. That's how, here in this place, RPGnet folks can talk to Forge hippie gamers and Traditional Gamers, without constantly going at each others' throats.<br/><br/>So right now, you're tea-bagging the conventions of this cite which allow people to talk to each other without falling back into jargon, and without having to relive old grudges, pains, mistakes from other places or from years ago.<br/><b><br/><span style="color: #FF00CC;">To that end: No more Forge discussion from you in threads where someone hasn't already brought it up.  If someone points at another and shoots them down referencing some specific theory/big model word, fine, <i>engage</i>.<br/>But no more soapbox in places where it doesn't belong. If you have a point to make, do so without dragging in Ron Edwards/Forge Theory.<br/>If you have a "<a href="http://www.stefanmart.de/13_midas/130e_midas.htm" rel="nofollow">The King has Donkey's Ears</a>" moment and you just can't seem to keep it in, take it somewhere else. To your blog, to wherever.<br/>You're only permitted to discuss your take on Forge Theory in threads that specifically refer to it: Where someone else has already brought up Zilchplay or whatever, you're free to give your take on it if its relevant to the discussion.<br/>If you're looking to systematically refute every point of whatever ("Big Model"? I don't even know which is which myself anymore) you need to do it elsewhere.</span></b><br/><br/>And please, for your own benefit stop dwelling on grudges from the past. Pretend nothing happened before 2007, if it helps.

The magic system working like the combat system, which is like the situation-generation system.  Certainly there can be tweaks and new twists to learn, but making the advanced portions just more ornamented versions of the basic mechanical structure of the game is a good idea.  That's what always got me about D&amp;D - the magic system and the save system and the ability system were all different, mechanically.  And this is still true, to an extent: the magic system is still not attached to the rest of the system, except tangentially.</blockquote>\nI tend to propose another rule of thumb: <i>If you put two things in your game, make them completely the same or completely different.</i><br/><br/>So, in D&amp;D, for attacks you need to roll. For spells you don't. They always have some effect, but you only got so many of them.<br/><br/>If D&amp;D had been like that, it would have been OK. It just isn't. Because you still might need to make a caster level check or a ranged touch attack or the opponent gets a saving throw that negates the spell.<br/><br/>I hear in 4E they are going the other way, making every class work the same: Every one must roll and some effects (combat techniques, spells etc.) can only be used so often. Now that's fine, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120705/#Comment_120705" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T08:11:14+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  8:11AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2008 8:11AM by Mark W.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Fine-tuned"? Probably not. I think there's good argument for clear, specific, and consistent, but not "does only one thing, and that only if used exactly as directed." Not that that <b>can't</b> work, but that it's not likely to build portable skills and it's only going to "hook" people who are looking for that specific experience.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I really do think that the "blob of non-specific stuff, find your game in the blob" approach is pretty tough. It selects for the people who enjoy the process of sifting their thing out of the blob - which gives you a hobby full of (but not solely composed of) somewhat obsessive tinkerers and Serious Fans who will put up with/ignore a lot of cruft to get the thing they want.<br/><br/>My postulates are pretty much<br/><br/>1. The text informs play.<br/>2. Play never perfectly replicates the text.<br/>3. What people want the game to be about trumps what the text wants it to be about.<br/>4. But, tension between text and people creates stress and increases the potential for "blah" or unpleasant experiences.<br/><br/>Given that, it's probably a good idea to minimize that stress. The two most straightforward ways to do that are either<br/><br/>1. Throw up you hands and try not to be prescriptive at all about the game's content. Give tools that are generally useful and let people build their own game out of them.<br/>2. Be really specific about what the tools in the text are, and what they work well for. Trust people to pick the game based on the experience it says it delivers, and do your best to deliver it.<br/><br/>Historically, published games have either done <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> or just CLAIMED to do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, counting on the hacker culture to cover for a lot. There've also been a fair number of games that tried <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, but in many cases the tools for delivering the promised play experience were based more on an assumed set of play culture and soft skills that weren't actually IN the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120720/#Comment_120720" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T09:10:44+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  9:10AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Mark said.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that for me, the first rpg I "encountered" was white box D&amp;D, when an older cousin tossed it my way.  I couldn't for the life of me figure out how the game was supposed to work.  I had some cool dice, some neat pictures, a map, and no fucking clue how it fit together.   It wasn't until I picked up Red box, which gave directions on how to play, that it made sense for me.   A newer friend of mine related how he loved the Vampire books, but never got into playing because he couldn't figure out how it translated to play on his own.   <br/><br/>Is this a common story?  Probably not in our circles, at least, because our hobby has been built on people mentoring others in, to cover the gaps in the text.<br/><br/>But there's this interesting thing- Red Box taught me map based play, TMNT taught me illusionist play.  While neither of these was fully fulfilling, it was entertaining enough to keep me interested in the hobby long enough to find more.  Even if it wasn't the optimal form of play for me, it was a form of play, and that was better than nothing in terms of someone self-teaching from the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120725/#Comment_120725" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T10:05:41+00:00" title="January 20, 2008 10:05AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>What's interesting is that for me, the first rpg I "encountered" was white box D&amp;D, when an older cousin tossed it my way.

This means that the rules can accommodate simplification and failure modes based on getting things wrong and still provide play. I came to believe this after observing D&amp;D games as a third party as part of intentional, personal research and observing that play groups *rarely* adhere to the rules as written, even when they *believe* they do. But D&amp;D is robust, in that you can screw it up but still roll dice against a DC and get a decent outcome. This puts the details of game instances into players' hands. You can use the complex system for, say, computer hacking in D20 Modern, but you can also mandate a DC 15 and leave it at that.</blockquote>\nOk. But Malcolm, if a traditional game works well because there's an easy to grasp core that works, why play with all the bells and whistles? Why not just play with that core? Speaking strictly about first time players here. Why not just play something that is simple to begin with (Formless comes to mind here; someone else mentioned perfect20, although I've never read or played it so I have no idea how simple it is)? Where the core is the game.<br/><br/>Especially because, well, people don't adhere to the rules of Monopoly (while believing they are), and that's a simple game with brief rules.<br/><br/>EDIT: Added

There wasn't anything hinting at the idea you might do anything besides that in the game.<br/><br/>So far, my experience has been even when you have a newbie brought into an experienced group with broad, undirected game, the newbie gets to experience -that group's- style of play, which is usually one style, not a variety amongst the ways you -could- play a broad game... in which case, the newbie still doesn't get a chance to choose from a variety of styles, but instead simply learns, "This is how you play X" until playing with a lot more people and maybe coming across other styles.<br/><br/>If the group they're with tends to play -everything- the same way, then often the new person then decides, "This is how you roleplay" for all games.  (A couple months back I'm play testing a friend's game all about cultural struggles and identity, and one player goes into this "I hide in a cave and set up traps and have escape exits..."etc. mode, which, is completely incongruous with the game, but, he sees it as the way all games get played...)<br/><br/>So, I mean, I suppose one could design a game with different "modes"- or examples showing how you could do X with it or Y with it, though pretty much the only two games that come to mind as giving that advice are D&amp;D 3.X (with maps vs. preplotted adventures) and Burning Wheel's The Blossoms Are Falling (with explicit customization for different types of games from courtly intrigue to warfare).<br/><br/>Though neither of these games I look at and imagine someone is teaching themselves from the text as a complete newbie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121032/#Comment_121032" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T14:20:40+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:20PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2008 2:20PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>So, I mean, I suppose one could design a game with different "modes"- or examples showing how you could do X with it or Y with it, though pretty much the only two games that come to mind as giving that advice are D&amp;D 3.X (with maps vs. preplotted adventures) and Burning Wheel's The Blossoms Are Falling (with explicit customization for different types of games from courtly intrigue to warfare).</blockquote>\nHoard - game I'm just putting out there now - does a LOT of this.

I went into a local game shop and asked what was "new."  I think I left with the first edition of Werewolf.  We played it the same as D&amp;D.;  It had all the same stuff.  It had all the rules to play it exactly the same way.  It "worked."  The game text might have talked about notions like making profound stories, but the rules were just a different D&amp;D.;  We enjoyed it.  It was like playing a super hero game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think I disagree with the original post.  I think if the rules and the goals of the game had been specifically fine tuned to accomplished the stated goals, it might have provided the means to play something "new" rather than D&amp;D; or super heroes with a different veiner.  Everyone goes into gaming with some preconceived notions.  I think many of todays preconceived notions might be born out of contact with computer RPGs.  Just as we brought our D&amp;D; notions, perhaps new gamers today bring a World of Warcraft notion or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think basic red box D&amp;D; did a very good job of narrowly focusing the attention of new players into a specific mode of play.  If other games after had been so strong in a presentation of their focus (and had rules aligned with that focus instead of opposed to it) then they might have had the same effect of producing "This is how you roleplay" or at the very least, enabling players to not carry the strongly presented mode of D&amp;D; into other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it's been too long and I'm out of touch with how new gamers think though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121116/#Comment_121116" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T19:36:45+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  7:36PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>In my view, modern traditional RPGs are appealing because their systems and built in a nested hierarchy -- and are a bit baroque, to boot. This means that the rules can accommodate simplification and failure modes based on getting things wrong and still provide play. I came to believe this after observing D&amp;D games as a third party as part of intentional, personal research and observing that play groups *rarely* adhere to the rules as written, even when they *believe* they do. But D&amp;D is robust, in that you can screw it up but still roll dice against a DC and get a decent outcome. This puts the details of game instances into players' hands. You can use the complex system for, say, computer hacking in D20 Modern, but you can also mandate a DC 15 and leave it at that.</blockquote>\nOk. But Malcolm, if a traditional game works well because there's an easy to grasp core that works, why play with all the bells and whistles? Why not just play with that core? Speaking strictly about first time players here. Why not just play something that is simple to begin with (Formless comes to mind here; someone else mentioned perfect20, although I've never read or played it so I have no idea how simple it is)?

R. Talsorian games had a few solid licenses back in the day, but the systems did not produce play that echoed their source material at all.
