It was supposed to go up last summer before GenCon, but alas, life intruded in a lot of really unpleasant ways, including moving, sick and dying pets, and work stress.  BUT it's up NOW.  <br/><br/>So, enjoy. And many, many, many thank yous to Emily for being a wonderful interview.  <a href="http://sirriamnicast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=599210" rel="nofollow">GGR Podcast <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2314&amp;Mode=like">#14</a> - Emily Care Boss</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264718/#Comment_264718" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T14:27:45+00:00" title="March 31, 2010  2:27PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to you! It was great fun to chat.  Glad things have eased up.<br/><br/>Now of course, everyone can start grilling me on whether I subscribe to difference or equality feminism. Or is that an oh so (eek!) 90s argument?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
