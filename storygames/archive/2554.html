Last session, two of the players bowed out. Primarily, personal issues came up which prevented them from continuing with the game. But one of them also told me that they were vagualy dissatisfied with the direction of play, that they felt there hadn't been enough focus on the realtionship between their characters. These two players' characters were indeed linked (intimately so, they only bothered to tell me recently), so I can see the point, however a comment was made which set off warning bells.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo paraphrase, one of these two players said that they spent a lot of time between games talking to each other in character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have ambivelent feelings about this. On one hand its neat that the players were so into their characters that they couldn't wait to play them once a week. But as I see it, during these isolated interactions they were developing ties and expectations that the rest of the group wasn't aware of and thus couldn't participate in or react to. So when these two characters showed up for sessions, they were essentially finding themselves more and more at odds with the rest of the groups expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the future, I'm tempted to speak out against this sort of thing, to decalre that, "if it doesn't happen in the session, it doesn't count," but that seems both draconic and futile. How can I expect to tell people when the are allowed to imagine their characters? Still, I think its ultimately bad for the group.

This wasn't a problem, however, because it was sort of a foregone conclusion that such was happening, and there was a lively community based around posting logs of what had happened in those semiprivate scenes.  The better STs would also ask players to send them short synopses and progress reports on what had happened that week, just to keep them informed.  Which is all to say: there's absolutely nothing dysfunctional about this sort of play; the greater play contract just needs to take it into account -- which means you need a mode of communication and an understanding of the scope of out-of-session roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58754/#Comment_58754" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T11:10:00+00:00" title="March  2, 2007 11:10AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>It sounds like it's also a difference in play styles. They want lots of in-character dialogue, which often winds up a bit freeform. I'm guessing you didn't have much of that during play and tended to focus on things players could roll for. Now, I personally don't like long moments of in-character dialogue or freeform, so my first thought would be to let people who want that experience do it outside the main session and summarize any results they want to affect the rest of the game. But be aware that this might not work.</p>\n<p>It's possible even that the in-character dialogue was secondary. They obviously were spending more time with each other than with the rest of the group. I'm not saying this is a romantic hook-up, but it definitely sounds like the point of play, for them, was to get closer to each other, and the relationship of their characters was a means to that end. The main sessions weren't meeting those needs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58765/#Comment_58765" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T11:51:48+00:00" title="March  2, 2007 11:51AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            E.,<br/><br/>I had something kinda like that happen in a D&amp;D game, though it wasn't as bad.<br/><br/>Here was the crucial difference: it was in the form of written fiction rather than in-character conversation, which the players took to sharing through LiveJournal. So, I think the biggest thing was that nothing was a secret from other players (well, as long as you felt like reading the things). Also, since they were individual fiction rather than conversations, they started off rather introspective; then the players slowly got more comfortable using other characters in their little stories.<br/><br/>The main problem I noticed was that, well, not everyone was on the same page. The two more skillful writers did a really good job riffing off each other with subtle and unobtrusive scenes (a conversation here, a memory there, that kind of thing). Two other players posted a thing or two but generally didn't care for the fiction that much; I got the sense that they were fairly invested in the world but didn't like to be in author stance that much. And the fifth player had a tendency to write scenes that were quite a bit more active and showy, which is what caused some problems. Mostly it was just one thing... there was a point where he wrote up something that made one of the others immediately respond with "No. This is a bad idea. This ruins the thing we all wanted to do in play next week." That certainly made me subconsciously frustrated as GM, because it felt like an attack on the integrity of the shared fiction. He wrote some good stuff, but you could tell that he was reaching for something the system didn't let him do (well, it did let him do it, just clunkily: he had a fairly high-level wizard, so he ended up having his character do nonsensical things that caused character drama to happen, particularly trying to use teleportation to randomly drive scenes around). His fiction did the most to hook in the other characters, but that's why it always seemed forced when he did. Overall, the sense I got was that it wasn't working because there was more of an investment in just plain "story" rather than "our story" on his part. Unsurprisingly, after we finished, that player went and GMed his own game.<br/><br/>I think what kept it together is that, throughout the whole thing, there was a sense that anything folks made up out of game was 90% true rather than 100%: the players encouraged each other to go "Hmm, I'd imagine it happening like this..." or "FYI, the evil knight's name was ______," which really helped ease off the pressure since these didn't feel like unilateral contributions to the shared imagined content. The fact that the first fiction was a joke piece helped that along, I think.<br/><br/>So, hmm, the blog-stories were a mixed blessing. Definitely mildly dysfunctional, but not as bad as the alternative, which, as I was suffering pretty bad GM burnout at the time, would've been a really lackluster game. It was a bit frustrating as the self- (and system-) appointed guardian of the shared imagined content to see people distort it or to see more happen out of play than in play, but, when it worked, it worked. By the end of the campaign, the people who had really gotten into it had basically figured out how to do functional story-driven freeform through just instinct and trial-and-error, which was pretty cool. And that was more or less what got me looking at Narrativist games, so I'm grateful for that.<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58766/#Comment_58766" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T12:02:19+00:00" title="March  2, 2007 12:02PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2007 12:10PM by Alex.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>I'm not saying this is a romantic hook-up, but it definitely sounds like the point of play, for them, was to get closer to each other, and the relationship of their characters was a means to that end.</blockquote>In light of that observation, I feel stupid for leaving this out of my actual play story:<br/><br/>The first two story-writers I mentioned above were, in fact, falling in love. In the context of our social group, it was pretty much only safe way to play around with those feelings.<br/><br/>Yup, that's right, they not only turned D&amp;D into a freeform-ish storytelling gaming, but then used that to explore their real-person feelings in a subtle and mutually/socially non-threatening way. Impressive, huh?<br/><br/><br/>P.S. ... and, I should stop jacking your thread, E. Sorry about that. Suffice it to say, I think there is definitely some kind of strong romance or friendship going on when two players go off to roleplay together all the time.

It's even more true in more decentered and larger-sphere games (MUSHes, LARPs, etc). I've seen LARPs go right to hell because some players play outside game and do so in ways that directly effect the politics in the game. (Such as the Harpy and the Prince spending hours chatting ICly outside of game with the Primogen.) MUSHes where some folks have heavy control over the direction of play for political or social reasons also get into trouble here. <br/><br/>I wonder if this would be equally difficult to deal with in GMless games. Like, a Polaris game where one Heart and his New Moon are constantly flirting IC away from the table could change the game in ways that won't be visible to the other players, but which could become things players expect to be important in play. I mean, a lot of the stuff I said about proper communication applies here as well, but the truth is that works best in a game in which there is a central GM who keeps track of things and acts (at the least) as a central hub for information. In a decentralized information network, individual agents having access to privileged information can be ruinous. <br/><br/>Maybe wikis and the like can take up some of the burden, as a central source to replace the GM, but even then you have the problem of information rather than emotional content being stored.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58789/#Comment_58789" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T13:42:34+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  1:42PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Cautionary note: This is a potential area where differential levels of player commitment can really wreak havoc.</blockquote>\nI've repeatedly noted the obstinance of my group to never come up with new bits of the world as players here. This is similarly true for out-of-game writing. There's really only two players who are willing to do it, one of whom unerringly and without fail hits absolutely false notes that nobody likes.

Especially, if you're going to have multi-session play, then you need a way of dealing with absences.  I think it is common that if someone misses a session, say, then they have more trouble being relevant in the sessions where they do show up.  However, I think that's a deterrent to the less hard-core players, which keeps them away rather than drawing them in.  <br/><br/>If you have a game where someone can shine without having put in a lot of time, then you can not only satisfy them -- but you can have people who do extra role-play, like the extra out-of-game scenes and so forth.  The out-of-game stuff can enhance the game rather than causing problems for it.  <br/><br/>To put it a little more concretely -- Say you've got two players who have a lot of enthusiasm and play scenes outside of the game; and two players who only get involved during the session.  The latter two feel a little shut out by the extra material of the first two, because the former have deeper relationships, more processed personalities, or whatever.  My preferred solution would be to introduce stuff to get the latter two more involved, rather than trying to shut down the former two in an effort to level the playing field.<br/>For example, as GM, I have often taken the least-connected character (i.e. the PC with the fewest hooks, enemies, or whatever) and made them central to the plotline.  So, for example, in Season Two of our Buffy game -- we set up that Roberta was not only made Guardian of an interdimensional nexus, but also the Big Bad was an ex-boyfriend of hers from college.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58804/#Comment_58804" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T14:35:35+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  2:35PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2007 2:39PM by E.T.Smith.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>It's possible even that the in-character dialogue was secondary.

Suffice it to say, I think there is definitely some kind of strong romance or friendship going on when two players go off to roleplay together all the time.

Having talked to them after their leaving, it seems that they wanted to make the unlikely romance between their characters the focus of play (first problem: this is an aspect that the other characters can't participate in, thus by nature it won't be supported by the group). Further setting themselves up for frustration, they never bothered to communicate this desire to the rest of the group or me, the GM, until just before leaving. Rather, they kept hoping for moments of opportunity to happen in the session spontaneously, which were not likely to occur in an action-themed fantasy game. I imagine then they started doing the out-of-session RPing, which only put them at further odds with the group. <br/><br/>In hindsight, their frustration could have been avoided if I had more insistently asked what they wanted play to be about, or if they had thought to mention it to me.

Getting feedback can be tricky both in gaming and many other fields.  There needs to be a space where everyone feels that they can speak openly, and even further that they're <i>expected</i> to do so.  <br/><br/>Something which I've seen in a few games is a debrief where you set aside a block of time, and you go around with everyone adding in a comment.  That isn't a guarantee for everyone to feel relaxed and open about things, though.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>Having talked to them after their leaving, it seems that they wanted to make the unlikely romance between their characters the focus of play (first problem: this is an aspect that the other characters can't participate in, thus by nature it won't be supported by the group).</blockquote>\nYou're making it sound as if this was inherently true of romances, which hasn't been true for my games.  In many games which I have been in, the romances have often involved a lot of the PCs.  For example, in our Buffy game, all of the PCs would frequently conspire to set up their friend Roberta with someone.

Hence the concern about people dominating the game ... and the even more clear hypothetical of people in <i>Polaris</i> essentially using out-of-session play to play scenes without adversity in a way that the rest of the system would never allow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow one could theoretically design a system which is <b>built for</b> distributed play of that sort, so that people playing in out-of-session play and feeding that back into the in-session play would still be taking part in a system that balances people's contributions and power.  But you're not going to get that simply by letting people RP without rules of any sort, then accepting the results of that RP as a done deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn LARP, for instance, the opportunity cost of associating with people during an event is that (a) you're seen associating with them and (b) you spend time that you could be spending with other people.  Out-of-session IC play bypasses both of those, and should justly be seen as unbalancing.  To balance that you might (a) force people to post the fact of their association to a central message board and (b) give them a limited number of hours that they could do such things and have them "count."  That would be a step toward balancing creative input by extending the same give-and-take from the in-session play to the out-of-session play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't really know what the opportunity cost of the two of them chatting at the table and ignoring everyone else (during a session) would be in your game.  Any thoughts?  Is it the kind of thing that could be extended into their out-of-session play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58846/#Comment_58846" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T01:06:44+00:00" title="March  3, 2007  1:06AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, what Tony said about authorial power.<br><br>One problem with between-session scenes is that there's no GM.

There are hundreds of potential scenes that are important, exciting or revelatory, but that don't involve all the players, and that would eat up way too much session time, to the degree that we would spend our games doing nothing but having individual scenes with one another.  Moreover, the vast majority of these mini-scenes don't require the GM -- we're not trying to accomplish anything, we're just indulging in character drama.<br/><br/>I respectfully submit that many of the problems described in this thread are actually issues of social contract.  Sure, minis suck if the entire game is designed to give every player narrative power in every scene.  Yeah, obviously if people are using minis to circumvent the system in order to accomplish difficult tasks, then they're being abused.  But, uh, just like all the examples of line-crossing or assumption breaking play on this and other boards, it has nothing to do with what they're doing and everything to do with what relationships they're screwing up in doing it.  Don't blame the tool for the acts of the craftsman.<br/><br/>I do agree, though, that Brand is right, and that a clear record of what exactly happened is, maybe not absolutely necessary, but extremely valuable and play-improving.  This is another great thing about IRC play.  In games I run, I'd encourage the players to have mini-scenes, both with me and with each other, as long as they're clearly documented, so people know what's going on.  It's good for the game, because I don't want to run "Bob and Carol awkwardly dance around the subject of sex" for an hour and a half while Ted and Alice are trapped under the Jade Mountain and can't participate, but I also don't want to deprive the players of the chance to have the scenes they want to have.  I, uh, probably wouldn't play with people who disrespected social contract in the ways described above, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58877/#Comment_58877" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T12:04:23+00:00" title="March  3, 2007 12:04PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite>I hate between-session scenes.

Because our group does miniscenes regularly (both with and without myself involved), every player has a fairly strong ability to throttle their own amount of spotlight time.

Some minis are run to let a PC interact with an NPC they like a lot; in those cases, obviously, the GM has to be present to play them.  There are some exceptions to this (mostly ones in which, for the purposes of assisting in character drama, some other player runs some mook opposition for us to kill together and thereby bond), but they are extremely rare, and okayed beforehand with everybody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58903/#Comment_58903" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T20:41:31+00:00" title="March  3, 2007  8:41PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2007 9:12PM by E.T.Smith.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Within the common-sense guidelines pointed out so far (ie, no raids on the bank), I agree that out-of-session character interaction isn't a problem, and in fact has a lot of potential for good. However, I think that the last few posts have glossed over a signifivant complication: not all the players have the opportunity (or even inclination) to engage in unmoderated out-of-session play. My particular group is made up of folks who all live in different neighborhoods, work different jobs, generally don't see each other except at the game table and don't have the time to compose long in-character e-mails to one another. The two particular players I mentioned in the opening post were both already personally invested in each other and lived together. The had both a motive and an opportunity to have their characters interact in a way the other players couldn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58904/#Comment_58904" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T20:44:52+00:00" title="March  3, 2007  8:44PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2007 8:46PM by Graham.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, you've got a point.<br/><br/>I'm thinking back to being a Storyteller for a Vampire LARP. Our game was part of an organisation, One World By Night, that linked with other Vampire LARPs by email lists. Players would play scenes on that email list and on IM.<br/><br/>It led to weird situations. You could become powerful in the game by being powerful on the email list: for example, player would turn up with 30 or 40 Status points, loaned to them on the email list, for use in our game.<br/><br/>But what bothered me most was the out-of-session RPing. Players would say "Oh, we played this scene where we robbed banks" or "I flew to Washington DC". Now, if they'd done that in the game itself, there'd have been risk associated with it: I'd have run a scene with them. But because it was in a private scene, they've added something to the game world without risk associated that it could go wrong. <br/><br/>It also led to a situation where you couldn't keep up with the LARP without keeping up with the email. Newcomers to the game were at a disadvantage until they'd found the email game.<br/><br/>So that's what's led to the dislike of out-of-game roleplay. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58907/#Comment_58907" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T21:37:01+00:00" title="March  3, 2007  9:37PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2007 10:29PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes in our games the GM will go off and deal with one or two PCs in a scene that the rest of us aren't involved in, and instead of twiddling our thumbs or talking about what we watched on TV or whatever, we'll chat in-character and make up our own little scenes.  Sometimes we're even actively encouraged to do so: the GM will say something like "This would be a great time for your characters to fill each other in on what you've found out," or more commonly, "This is going to take a while...go ahead and amuse yourselves."  And I guess I just don't see how that's so different from a couple of players doing basically the same thing via e-mail or on a different night than the game.<br/><br/>Mind you, there are certain lines that don't get crossed.  For example, if a conversation is naturally going to involve another PC and that player's not available to participate, the conversation gets postponed.  If the conversation turns towards the PCs actively doing something that will change the course of the game, the GM is cc:ed so that we can play it out in person (or so the GM can say "sure, cool, you do it," if it's no biggie).  If the conversation has an interesting result (two PCs fall in love, make a pact, etc.), everyone gets a summary of the conversation and what the players think was decided by it.

I've experienced out-of-session RP in the latter context, and, while there was some dysfunction, it wasn't nearly as major as what you describe in the LARP.<br/><br/>The thing that really kept our game (D&amp;D, 5 players + GM, described in post 5, above) from really getting out of whack was that there was this sense that all out-of-session additions to the shared imagined fiction were <i>provisional</i> -- the players dubbed them "fanfic" when they started. Most of the time, we would incorporate something from an out-of-game thing back into the game, but there was this shared agreement that events in the "fanfic" weren't canonical automatically, that anyone could disagree with them or countermand them without too many hard feelings. I don't think it always worked, but I think that's what turned it from potential trainwreck into mostly-functional technique.<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58917/#Comment_58917" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-04T03:49:38+00:00" title="March  4, 2007  3:49AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2007 3:51AM by Graham.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alex,<br/><br/>I do see your point.

Did people get pissed off or was it all okay?</blockquote>Mostly the "fanfic" didn't work for other reasons.<br/><br/>This was when it broke down: one of the players wrote his character getting all weird and running away (which, for a high-ish level D&amp;D wizard, means Teleport), which would've either caused him to sit around for the next session doing nothing or turned the entire game into this big story about everyone looking for him (which was frustrating to the other players because they had bigger goals in mind). "Provisional" expectation aside, everyone did feel a bit miffed about that. He quickly said "Okay, I realize this was a bad idea" and retracted the entire thing.<br/><br/>When it did work was when the players were mostly filling in stuff in between scenes we've played out, e.g. what it was like on the eve of a battle we've already fought in-session, or what the characters would've talked about as they were returning home from an adventure (we would usually end sessions by stating where and when the next scene would be, so extending the last scene we played qualifies, too). I think the effect of that was that it made the "fic" something that added to what was going on in game but stripped it of the ability to send it really far off course.<br/><br/><br/>I agree with whoever it was that said this kind of thing often changes up the system: in my example, the D&amp;D we were playing was D&amp;D, and the side stuff was... stuff that wouldn't worked so well in D&amp;D, a lot of the time. I think it was my first big hint that I really, really wanted to play a hardcore Nar or collaborative game, since I had this big moment of "Gee, I really wish we could do a bit more stuff like this in actual play."<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58934/#Comment_58934" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-04T11:32:55+00:00" title="March  4, 2007 11:32AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coordination and cooperation among the group, and everyone being okay with this, really is a key issue. <br/><br/>For an AP example, Mo was in an Exalted game that lasted for something over 4 years. It was a huge game and went through a period in which everyone in the group went from being single to being married and having children, and there were lots of other life changes through the course of the game. Partly because of that it was pretty common that folks would sometimes have to miss the regularly scheduled game -- especially in summers when everyone was traveling. <br/><br/>However, everyone else still wanted to play, but due to the nature of the game's narrative simply playing the present game without them wasn't really doable. So the GM came up with the idea of doing flash-back First Age games when the whole group wasn't present. Those who did show up would get to rock out with MEGA WIDE SCREEN FIRST AGE BADNESS and maybe learn a little about who their character was a lifetime ago. <br/><br/>At first there were no problems with this, and people more and less enjoyed the first age games. Over time some folks came to like them less, as their focus was on the current age and their "real" character. And after that some resentment issues cropped up because the First Age games would occasionally contain secrets about the First Age and players did get XP for taking part in the game. Over the course of years and years this meant that the players who never missed game had significantly more XP and a fistful of secret knowledge that those who missed game more regularly didn't. Those who didn't miss game felt some justification in this -- as they made it to game -- and those who did miss game still felt that it was getting out of hand. In the end the issue got resolved by stopping the First Age games but letting the players keep the secrets and extra XP they'd earned.<br/><br/>The thing about it is that is a situation in which the play is still at the table, with the GM, with the majority (if narrowly) at the table and with everyone having had an equal opportunity (in the abstract, at least) to participate. It wasn't things people were doing outside the game, away from the table, or without the direct and explicit knowledge of everyone else in the group. <br/><br/>OTOH, I've seen games where there were floating GMs played in an ad-hoc manner where the world could radically change between one session you were in and the next, because three of the eight total pool of players had blown up New York while you were in China. People in that game expected that, however, and would roll with it. Over the course of two years that game never had a problem with folks feeling out of the loop of things that happened while they weren't at the table, and I think the reason is that game had a social contract specifically stating that it was going to happen. Everyone went in with their eyes open.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce" title="MtFierce"><img alt="MtFierce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/5582955/1136400"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce">MtFierce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59043/#Comment_59043" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T12:12:38+00:00" title="March  5, 2007 12:12PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had only the canon rule, "If the GM didn't acknowledge, it didn't happen."  I keep that one in my own games; it's a little more than, "If the GM didn't see it," because sometimes I can be talking to someone, and didn't catch all of what happened with someone else.  <br/><br/>This does not limit the play significantly.  Oh sure, every time the GM left the room in our group we'd suggest we just found "bags and bags of treasure" and had "solved the current problem," but that was silly and we relented the point.  There were other outlets; "Dark Side Diaries" which was, "If my character was truly twisted, (s)he would have done this...", and other alternate-perspective journals sent to the group in-between sessions, backstory developments that brought PCs closer together, sent to GM to be accepted as canon, and of course, other various creative outlets.  (Mix CDs with character-oriented songs, filks of the adventures, artist renditions of brochures of places visited, etc.)  <br/><br/>Just because the game was only 4-5 hours once a week didn't mean you had to stop investing in the universe except inside that time frame.<br/><br/>Now, do I feel weird and voyeuristic when I read the scenes done without my input in my world?  No, I feel exuberant, especially the more the players see the same stuff I do...but it took me a while to let go the reins.
