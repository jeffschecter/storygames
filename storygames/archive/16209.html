If you're considering a retail-level reward, please post your project info here and I will make sure it gets on the list. If you're curious how to structure a retail reward, ask Joe, because Monsterhearts did it perfectly!<br/><br/>Beyond that, if you're one of the small group of indie-friendly retailers who lurk or occasionally post here,steel free to chime in too. I'm curious who else is here, and there macreated signers geographically close by who might want to take advantage of a local relationship for sales, play testing, etc.<br/><br/>Finally, if you're an indie/self publisher who'd consider a wholesale deal of some kind to get your games into interested stores, let me know here, too, and I'll pass that info along to the list as well. Based on the packed room I got at GTS, there are plenty of stores interested in new and different RPG stuff to set them apart from the run-of-the-mill Game Pits, so hopefully we can get some of your great games onto game store shelves where even more people can find and play them.<br/><br/>Thanks! if anyone has any questions about the list or wants to talk to me about the presentation I did at GTS, feel free to whisper me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369574/#Comment_369574" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T22:08:32+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 10:08PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>If you're curious how to structure a retail reward, ask Joe, because Monsterhearts did it perfectly!</blockquote>\nMaybe I'll just preemptively answer:<br/><br/>* Create a backer reward level that's for retailers, and labeled as such in its title. For <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/Joe-Mcdaldno-1" rel="nofollow">Monsterhearts</a>, that was called "OVERLORD (Retailer Package)"<br/><br/>* Take your cover price and divide it in half. That's the price that retailers want to buy your game for. For Monsterhearts, $25 divided by 2 was $12.50.<br/><br/>* The easiest way to do the retailer reward tier is to just let anyone choose it. So, obviously, you'll want to have a minimum number of copies for retailers. For Monsterhearts, the retailer minimum I chose was 6 copies (6 x $12.50 = $75). If someone wants to buy six copies for their personal use (and someone in fact did, I think), that's totally fine.<br/><br/>* State that this reward tier is open-ended: for each unit cost (for MH, $12.50) above the minimum that the person contributes, you'll send them another copy. For Monsterhearts, that meant $100 got you 8 copies, and $150 got you 12 copies, and so on.<br/><br/>* Remember to account for shipping costs, in whatever way makes sense for you. For Monsterhearts, the $25/copy price (or $12.50/copy for retailers) included shipping for the IndieGoGo crowd. Now that the IndieGoGo campaign is over, I'm charging shipping on top of that price. (Essentially, free shipping was one of the perks for contributors.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369599/#Comment_369599" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T03:41:34+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  3:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the backer in question, I can confirm that indeed I did purchase the Overlord for personal use.

Half-price would be a huge cut into your margins, is it worth it because: (a) better to make a small amount of money off a purchase than not have that purchase at all, (b) the more copies you print, the lower the price per unit - increasing your margin on other purchases, or (c) there's a non-financial benefit in it, like a greater profile, the satisfaction of seeing your games played, etc. (or, of course, some mix of the above).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369612/#Comment_369612" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T05:52:00+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  5:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a publisher who is not Joe, I would say all of your options are part of the answer. Selling books to retailers puts your game on store shelves, where it will (hopefully) be seen by customers who would otherwise never know about it. Ideally the retailer is also excited about your game and knows how to pitch it to people you will never meet. All of this extends your reach, which is important for a small publisher. Presumably your cover price is engineered to sell at a wholesale discount (usually 50-55%) and still leave you with your costs covered and a healthy profit (say 100-200% of your costs). In our experience, retail sales make up about 2/3 of <i>Fiasco</i>'s total print sales.<br/><br/>In other words, you're making a profit on books you might not otherwise have sold, and generating more awareness and excitement about your game. You also get the indirect benefit of keeping indie-friendly retail stores in business and keeping the hobby healthy, which I feel is pretty important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369661/#Comment_369661" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T09:10:26+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  9:10AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sanglorian,<br/><br/>Steve Segedy summarizes it well. <br/><br/>I still make a profit when I sell to retailers, albeit a smaller one.<br/>In the venn diagram of sales, I'm pretty sure direct-to-customer sales and retail-store sales are somewhat different markets.<br/>Having retailers buy my games means selling more books total.<br/>The same is true of DriveThruRPG. I only make 65% of cover price on sales there, but I'm pretty sure it's an isolated market. Selling there means tapping into a new audience.<br/><br/>As Joseph mentioned, he bought a retailer 6-pack for his personal bookshelf. I made more profit from that exchange than I would have if he'd just bought 1 copy at the regular customer rate.

If you want to make such spiffs available, we won't turn them down, but literally ALL we ask is some reasonable minimum qty at a wholesale price. <br/><br/>One cool thing we have seen one creator do is tie the extras for retailers to the overall reward level: if you make, say, 250% of your goal, you toss in a poster to every retailer package. That encourages us to get on the social media an help push it a bit, but without breaking your bank or feeling like we might actually be paying for something we don't really want or need.<br/><br/>Most small retailers are every bit as 'Indie' as self-publishers, and understand these are tough decisions to make for small companies; all we're looking for is a chance to earn the margin we need to make it worth the effort to stock and sell indie games, and that generally just means getting us the books at keystone (half off retail).<br/><br/>OH!
