The game is called We'll Send It To Them. It was designed as an nonintrusive system for out of session diplomacy. The rules fit on a 4x6 postcard and a PDF template will be given to any backer as well as one of 5 exclusive scenarios sent to you in the mail. Other rewards are there as well.<br/><br/>The goal is to fund a website to host all the amazing stories people will make using this and house a place for people to form game groups together. Thank you for your time and please share this for others to potentially experience. I'll answer every question I can and update the project accordingly to include those questions+answers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390141/#Comment_390141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T18:08:38+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  6:08PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could we have an example postcard? I'm really not sure what this game is. The language you used was pretty vague in the video. I really feel like these videos need to be scripted to be effective. I get that it is a letter-writing type of game, but what exactly is it for and how exactly does it do that, in a different way to some other storytelling game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390159/#Comment_390159" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T20:15:55+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  8:15PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for asking that. Yes, that was mainly the first thing to pop up when other people looked at it and I was focused on the short pitch first. I'm not a fan of hyping a game too much and that intro was meant for people to know the skinny, but you are right that more is required. It's much easier to say I made this game and tell people there's a book than to say what it inside the book. I'll have more detail on the actual game and a mock example up within the next few days.<br/><br/>It has worked fairly well in the tests I've used, but the bulk of the people who have used it love to write.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390263/#Comment_390263" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-14T12:49:42+00:00" title="September 14, 2012 12:49PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A how to play file and example of play have been uploaded to the link for people to read.

To whit:<br/><br/>1. There are fundamental questions remaining unanswered here, especially as regards your main page pitch and video pitch<br/>(eg, how is this game better at producing the type of fiction it produces than would be simply freeform roleplaying via letters/postcards?).<br/><br/>2. Rudy's example character is a horrifyingly one-dimensional, childish, and incredibly racist and overall disgusting caricature of an African. I cannot fathom why you would advertise this as actual play of your game.<br/><br/>3. I still don't get where "system" comes into play. How is this not just freeform roleplaying? Other than making an initial list of methods and then choosing from them, everything is arbitrarily decided by the player, is it not?<br/><br/>4. Where, in any of all this, is the motivation to buy into your game? The video is very clearly off-the-cuff, and should have been scripted to tell us enough about the game and why we should care and minimize the "uh" and "um" that most of us have in conversational speech, but can't stand on video. The language comes out muddled and incoherent, we have no idea what type of art direction you plan to take, what number of players can play, or why they aren't playing something else.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391071/#Comment_391071" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T05:38:02+00:00" title="September 22, 2012  5:38AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the delay, Userclone. I've been too busy to respond and wanted to devote time to give you a sincere answer that wasn't off the cuff.<br/><br/>1. It's better than freeform because freeform doesn't really work how it should when both players really want something in the scene. Desires conflict and a resolution must be done to solve it or it'll circle in perpetuity/until someone gives up. This system accomplishes both tasks while allowing both parties to understand why they wanted the scene to happen, allowing both parties to get their scene in without it needing to be accomplished.<br/><br/>When you freeform via speech, you are using a different portion of your brain to get your intentions across. Your mannerisms and tone are the only things helping you and it may not be clear what your character really believes or is trying to say. When you write it, you have to focus and think about what you want to say, allowing for a deeper relation to what your character wants and allows the other player/s a better understanding since you'll have to use only words to convey your reasons for action. <br/><br/>2. It's not racist if you've ever been to Liberia. There are at least 15 generals that are exactly like the character Rudy portrayed. One General Butt Naked is a fine example of the terrible things that went on there in that part of Africa. Not that it means anything, Rudy is a member of Misery Tourism and that character is right up his alley.<br/><br/>3. The goal is to frame during play, not out of play. This is different than most frame structure mechanics due to it being enacted while playing instead of describing what is happening, then doing a brief 'roleplay' to call it good.<br/><br/>4. There is no reason to get it the same way a lot of games don't have a good reason to get it. It's going to either be free or for a dollar when this whole thing is over and I just want a space to house everyone's work as well as have a place to meet and play with other people. I could hijack a section of a forums and do that or start a free forums, but it won't have the on-site options I would like it to have. That is the reason for the IndieGoGo project.<br/><br/>I only expect writers and a small group of people to enjoy this and at best, I'll get $10 if it reaches the $500 I'm asking. You do bring up a good point about art direction. That should be answered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
