I think I have a decent design so far, I have playtested the crap out of it so far, and I have done my research. It's a game that focuses on action movie feel, pushing your luck, fluid gameplay and having some crunch without having massive rules cruft or making you read tons of stuff. Not really a sales pitch. More my goals in practicing my design skills .<br/><br/><br/>My biggest problem so far is writing a good pitch, and figuring out how to get feedback/interest from people outside of my local circle. Anyone care to share their tips on how to write a good pitch/tagline, where to go for feedback and how to present things?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452763/#Comment_452763" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-28T21:02:06+00:00" title="April 28, 2016  9:02PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your game has an interesting setting start by selling it. If the interesting part is what it does, describe it using more emotions, as in the emotions it will produce in the players. Any reference you can use to give us an idea of how game plays like is welcome. It's also important to mention what the players will be doing in the game. Your pitch isn't too bad actually, you just need to add a couple of things. <br/><br/>For example, using your description above and rearranging it to sound more convincing, it could be: "X game is a tabletop rpg with fluid gameplay focused on giving an action movie feel, <i>Kill Bill</i> style, without massive rules and yet with the right amount of complexity. Players would be pushing their luck to be able to achieve N goals, which will put everyone at each other throats at the climax of the game. Friendship, Honor or Ambition, which will prevail?"<br/><br/>That's my two cents, after that , I would also like to know where to go and how to get attention; I've got and idea of where and how in my country, but not on the internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452772/#Comment_452772" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T07:35:04+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  7:35AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2016 7:39AM by Rickard.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for writing a pitch, I think this video is using a good model.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en</a><br/><br/>As for get your game out there, it takes time and effort. Go to different forums, groups on G+, and even Reddit, and ask for feedback.

Basically embrace mutualism, make friends, ideally meet people face to face and play with them, and the people you connect with become your pool of playtesters over time. That playtesting for others sharpens your own design skills is an added bonus.<br/><br/>Don't "sell it" or "pitch it", build a community of people who know and trust you.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce" title="soyosauce"><img alt="soyosauce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce">soyosauce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452857/#Comment_452857" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-02T15:47:53+00:00" title="May  2, 2016  3:47PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mmm yeah, I'm sure you can find people interested in playing without paying them.
