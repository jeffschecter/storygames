They may not have used this terminology, but modern usage of the terminology matches perfectly, note-for-note with what other players describe. You can see it in the alt.games.whitewolf discussions of World of Darkness in the 1990s, you can see it in letters columns in the 1980s, you can see it in forum posts in the 2000s. D&amp;D is "Trad" and everything else is "indie".<br/><br/>As a result, people who know about both types and like D&amp;D will choose "trad" over "indie".<br/><br/>D&amp;D has a unique combination of traits that really can't be found in any other game.  Since it has always been the supermajority of play in the hobby (in America) other games and definitely gamers primarily have positioned themselves in opposition to one aspect or another of D&amp;D (White Wolf games derided them for dramatic dullness, Champions/HERO had it's point-buy system advertising class-less play, and so on.)  The exception, perhaps, is the fantasy heartbreaker, which often felt like "D&amp;D, ONLY BETTER!!"  You might be able to convince me that such games should be classed with D&amp;D in the "trad" category.<br/><br/>Overwhelmingly, people choose "trad" gaming because they like D&amp;D.  That's all there is to it!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452415/#Comment_452415" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T21:13:28+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  9:13PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 9:18PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do I fit into your scheme?<br/><br/>I quite like AD&amp;D 1e, AD&amp;D 2e and especially BECMI D&amp;D. Where AD&amp;D 1e fits into this hierarchy depends on whether it is run strictly RAW (which is almost impossible) or with some slackening of the rules (which I more or less take for granted).<br/><br/>I loathe D&amp;D 3e and Pathfinder.<br/><br/>I suspect that I would quite enjoy D&amp;D 5e about as much as AD&amp;D 2e and slightly less than BECMI D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I suspect that I would find D&amp;D 4e quite interesting intellectually but a bit dry.<br/><br/>I suspect that I would quite like OD&amp;D.<br/><br/>I vastly prefer some of my own games, especially Soul's Calling, which heavily prioritises character immersion, incorporates in a rough and ready way elements of Stanislavsky's acting theory (sort of), allows for (and thrives on the involvement of) deputy GMs and emphasises the use of direct speech for character interaction. It could be tarred, not entirely unfairly, with the deeply offensive brush of "fantasy heartbreaker".<br/><br/>By and large, I would rather play any of Duty and Honour, Fiasco, PbtA or OctaNe than D&amp;D 3e or Pathfinder.<br/><br/>I would be just about as happy playing WHFRP 2e or Runequest as I would be playing BECMI D&amp;D, and possibly happier playing WHFRP 2e or Runequest than I would be playing AD&amp;D 2e.<br/><br/>I would probably rather play early Call of Cthulhu than any edition of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I would rather play any edition of D&amp;D (even 3rd edition) than Burning Wheel, except for a one-shot as a matter of curiosity just to be able to say that I had tried it.<br/><br/>The choice between Montsegur 1244 and D&amp;D 3rd edition would be a difficult one for me, not because Montsegur 1244 isn't great, but because it is psychologically painful for me to be engaged in character-switching when I have a main character already, and because of the frustration of the confines of the "story" and the certainty of the pre-envisioned outcome.<br/><br/>I would play my own game Soul's Calling in preference to any other tabletop game. The appeal it holds to me is in the fulfilment of the goals I have for trad games (even if it also allows deputy GMs, which could be regarded as an "indie"-influenced idea).<br/><br/>I would be delighted to play Chris Loizou's freeform Cursed Empire (trad) or a Star Wars hack of Duty and Honour ("indie") or a game like the Four Orcs and One Dwarf Crimson Empire scenario I once played (trad), all with equal enthusiasm.<br/><br/>I would play a Star Wars hack of Duty and Honour in preference to any edition of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I would rather play my favourite foam-sword LARP than any tabletop game (even one of my own design). I view such LARPs as trad.<br/><br/>I would play a decent and interesting salon LARP (with GMs) just as happily and enthusiastically as I would play any tabletop game (even one of my own design). I view such LARPs as trad.<br/><br/>I self-identify as a trad gamer but there are many "indie" gaming experiences that I have had that have been better than the majority of my "trad" gaming experiences... it's just that my best "trad" experiences have been the best of all, and represent what I aspire to. And in that category I include foam-sword and salon LARPs and the Four Orcs and One Dwarf scenario mentioned above (even though one of the players made it obvious that she hated it) as well as a one-shot game of full-fat Omnifray my mate ran and Chris Loizou's freeform Cursed Empire. (Though I don't like the full-crunch version of Cursed Empire.)<br/><br/>Fit that into your framework!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452420/#Comment_452420" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T22:06:31+00:00" title="April 20, 2016 10:06PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good answer, Jason - thanks. I'll give you my experience on the matter:<br/><br/>Around here I generally meet and get to know four types of roleplayers, roughly speaking. These are vague categories of play history and preference, basically "gamer character classes":<br/><br/><b>D&amp;D gamers</b> play pretty exclusively D&amp;D. They get uncomfortable and don't have fun with a game that is not a party-based fantasy adventure game with a challenge-oriented framework (whether challenge is the creative core of the game is negotiable). There is a huge number of games available to this type of gamer ranging from FFG Warhammer 40k games to actual D&amp;D to strange OSR things. Some of these switch groups a lot and play with a lot of different people (e.g. the Pathfinder living campaign, or OSR mega-circles), while others are a bit more staid socially.<br/><br/><b>"Normal" Finnish tabletop roleplayers</b> who are 30-something in age nowadays, started to play in the early '90s and never stopped. They play trad games (e.g. Runequest, Cyberpunk 2020, Call of Cthulhu, MERP, Exalted would all be considered normal fare here), the groups are generally stable and pretty isolated socially, and a specific player is usually the GM. Play ranges from almost-D&amp;D to near-freeform, with a premium put to things like setting consistency and roleplaying character. These generally don't play a lot of D&amp;D - 3rd edition got some interest, but generally speaking it's considered too "gamey" and not varied enough.<br/><br/><b>Artsy experimentalists</b> are, well, folks like myself - ambitious about the gaming, try out lots of different things, spend a lot of time playing esoteric games or playtesting something or other, or whatever. Usually widely experienced with different types of games, and commonly attached to a more specific type of gaming group - for example, I spent the last three years playing with D&amp;D gamers for the most part, myself.<br/><br/><b>Freeformers and larpers</b> are people who dislike dice and rules and character sheets and such, which all of the above groups generally like.<br/><br/>Now, the point in this breakdown is to illustrate why I don't think that your division between D&amp;D and everything else really matches the local experience around here. It is quite possible that the situation is different in your part of the world, but at least here the big, fat divisive line between "traditional" and "everything else" customarily been drawn in between the second and third group above; this means that many gamers who have <i>never</i> played D&amp;D consider themselves staunchly traditionalist!<br/><br/>I've always gotten the sense in various Internet discussions that while D&amp;D is perhaps more popular in the US than it is here, there still exists a big, vocal slice of gaming population who resemble the "normal" Finnish gamer: a lot of different games in the menu, not particularly attached to dungeon fantasy as a genre, but ultimately very conservative about the game having a skill system, GM-designed adventures and so on and so forth. While it is true that D&amp;D is the core of this tradition, it is not uncommon at all for gamers like this to <i>dislike</i> D&amp;D, considering it a primitive and simplistic game that does not foster real roleplaying, or is not realistic enough, or whatever else.<br/><br/>To put it succinctly: players of GURPS, Harnmaster or Exalted are widely perceived around here to be "normal" roleplayers and not "indie" at all. From your explanation I would expect that this type of traditional gamer would either like D&amp;D (because it is the root of the tradition, as you rightly point out) or not <i>be</i> traditional.<br/><br/>This particular experience of mine is a reason for why I don't think that affinity with D&amp;D is <i>quite</i> the defining benchmark of the tradition. It's a really big part of it, like I agree with your point here 70%, metaphorically speaking, but the tradition has apparently had space to grow beyond D&amp;D, as evidenced by many gamers happily rejecting D&amp;D while sticking to the tradition like glue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452421/#Comment_452421" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T22:38:47+00:00" title="April 20, 2016 10:38PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 10:39PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My scheme doesn't try to classify gamers, it only answers Eero's question: "why would people internalize the terms 'trad' and 'indie' and then, at some point in their lives, select the former over the latter". Like I barely classify <i>one segment of one decision in the life of a certain population</i>, not people generally, so omnifray, little you mentioned has any bearing on this question.  You like D&amp;D, for some values of D&amp;D, so at some times and places in your life, you pick "trad" gaming over "indie" gaming.  It doesn't mean you always do so or that all values of D&amp;D are equally appealing to you.  To the average (American) roleplayer, Montsegur, Call of Cthulhu, Fiasco and Cartoon Action Hour are the same: obscure, non-D&amp;D games.  The proof of this is in what American roleplayers purchase and play and in what quantities and durations.  Further, the only rigorous survey of (American) roleplayers ever produced confirmed this understanding - when (American) roleplayers stop liking D&amp;D they don't, generally speaking, move to another game, they leave the hobby.<br/><br/>Now, I hang out with people who like to play a lot of games. But I don't believe for a second they are in any way indicative of how roleplayers generally are.  If I ever doubt myself, I can send an e-mail to John Wick and ask how many copies of Blood &amp; Honor he sold last year. Then I no longer doubt myself. "Right again," I sigh, putting my sunglasses back on.  <br/><br/>I don't know anything about Finland though, maybe they have a different thing they perceive as 'traditional' roleplaying. But here, overwhelmingly, it's D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452429/#Comment_452429" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T23:35:29+00:00" title="April 20, 2016 11:35PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason makes a good point.<br/><br/>However, my experience has been similar to Eero's: most of the "traditional" roleplayers I know are quite attached to that style of play but do not like D&amp;D. Typically they like to play GURPS or something of the sort, which allows them to play "D&amp;D-like" games, but with what they perceive as better realism or more flexibility. There are also the types who Vampire or other relatively mainstream games from the 90's.<br/><br/>This type of gamer has often had bad experiences with D&amp;D and loves to talk about how "stupid" alignment rules are, and so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452432/#Comment_452432" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T23:39:48+00:00" title="April 20, 2016 11:39PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 11:40PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience for at least the 20 or so years from 1991 to 2011 was that White Wolf players saw themselves as independent strivers for roleplaying excellence in opposition to the bad old traditional D&amp;D.

D&amp;D is not entirely homogeneous, even if you look at say the difference in the rules as written between BECMI and D&amp;D 3e and then again D&amp;D 4e, let alone if you look at the actual experiences of play across very different groups and games. Many games of D&amp;D have more in common with particular games of non-D&amp;D than they have in common with each other.<br/><br/>If you expand the concept of D&amp;D to include "d20" and "OGL" then this becomes even more true.<br/><br/>So for example a political drama game of AD&amp;D 1e may have more in common (in terms of how it feels in play) with a typical V:tR MET-LARP than it really has in common with a dungeoncrawl game of D&amp;D 3e. <br/><br/>So I doubt that dividing the RPG world into "D&amp;D" and "non-D&amp;D" serves any useful purpose beyond identifying the role of brand recognition and network externalities in dictating what people play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452435/#Comment_452435" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T23:50:25+00:00" title="April 20, 2016 11:50PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 11:52PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My experience for at least the 20 or so years from 1991 to 2011 was that White Wolf players saw themselves as independent strivers for roleplaying excellence in opposition to the bad old traditional D&amp;D.

It seems to me it's a question of what is percieved as known, or normal, and depends greatly on what you started out playing. Me, I began with CoC in the late 80's. I proceeded to Shadowrun, GURPS, MERP, things like that.<br/>However, if I'd begun playing Monsterhearts or GUMSHOE or Annalise, <i>those</i> would be what I'd internalize as "trad" games, because I grew up on them. The age and type of game is rather irellevant. What the player started out playing is what defines the subjective normality.<br/>And let's face it, the main reason we call it indie is because of low sales. If Apocalypse World sold as well as VtM, we wouldn't call it Indie for long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452941/#Comment_452941" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T15:51:43+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  3:51PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if you don't make the distinction, then, again, I'm not talking about you in my answer.

Languages like French, German, Italian would get D&amp;D translated early and often, while minor language areas would often get games from other American companies that were more approachable and interested in making a deal with a local publisher. Generally speaking minor language area operators would only get a TSR license with patience, business acumen and willingness to lean backwards for TSR.<br/><br/>For example, I seem to remember that the Tudeer brothers (who pretty much single-handedly brought the roleplaying hobby to Finland in the mid-'80s) <i>tried</i> to get a license for D&amp;D when they were choosing the first games to translate into Finnish; TSR wasn't interested (I don't remember the exact reason off-hand, but I'd bet that the necessarily modest scale of the project would play a part in something like that), so they went with Chaosium (and later other similar medium-sizers), and the rest is history - Runequest (Finnish edition in '88) and Call of Cthulhu are easily the most well-known rpgs in Finland, thanks to the Finnish editions being published by the most prominent rpg retailers in the country. Just a little while later Jari Pauna - another early hobbyist - was successful in negotiating a license to D&amp;D from TSR and published the Mentzer red box to considerable commercial success, but the Tudeers had the market advantage in the form of their prominent retail business, plus an edge in product quality; D&amp;D never became hegemonic in Finland the way it had in the USA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453539/#Comment_453539" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-24T22:09:28+00:00" title="May 24, 2016 10:09PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of indie vs trad.
