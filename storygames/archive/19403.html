I made some stat heavy RPGs and noticed how the numbers got in the way of simulating the world. They became static rather than real information. A dialogue between players seemed like a better approach. After going down that path a short way I noticed that it changed the way I thought. I was looking more at what could possibly happen and which option I wanted to pick rather than worrying about the most probably (i.e. most likely to pass a task resolution roll).<br/><br/>Opening up people's way of thinking to possibilities rather than probabilities is one of the biggest gifts that Indie games can give. I would like to see if other people see this and/or think that it is also a big deal.<br/><br/>I'll throw out an opener: Dungeon World<br/><br/>By saying up front that it is a conversation between the GM and players, and making dice rolls very simple when they happen, and that they might not even be needed, the game pulls our thoughts away from numbers and onto actions and consequences. The neat thing is that DW just codifies what I always did in running D+D anyway. We ignored most of the numbers and focused on having fun. <br/><br/>So please tell your game observations but more explore how/if this leads to better story games.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431988/#Comment_431988" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T13:51:15+00:00" title="May  2, 2014  1:51PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm quite interested in probabilities versus possibilities and it's a subject I often think about when constructing a game, in the form of questions like <i>why make that random?</i> or <i>what happens if the probabilities produce outcomes of this specific type?</i><br/><br/>Part of this stems from the growth of RPGs from their strategic gaming roots, with their min-maxing and careful advance planning before any action. I much prefer jumping in feet first and will often work against my character's agenda, because it creates a more interesting and dramatic story if they fail: this isn't well supported by systems that assume you always want your character to succeed.<br/><br/>One very eye-opening game is Ron Edward's Elfs: it's a traditional fantasy game, with some tongue-in-cheek comedy elements that are supported and encouraged by the game's mechanics. You can play it straight and say what your character tries to achieve, but you can also add a meta-layer to your narration by saying "That's what my <i>character</i> wants to happen, but what's <i>going</i> to happen is..." Doing so gives you an extra die to roll, thus raising your chances of success, but it makes that success a result of circumstances beyond the character's control, instead of their own expressed intents and actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431990/#Comment_431990" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T14:22:55+00:00" title="May  2, 2014  2:22PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the concept of consequences with (yes but.) e.g you can shoot the guy but he drops the glass vial. <br/>In Technoir Adjectives , verbs items build a dice pool in a more descriptive manner than in trad  games.<br/><br/>But all these story elements blur the edge between simulation and narration rights.<br/>This is only my thoughts and could be wrong, im no game designer or great master in game fu.<br/><br/>This is the crux of my blindness.

A lot of us who used to play D&amp;D in school/college now have a job, family and other responsibilities.<br/>2. Computer-based and online RPGs have drawn a lot of people who are into stats and simulationist/tactical play. <br/>It has left the Pen&amp;Paper community with people who enjoy telling a story together.<br/><br/>For game rules shifting from simulationist mechanics to story mechanics, here is an example:<br/>- in traditional RPG, the <i>character</i>  would spend his gold coins on a bazar based on a price list from the rule book.<br/>- in i.e. Fate, the <i>player</i> makes a "Resource" roll. Based on the result, the players roleplay their characters accordingly.<br/><br/>In story-based mechanics, you don't need rules to simulate the whole game world. You're allowed to <i>make up what you want</i> within a certain game framework. This gives games the freedom to have a lighter, more abstract rule-set that can be unified, combined, stacked etc.<br/>Example: <br/>Cortex Plus Dramatic Roleplaying (Smallville) gives you attributes for i.e. "Values", "Relationship" and "Assets". You could save your colleague John using:<br/>- Value "Justice": D8<br/>- Relationship "Colleague John": D6<br/>- Asset "Super-Speed": D10<br/>So you bring these three attributes together in one action, throwing three dice D8+D6+D10 together. <br/>No way you could do something like that with a traditional more simulationist RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431998/#Comment_431998" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T17:23:03+00:00" title="May  2, 2014  5:23PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, of course, I have to point out, that according to the definitions, there's plenty of Smallville play that's simulationist, just not simulating reality, instead simulating the workings of a supernatural TV drama.<br/><br/>But all those definitions are garbage anyhow, as is everything associated with GNS, so why quibble.<br/><br/>Anyway, I got a math degree in college (ahem) years ago, and frankly the games, whether "heavy" or "lite" which completely fuck up their probabilities or statistics is mind-boggling.

This is a huge challenge, and very hard to balance!<br/><br/>Dealing with possibilities: let's come up with some things which could happen next, and then pick one (whether randomly or not), detours a number of challenges.

Even heavily mechanical/dicey games don't necessarily restrict story possibilities, though they may take greater expertise and/or finesse to prepare for. I came here to these forums because for almost thirty years my gaming groups have been focused on the stories rather than the numbers. However, we tell those stories primarily in very numbers-heavy games (D&amp;D, Shadowrun, etc).<br/><br/>For us the numbers part is about simulation of reality in that it (supposedly) reduces personal bias in the resolution of conflict. Some games do this well, others not so well. Generally speaking our groups prefer not to know how things are going to come out. Most of us like to 'play in the DMs world', allowing stories to be revealed to us in the same way a reader experiences the author's stories, or moviegoer's experience the screenwriter/director's stories. While we enjoy the limited control of choosing our responses within that world (or maybe even developing unique subplots on our own), rather it works or not isn't up to us sometimes; it's actually that facet that attracts us to those games. In that way they're more like a choose your own adventure than a fully open narrative, though rather than being fully pre-determined the dice (or whatever) use probability to pick.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at here is that there's no inherent tie between the level or type of mechanics/diceyness, and possibilities of or for storytelling. They're merely different forms of games...not better or worse, but different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432011/#Comment_432011" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T20:21:08+00:00" title="May  2, 2014  8:21PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2014 8:22PM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed and raise you one.

Can you share more of how it works on the flip side?</blockquote>\nSure. It's as simple as the difference between deciding "is this possible, or interesting?" and "how probable, exactly, is this thing over that thing?"<br/><br/>You make a great point about the failure of wide-open possibility: it can paralyze people. But "possibility" doesn't have to be wide-open. For example, I might say, "Character X fails miserably in this situation. Player C, tell us how that comes about!" Or, "but his actions have an unintended consequence. What might that be?"<br/><br/>The coupling of constraint to possibility gives an easy instrument to play with. <br/><br/>In comparison, trying to figure out how *probable* it is that Character X fails, and how that might come about, and whether it might have unintended consequences, can very difficult. Is it a 50% chance of failure, and a 20% chance of failure because of his lack of skill, but a 30% chance of failure because of his lack of courage, and a 40% chance of failure because his opponent is stronger than him? And a 37% chance of unintended consequences? Not obvious questions. Should that be a -4 because he's clearly not having a good day today, or?<br/><br/>In the first case, all you need is one (or more) ideas that *could* fit the situation or produce interesting play. In the second, you need to consider ALL the possible outcomes and then rank them in order of probability (which is sometimes a nearly impossible task - well, how often DOES it rain in the supernatural desert caused by a demonic curse?). In comparison, if we have a game mechanic which tells us that "on a failed roll, the weather turns sour", that leaves the player with only the need to provide some colour or flavour to that outcome. She doesn't need to know how *likely* it is to rain, she just needs to decide whether it's *possible*, and then she can go ahead and describe it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432017/#Comment_432017" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T20:56:27+00:00" title="May  2, 2014  8:56PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't think the two are mutually exclusive ideas at all.

I like a crunchy game from time to time. Variety and the spice of Life and all. Events in a game (story) can be made in lots of different ways. The way system matters here though is a play on the slogan "You are what you eat." In this case "You are what you think" or more accurately the way you think. <br/><br/>Trad role play was so much more open to inventiveness than old war games. Games that use mechanics that focus on writing and word conversation rather than number algorithms create different insights. I found myself jumping from critical event to critical event and thinking more about relationships and emotions than Trad games inspired me to do.

Should he hit or miss with it, the results will be fairly small.<br/>Hero <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is armed with a military flamethrower. Should he hit or miss with it, the results will be fairly large. <br/><br/>In game terms Hero <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> will roll a d4, while Hero <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> will roll a d10.<br/><br/>Now picture a simple table, numbered 1-10 (actually the FIAT is 1-20, but I'm simplifying for this example). On that table all even numbers are success, and all odd numbers are failure. The impact of success or failure increases with the number. Hence a 3 or 4 does very little, while a 9 or 10 does quite a lot. Either hero may hit or miss, and both may end up doing very little (by rolling low), but only the flamethrower stands a chance at having great impact directly (by rolling high).<br/><br/>I used a combat example, but it holds for any test. <br/><br/>We wanted a system that accounted for the dangers, as well as the boons, of wielding great power. We did that through Magnitude (ie higher sides on the die = higher table results = bigger impact), and a reduced base chance of success (50% at the absolute stripped down minimum). <br/><br/>We also wanted it to happen without multiple rolls, derived numbers, heavy math, excessive modifiers, etc...but to retain adjustable probability. We did that by using the set table with a variable number of dice of variable sides, instead of one die with variable modifiers against a variable target. <br/><br/>Finally we wanted the focus on narrative. We accomplished this through consideration of unintended consequences (tied in to the powers and skills themselves during creation, and again at use) and something I haven't even mentioned yet (Encounter Balance) that gets a bit too complicated for this, but the overall point is that the narrative objectively impacts the outcome in the same way the dice randomly impact the outcome.<br/><br/>Here's the example we use to intro the game:<br/><br/><i>Imagine the following scene from a comic book:<br/><br/>A superhero who transforms into metal is walking with another that can emit flames. The two are near the beach when a villain strikes at the resort ahead, destroying a pillar which supports the overhang. The first hero shifts form and leaps to stop the collapse of the arched entrance. The second hero envelopes herself in flames and runs to the dunes to distract the villain and protect the fleeing citizens. <br/><br/>Seems straightforward enough. Now let\u2019s look at the same scene as it would be intended to play out in a Stupid Heroes game session.<br/><br/>Steelboy declares he is shifting form. Unfortunately for him they were walking on an old wooden boardwalk at a beach where the salt and humidity rot wood faster than reality television rots your brain. Now weighing several hundred pounds more than he did the hero crashes through the planks and sinks calf-deep in the soft sand underneath.<br/><br/>Cinder-ella flames on with a lot of adrenaline and good intentions. This ignites the wood she was standing on, creating a potential funeral pyre around her companion. If she\u2019s burning hot enough she may be turning the sand into glass fields, fragile and very sharp. Speaking of temperatures, how is it that she can surround herself in flames without being burned, or at least using up the oxygen she needs to breathe?<br/><br/>However the battle between \u2018good and evil\u2019 pans out there could be Hell to pay once it was over. Will the city want payment for the ruined boardwalk? Will the bad guy be acquitted since the heroes weren\u2019t sworn law enforcement officers? Does a father become an anti-superhero vigilante when his daughter is injured on the flame-created glass dunes?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432020/#Comment_432020" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-02T23:39:02+00:00" title="May  2, 2014 11:39PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I don't think the two are mutually exclusive ideas at all.

I've tried to analyze it, and this is what I've come to so far:<br/><br/>1. I really, really, REALLY understood the systems. The better you know and understand something, the more invisible it can become. Expertise dispels clunkyness. This was directly enhanced by me spending 10-20 hours minimum prepping a single eight-hour game session. Even today that hasn't much changed. I wrote a 70+ page novelette to introduce a new group to our Shadowrun campaign.<br/><br/>2. I was blessed with an extremely talented, and homogeneous group. They were all very bright, very well versed in the subject matter, and all enjoyed the same style of play for the most part. We were all close friends/family regardless of the games. Still play with these people, and new people of the same caliber that we attract.<br/><br/>3. We knew from the beginning that all the mechanics were merely about instilling unbiased reality (supposedly) into an otherwise narrative form. Combined with Rule Zero (present in nearly every early game in some form) this leaves you with games where you can try to do anything you can imagine, and it may or may not work depending on rolls and whims. <br/><br/>Matthew Finches 'Quick Primer for Old School Gaming' does a GREAT job of highlighting how these early game sessions differed from their mechanically weighted-down evolutionary variants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432031/#Comment_432031" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-03T03:01:32+00:00" title="May  3, 2014  3:01AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Dealing with possibilities: let's come up with some things which could happen next, and then pick one (whether randomly or not), detours a number of challenges.

It could look like with possibilities that you have to think of them up front. This would be very cumbersome (like that D+D rule my brothers and I never used). Fiasco tables are an example of this. But it can also mean having a method for resolving whatever is made up so it can be rules lite.

I really, really, REALLY understood the systems. The better you know and understand something, the more invisible it can become. Expertise dispels clunkyness. This was directly enhanced by me spending 10-20 hours minimum prepping a single eight-hour game session. Even today that hasn't much changed. I wrote a 70+ page novelette to introduce a new group to our Shadowrun campaign.<br/><br/>2. I was blessed with an extremely talented, and homogeneous group. They were all very bright, very well versed in the subject matter, and all enjoyed the same style of play for the most part. We were all close friends/family regardless of the games. Still play with these people, and new people of the same caliber that we attract.<br/><br/>3. We knew from the beginning that all the mechanics were merely about instilling unbiased reality (supposedly) into an otherwise narrative form. Combined with Rule Zero (present in nearly every early game in some form) this leaves you with games where you can try to do anything you can imagine, and it may or may not work depending on rolls and whims. <br/></blockquote>\n<br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Expertise can overcome rules clunkiness for sure.

What I see here is "We've always done like this and it works" - and I agree it works - but IMHO it only works because you're 1) used to it and 2) made workarounds. If you want to tell stories, then use the right tools. Don't use Shadowrun or DnD because then you can tell stories despite the rule mechanics.<br/><br/>My ideas doesn't remove uncertainty. You still have a game master that will answer back. It doesn't remove objectivity. In my head, the game master, together with the players, want to create a continuous and logical story. They want to collaboratively tell something with the help of characters and events. Note that I used "participants" in my previous post instead of having the old game master/players agenda. Note that improv works very much in this manner. No plans, but something that grows from a starting point but it will grow differently depending on who are attending.<br/><br/>And much like AW does today, the characters could affect the story in a certain way by just showing up. To play a hardholder will create a different story compared to another playbook, but the same should go with the game master. That person should affect the story in a certain way by just being at the table, but in a controlled manner by the game. For my personally, I don't think it's necessary to have the game master roll dice when using a move. The uncertainty will come from which move the game master will choose, and what consequence that will bring. A consequence another person will react to.

When you can't predict the outcome because of the number of possibilities. Emergence is created through making it possible that several parts in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System" rel="nofollow">system</a> can interact with each other. A conversation can create emergence, where different persons in a room are parts of a system. Abilities that can be combined can create emergence. Instead of having four abilities, if they all can be combined with each other you get (4\xd73\xd72\xd71=) 24 different ways of using them. If you only can combine two of them, you still have (4*(4-1)/2=) six different ways of using them. Numbers, by themselves, can't create this kind of synergy where Y+X only results in a different number. Sure, probabilities can make the end result uncertain by saying it's a 60 % chance to succeed, but possibilities is about obscuring what <i>choices</i> the others will do and therefor make the end result unpredictable.<br/><br/>When I'm talking about flattening out a rule system, I'm talking about the latter.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Also, a related topic is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVL4st0blGU" rel="nofollow">depth vs complexity</a> if we're instead talking about tactical systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432036/#Comment_432036" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-03T05:22:16+00:00" title="May  3, 2014  5:22AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2014 5:52AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Numbers by themselves cannot break out of a basically orthogonal matrix, no matter how large you make it, because each cell in that matrix is still 1:1 representational with an object property in the gameworld.  It is either within the realm of possibility or it isn't.  The difference between emergence via recombinant cells in a matrix and emergence via human agency is that the latter can create statements that not only recombine elements within the matrix but fall completely outside it or alter its ontology, forcing a second-order interpretation to be applied.  Given this, when dealing with humans :-) you can create whole systems largely out of second-order statements, e.g., "When you break a rule in this <i>kind</i> of way, this <i>kind</i> of thing happens."  ...and then a human interprets that, depending on the circumstances.<br/><br/>The AW approach generates a lot of its mojo by stepping up to this second order right away.<br/><br/>But even AW includes the Principle of "Sometimes, disclaim decision-making".

That dice rolls (or similar) has to be part of the game, otherwise it wont be fun. I myself love random tables but when I think back of how good (or not) the tilt works in <b>Fiasco</b>, how good dice rolls works in roleplaying games, how the cards creates certain awkward situations in <b>Once Upon a Time</b>, I come to wonder if we mostly assume Rule 0 or make interpretation as a patch to make all this work. Random tables and similar are great as a starting point, but when they show up during play, it can be very hard to interpret them.<br/><br/>This is something that I feel come up in AW too. Why should the dice, that takes nothing of what happen previously into account, tell me how many effects to choose when using a move? I'd rather have a buy point system, if any, in that case. We can rely on stochastic elements to be interpreted by the users, but I kind of think it's lazy design. "We need uncertainty, so why not throw in dice/cards?"<br/><br/>(There are 2-3 different topics in these two paragraphs but I will stop there and see where it's going instead of writing an essay about it. I rather having ideas be formed and clarified in an organic way through discussion rather than presenting full ideas.

We try every game we come across, including modern and indies; Burning Wheel, Mouseguard (one of our favs btw), Fiasco, you name it. We have a much smaller exposure than many on here, due mostly to our small, backwater location and limited time. But we have seen and understand other systems and options. It isn't that we do it because we always have, we do it because the systems work perfectly to play the games we want to play at that time (narratives with strong simulation elements, or simulations with strong narrative focus, whichever way you want to look at it). It also isn't because we've made workarounds. Most games we play fairly close to interpreted text, at least for a couple decades. When we do hack a ruleset it's almost always a minor refinement, or edition merger. Our D&amp;D is Basic/1st/2nd with refinement, our Shadowrun is 1st/2nd/3rd with almost no refinement. However these came about only after 29/24 years of playing straight text.<br/><br/>Lemme offer an example. My favorite 'campaign' is a TOEE/Slavers/GDQ/Return to TOEE story arc. We've played it several times, and I even hacked versions of it together for use with other game systems (BW, WHFRP, RM, etc). The overall setting and background is the same in every iteration, but the story that ends up being told against that backdrop is vastly different every time due to the characters, subplots, and game system used. We've had epic high fantasy, straight D&amp;D trope, political centered mystery/intrigue, even tortured personal conflict and philosophy centered versions. There's simply no reason that such stories should be in any way limited just because in combat you have hit points, or calculate thac0, or roll percentage on a crit chart, or any other mechanical feature. We'll play for 1-2 hours without touching a rule because all that's going on is setting, dialogue, and exposition, so how do mechanical rules have any bearing on that anyway?<br/><br/>When we are rolling dice it's merely to inject rational probability, to sustain the simulation. In our opinion that's a focal point of the joy...THAT's where the improv comes in; reacting to the fickleness of fate and working together to make the story happen despite the random curveballs (in essence what every person does in life/reality). I disagree that you can have objective human decisions. We are, by definition, biased. Reality, on the other hand, often operates under true chance (closely represented by cards, dice, etc). The 'not knowing' and random aspects of chance mirror realism, of which logic is a part. Now, there's nothing at all wrong with illogical. Saturday morning cartoons were hilarious, but wholly illogical. It's merely two different forms of entertainment, neither of which is inherently 'better' at telling a story.<br/><br/>I return to the movie analogy I have used several times on these forums. To tell a story in movie form you have a writer/director/producer. While the actors have input, and control characterization, they do so in order to tell a somewhat predetermined story. The subplots and finer points are fluid, but against a fixed background. That's the only possible way to make a good movie in my opinion. Now, it's not that movies are a superior form of entertainment. They're not. But they are a perfectly valid form of entertainment. Improv is a perfectly valid form of entertainment as well. But I don't go see improv when I want to see a movie, and vice versa. However either can tell essentially the same story, in a different way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432046/#Comment_432046" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-03T12:20:08+00:00" title="May  3, 2014 12:20PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Something that I thought of when I read the original post was that it was a topic about <i>emergence</i>.

It is either within the realm of possibility or it isn't.  The difference between emergence via recombinant cells in a matrix and emergence via human agency is that the latter can create statements that not only recombine elements within the matrix but fall completely outside it or alter its ontology, forcing a second-order interpretation to be applied.  Given this, when dealing with humans :-) you can create whole systems largely out of second-order statements, e.g., "When you break a rule in this <i>kind</i> of way, this <i>kind</i> of thing happens."  ...and then a human interprets that, depending on the circumstances.<br/></blockquote>\nOne thought experiment I had early on in exploring this was to think about describing the world using a matrix of words (the origin of matrix games). A matrix might look like the following:<br/><br/>Maximum Force.          Surrender<br/><br/>Wealth                          Consumption<br/><br/>It's not numerical so it really doesn't use those rules but could work on other kind of logic.

I've also tried out different perspectives in roleplaying game design by creating smaller games. I will perhaps give Midsummer Wood a ride, even if I don't really like systems where you're judged by others. That kind of mechanic does takes a group trust of it's own, and it may also hinder some shyer people in contributing.<br/><br/>What I had in mind when I talk about social contingency (other people being randomizers) is that people build on each other's ideas. I think however the designer must break free from the whole conflict approach in roleplaying games to be able to do that. On the other hand, now when I come to think of it, that's not really true. My own <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/" rel="nofollow">This Is Pulp</a> has a conflict in every scene and that game is about building on each other's ideas and letting each character set the atmosphere of the session in a specific way.<br/><br/>This is kinda off topic, so I will leave it to that. Note that social contingency is <i>one</i> way of achieving <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422143#Comment_422143" rel="nofollow">uncertainty</a>, and that I'm only using it as an example, and not because I think it's superior in any way.
