The title is "A Study in Emerald". As you may imagine... yup, green blood.<br/>In the preface, Gaiman tells that he was asked by the editor to write a story merging Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and  Lovecraft's  Cthulhu Myths; he also, intelligently, points out that there is a sort of "creative conflict" between Holmes' rational world, in which eveything has a solution, and the horrific universe inhabited by the Great Old Ones, dominated by irrationality, and that just resolving the plot in one of these two directions would have been inappropriate. The solution he found is just Stunning.<br/><br/>I strongly advise to just read the story, which also won a Hugo award some years ago, you can find it on Gaiman's own website:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf</a><br/><br/>(the format is somewhat clumsy, but provides just the right flavour)<br/><br/>for those who don't want to, or can't, take the time to read it, to put it simply (SPOILER, warning!), <span style="color: #ffffff;">the world has been taken over by the Great Old Ones, who now rule over earth as the royal families. Sherlock Holmes, as any gentlemen of high culture and good sense, is perfectly in favor of this, as humans clearly cannot take care of themselves, and remitting the world's fate in the Crowned Ones' hands is the most obvious solution. There are others, though, who still strive against this god-kings, to give mankind his old freedom (blasphemous fools!). These conspirators can count some interesting names among their lines, like... Dr. Watson (Holmes' assistant is actually hinted to be Moriartry, who is usually Holmes' nemesis). EDIT: re-reading, it's apparent that holmes is on the "good" side, while the flawless detective is moriartry itself. </span><br/><br/><br/>...So, what do you think about it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255371/#Comment_255371" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T06:05:24+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  6:05AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Gaiman story also leads off an interesting collection of Yog-Sothery called <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shadows-Baker-Street-Michael-Reaves/dp/0345455282" rel="nofollow">Shadows Over Baker Street</a></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255373/#Comment_255373" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T07:57:35+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  7:57AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2010 12:19PM by Bill_White.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EDIT: Um...belated spoiler warning.

That's the story of Dracula, with the twist that he won, and has become the Queen's consort. I has several characters from fiction, including Sherlock's brother in an interesting role.<br><br/>Castle Falkenstein is a 19th century steampunk game in which all those literary characters - the man in the iron mask, count dracula, jekyll and hyde, are real and part of the world, along with additions from the world of faerie. It's a great setting.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
