Now, Fluxx is a silly cardgame, not a roleplaying game, but the themed sets have some roleplaying cards in them. In Pirate Fluxx it\u2019s the Captain\u2019s Hat, which means that everyone has to refer to you as Captain, or the Talk Like A Pirate rule, which means you get to pull and play extra cards when you talk like a pirate, and can pull and play even more if you\u2019ve been keeping it up for multiple rounds. We had a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Now, in the basic set there are some empty cards to make new rules on, and I\u2019ve been thinking about adding things like that to it. The problem is that it\u2019s not a thematic set, but a more general thing, so I\u2019m kind of stumped on what rules could be.<br/><br/>As I\u2019m typing this up, I\u2019m kind of thinking of some, but I kind of want to see what you guys can come up with to introduce a bit of roleplaying into it.<br/><br/>For those who don\u2019t know the game: Just something roleplaying wise that would guarantee a bonus would be nice.<br/><br/>For those who know the game: Go wild! It can be a rule card, goal card, action card ... It can depend on the motif-cards already in the game, etc.<br/><br/>But now I need to finish up this post, I need to go. I\u2019ll see what I can come up with myself this afternoon.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482927/#Comment_482927" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-04T19:30:26+00:00" title="May  4, 2019  7:30PM">May 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Use 3 senses to describe something.<br/>Share your inner thoughts &amp; feelings about something.<br/>Say something glum/jovial.<br/>Say something mysterious and foreboding.<br/>Say something suboptimal but authentic.<br/>Tell us a story about X.<br/>Show us how you behave as you Xing.<br/><br/>Like these?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482928/#Comment_482928" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-04T19:45:43+00:00" title="May  4, 2019  7:45PM">May 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it depends a great deal on whether you mean \u201cpeople acting or speaking in a certain way\u201d or some more intense version of \u201croleplaying\u201d (like \u201ccreating and interacting with a Shared Imagined Space\u201d).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482953/#Comment_482953" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-06T04:16:01+00:00" title="May  6, 2019  4:16AM">May 6</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">@hamnacb</a> thanks!

Like enough to make an entire new deck, and it would probably end up with a completely different game as well. It\u2019s a cool idea though, but I don\u2019t have time for that. At least not until summer vacation, and I\u2019ve been shoving quite a few projects to that period of time already. <img alt=":tongue:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":tongue:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482954/#Comment_482954" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-06T04:27:37+00:00" title="May  6, 2019  4:27AM">May 6</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... thinking about the idea <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> gave for creating a shared imaginitive space, I think I might have come up with one.<br/><br/>1) When you use your Keeper Cards as an inspiration to tell the group a single scene of a story, you may take and play an extra card. When you use your Keeper Cards as an inspiration to build on a previously established scene, progressing the story, you may take and play two extra cards.<br/><br/>2) When you play a Keeper Card and tell us a story about why it is a thing of legend, you can ignore any Keeper Limits for that card.<br/><br/>Not so sure about the second one, since in the basic set most things are mundane items or abstract concepts. Maybe I\u2019ll take a page out of the ideas <a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">@hamnacb</a> suggested and rather make it:<br/><br/>2.2: When you play a Keeper card you can ignore Keeper Limitations when you tell a personal anecdote relating to what the Keeper Card depicts.<br/><br/>It\u2019s not really roleplaying, but it\u2019s storytelling, and that\u2019s fine by me. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483026/#Comment_483026" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-08T11:35:00+00:00" title="May  8, 2019 11:35AM">May 8</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" rel="nofollow">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Hmm... thinking about the idea <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> gave for creating a shared imaginitive space, I think I might have come up with one.<br/>2.2: When you play a Keeper card you can ignore Keeper Limitations when you tell a personal anecdote relating to what the Keeper Card depicts.<br/><br/>It\u2019s not really roleplaying, but it\u2019s storytelling, and that\u2019s fine by me. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </p></div></blockquote>\nRoleplaying is a subset or form of make-believe and the borders are often very elastic.<br/>RPGs are hybrid species!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
