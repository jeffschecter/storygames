I've got some diehard Marvel fans in my group and though, they enjoy MHR, it isn't <i>quite</i> as awesome as some of the stories they've told with the AW engine. So I had the idea of coming up with doing a Marvel Heroic + Apocalypse World mash-up and was reading about how I might go about doing that by checking out <a href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno%27s">@Mcdaldno's</a> <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/simple-world/" rel="nofollow">Simple World</a>. <br/><br/>Rather than making playbooks of archetypes I was thinking of making a playbook for each specific character in the Marvelverse, depending on who the players wanted to run and the guidelines to follow in Simple World seem to work rather well. Here was what I was thinking for player moves as per Simple World and here's a datafile to follow alongside<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.boningen.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hawkeye.jpg"/><br/><br/>Player Moves:<br/><br/>-When you do something relating to [listed specialties in MHR ], add +1.<br/><br/>-You have either <br/>                       a) the ability to [MHR SFX power]. It counts as a basic move using [stat].<br/>                       b) a MHR SFX power that is a passive special power that has a constant effect.<br/>                       c) a [thing] that, when applicable, adds +1 to [stat]<br/><br/>-When you do [MHR Milestone], mark XP.<br/><br/>-Add +1 to [stat].<br/><br/><br/>How well do people see this working? Am I missing something or does this translate over pretty damn easily? Even the stats would probably work out fine.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413926/#Comment_413926" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-11T01:26:28+00:00" title="May 11, 2013  1:26AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2013 1:49AM by kksimons.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I figure take this, use Basic Moves a la Dungeon World like Defy Danger, Discern Realities, Parley, rename Hack and Slash to Fight/Engage/something better, add in Serve and Protect perhaps for a bit more heroism when rescuing or going under the gun for someone else.<br/><br/>Use the stats: Strength, Reflexes, Stamina/Durability, Presence, Intelligence<br/><br/>Going off of the MHR sheet, if they've got a d4 the stat is +0, d6 is +1, d8 is +2 and d12 is +3.<br/><br/>It'll take some creativity to make cool moves but everything can be drawn off the MHR sheet, really.

They like being proactive players and so I must assume they like the reactive role being that of the GM rather than the player. <br/><br/>I should've been clearer then in the original post. What they definitely seem to want is Marvel superheroes run in the AW engine. They love MHR and, in particular, how it makes you feel like you're playing that hero but the other bits they aren't so hot on. So, rather than a mash-up I suppose as I said, I guess it would be more like 'how can we translate an MHR character (since that's the part the players love) into an AW engine'.<br/><br/>Do you think that porting the stats and drawing inspiration for moves over like I suggested for heroes would not work for play in an AW action economy?\n<blockquote>You left out the D10 ability!<br/><br/>It should probably be:<br/>D4 = -1<br/>D6/no listed ability = +0<br/>D8 = +1<br/>D10 = +2<br/>D12 = +3<br/><br/>Now, whether or not mashing up Marvel with the *World engine is a good idea...that's debatable.

This sound like starting from the MHR side and porting in bits of the AW engine. I'll check out Smallville though.\n<blockquote>There is a hack called "The Bureau" that uses die types in a MHR way that you describe. Have you checked that out yet?</blockquote>\nI have seen it and remember thinking there were some great ideas.

Here's what I was thinking so far. Obviously many of these are straight out of DW:<br/><br/>STATS:<br/>Strength<br/>Reflexes<br/>Durability<br/>Intelligence<br/>Presence<br/>(Bond)<br/><br/>BONDS: Bonds are written out and played the same way in DW between players. Heroes also have bonds with people they love, respect or admire that are part of their personal life. Each hero starts with three points they can either put into one Bond with a person or split up between several. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPECIAL MOVES:</span><br/><br/>BURN BOND:<br/>At any time, as a free action before doing a move, a player can choose to decrease a Bond with someone by 1 in order to get an extra d6 to roll. When a player burns a bond they have either state how what they are doing is hurting their relationship with someone or frame a scene once the action ends that leads to the relationship being strained (and perhaps broken).<br/><br/>STRENGTHEN BOND:<br/>When you try to connect (or reconnect) with someone you love, respect or admire, you have to do something to prove yourself to them and win them over. This can be an action, platitudes, a date or saving them from danger. If you do it\u2026<br/>\t\u2026by being physically strong, +Str<br/>\t\u2026by acting fast, +Ref<br/>\t\u2026by enduring, +Dur<br/>\t\u2026with quick thinking, +Int<br/>\t\u2026using charm and social grace, +Pres<br/>\u2734On a 10+, your plan, speech or actions sway the person and you gain a new bond with them that starts at 1 or you can raise an existing bond by 1. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you stumble, hesitate, flinch or are forced away by other responsibilities: the bond is not formed or does not go up by 1 and now you\u2019ve got something else to deal with.<br/><br/>GET UP:<br/>When you try to get up  and not pass out or succumb to the damage you\u2019ve taken, roll the dice \u2734On a 10+, you\u2019re able to stand as long as someone is or something dear to you is in danger\u2014you\u2019re in a bad spot but you\u2019re still alive. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you can only get up if you can keep your enemy talking and in monologue for 2 minutes.. \u2734On 6-, your fate is sealed and you have no control what your enemies do to you and those you failed to protect. The GM will tell you what happens.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BASIC MOVES:</span><br/><br/>ASSEMBLE:<br/>When you in trouble you can call your fellow heroes for help. Roll+bond. \u2734On a 10+, they are immediately available and show up right away \u2734On a 7\u20139, you\u2019re on your own for a turn. <br/><br/>SEEK OUT DANGER:<br/>When you go on patrol or go looking for trouble to stop roll+Pres. \u2734On a 10+, you either find the kind of trouble you\u2019re looking for, or have the initiative to act as the trouble does not yet know about you. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you get more than you bargain for and stumble onto more trouble than you can handle but can send out for help. On a 6- you don\u2019t have any time to call for help and are in over your head.<br/><br/>BE NORMAL:<br/>When you try to be normal and go about your daily routine make a roll. \u2734On a 10+, no trouble or danger finds you as you go about your daily routine. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you stumble onto something or someone (trouble) that requires you dropping what you were about to do. On a 6- you are thrown into trouble and are in a tricky situation.<br/><br/>SUBDUE:  <br/>When you attack an enemy in melee, roll+Str. \u2734On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy\u2019s attack. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.<br/><br/>TAKE DOWN: <br/>When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll+Ref. \u2734On a 10+, you have a clear shot\u2014deal your damage. \u2734On a 7\u20139, choose one (whichever you choose you deal your damage):<br/>\tYou have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described by the GM<br/>\tYou have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage<br/>\tYou have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one<br/><br/>DEFY DANGER:<br/>When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it\u2026<br/>\t\u2026by powering through, +Str<br/>\t\u2026by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Ref<br/>\t\u2026by enduring, +Dur<br/>\t\u2026with quick thinking, +Int<br/>\t\u2026through mental fortitude, +Int<br/>\t\u2026using charm and social grace, +Pres<br/><br/>\u2734On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn\u2019t come to bear. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.<br/><br/>SERVE AND PROTECT:<br/>When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack, roll+Dur. \u2734On a 10+, hold 3. \u2734On a 7\u20139, hold 1. As long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:<br/>\tRedirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself<br/>\tHalve the attack\u2019s effect or damage<br/>\tOpen up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker<br/>\tDeal damage to the attacker equal to your level<br/>\tCreate or advance a bond with the person you are protecting by 1<br/><br/>PUT IT TOGETHER:<br/>When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+Int. \u2734On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. \u2734On a 7\u20139, the GM will only tell you something interesting\u2014it\u2019s on you to make it useful.

After one day of rest you remove one debility of your choice. If you\u2019re under the care of a healer (magical or otherwise) you heal two debilities for every day of rest instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413961/#Comment_413961" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-12T01:23:51+00:00" title="May 12, 2013  1:23AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2013 1:46AM by robb.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [controversy redacted] did you look at<br/><a href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/images/stories/games/just_heroes.pdf" rel="nofollow">Just Heroes</a> - James Mullen <br/><br/>I've not looked at it but maybe you'll get some ideas there?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414512/#Comment_414512" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-22T04:42:10+00:00" title="May 22, 2013  4:42AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2013 4:53AM by kksimons.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[controversy redacted] did you look at<br/><a href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/images/stories/games/just_heroes.pdf" rel="nofollow">Just Heroes</a> - James Mullen <br/><br/>I've not looked at it but maybe you'll get some ideas there?</blockquote>\nThanks! It looks like he went another way then I'm ending up though.<br/><br/>This has totally ended up just turning into a Supers hack for Dungeon World. I'm going to get some playbooks down soon and playtest with some of the guys soon. Here's what I'm thinking so far:<br/><br/>PLAYBOOKS (CLASSES): (I'm probably going to go with Scrapper, Leader, Outsider, Avatar, Guardian for the base 5 playbooks to come up with first)<br/> <br/><del>THE VIGILANTE (Daredevil, Punisher)</del><br/>THE GENIUS (Reed Richards, Tony Stark)<br/>THE OUTSIDER (Superman, Silver Surfer, Hulk)<br/>THE GUARDIAN/KNIGHT (Colossus, Thing)<br/>THE LEADER/PATRIOT/SAVIOR (Cyclops, Captain America)<br/><del>THE AVENGER/VIGILANTE (early Spider-Man, Namor) </del><br/><del>THE PROGRAMMED/MACHINE (Vision, Deathlock)</del><br/>THE VISIONARY (Prof X, Magneto)<br/>THE AVATAR (Thor, Captain Marvel, Hercules)<br/>THE REBEL/UNWILLING (Luke Cage, Emma Frost, Human Torch, Bobby Drake)<br/>THE BEAST (Hulk, Beast, Wolverine)<br/><del>THE SCRAPPER (Wolverine)</del> <br/><br/>So there'd be moves for to show their motivations and such in their playbooks, then they can also choose moves within the following subsets (probably have been playing too much Avengers Alliance but for now the names are:) to show off and use their powers with.<br/><br/>BLASTER (range attacks)<br/>BRUISER (melee attacks)<br/>TACTICIAN (create advantages/disadvantages/debilities)<br/>INFILTRATOR (freedom of movement, surprise, stealth)<br/>UTILITY (Knowledge and flavor, World Building stuff) <br/><br/>After choosing moves from within these lists, they'll be able to apply tags to show their "power type" or their character concept. Power types being things like - blaster, psychic, gadgeteer/tech, speedster, ghost, mutation, power cosmic, etc.<br/> <br/>FRONTS (same as DW)<br/> <br/>XP: They are rewarded with XP when they a) use a move for the first time that session, b) unlock an achievement (milestone-type activities), c) 6- rolls. XP can be used to write in new moves, unlock side-missions or extra goodies during an ongoing story front.<br/><br/>A lot of the MC moves should work fine but I'm going to come up with more stuff for putting loved ones/ bystanders in harms way, messing with weaknesses, powers, their secret identity or other secrets, etc.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414513/#Comment_414513" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-22T04:56:30+00:00" title="May 22, 2013  4:56AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you are on a far better track with this go around.<br/><br/>Are you keeping the DW stat names?

Started adding in more general moves to choose from if players want to round out some moves outside of their class moves. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AjUo7YohqX32OXX6HUldtPeHQUmCz59OXYCxZv5bPRU/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Worlds in Peril</a><br/><br/>Verbs as Stats:<br/>Smash (strength, power, brute force)<br/>Influence (social, creating advantages/disadvantages)<br/>Maneuver (stealth, speed)<br/>Protect (defensive actions, yourself or others)<br/>Investigate (search, world building, tracking, intelligence and reason)<br/>(Bond)<br/><br/>PAIN AND DAMAGE: There are 3 things that can happen as a result of a character taking on damage in the fiction. The first is pain, when very incidental damage needs to be reflected in fiction. The second is a condition, which reflects pain and injuries by imposing a disadvantage on a character when they try to do certain things. The third is heavy damage, when the damage is big and lethal enough to kill a character. The EiC will let a player know what kind of damage they take and what they should do as a result of it.<br/><br/>(1) When you take incidental damage, roll+protect.<br/>On a 10+, no big deal.<br/>On a 7-9, it kinda stings. Choose one from pain.<br/>On a miss, that came out of nowhere. Choose one from pain and the EiC will choose another.<br/><br/>pain:<br/>You get some cuts and bruises<br/>You lose your footing or position<br/>You lose your grip on whatever you\u2019re holding<br/>You lose track of, or miss noticing, something important [usually EiC\u2019s choice only]<br/><br/>-The pain list is purely fictional considerations, nothing mechanical in terms of penalties but something does happen in the fiction. You may only choose an item from the list of pain once. Once you've chosen one of them at least once (and they have not been dealt with yet), you must choose a condition instead.<br/><br/>(2) Conditions are taken on when the EiC tells you to choose a condition as either a result of your own move or as a result of something happening in the fiction (a villain blasting you into a skyscraper, a particularly nasty spat with a girlfriend, an alien death-ray sending out radiation from space, etc.)<br/><br/>example conditions:<br/>-dazed<br/>-slowed<br/>-dislocated shoulder<br/>-sprained ankle<br/>-frozen in place<br/>-buried under rubble (trapped)<br/>-tired<br/><br/>-Conditions are fictional considerations that have mechanical weight behind them. For a player, it means they take a -1 to their rolls that involve the condition until they are dealt with. For an adversary, it means they get a +1 on their rolls that take advantage of a condition (and vice versa when players impose conditions on their adversaries). This list is by no means the only conditions that can be imposed - it could be anything under the sun, especially since it\u2019s a game about superheroes. Conditions can be anything from emotions like \u201cangry\u201d, or \u201ccold and unfeeling\u201d to a machine the villain uses on players so that everything they hear is amplified a thousand fold! They are circumstances imposed on a character in the fiction and then have a mechanical weight behind them when they are brought up. If my player has the condition \u201cdislocated shoulder\u201d, it wouldn't hinder my ability to shoot laser beams from my eyes, so I wouldn't have a penalty to do that. However, if I wanted to punch someone in the face, I\u2019d definitely be taking a -1 to that. These conditions do not affect the amount of damage a player does, just the roll when making a move.<br/><br/><br/>(3) Heavy damage: a player takes heavy damage when the EiC tells them to do so (they may ask a player to roll the damage or may just tell them to take a certain amount of heavy damage). Most heroes can take up to 10 damage before their body shuts down on them and they have to make the Last Chance move. When a player takes damage they can mitigate the damage and reduce it by 2 by taking a condition that puts them at a disadvantage all the time for -1. Players can do this only until they have a total of -3 on their rolls, after that, the characters must take on all the damage received. Players must name their condition as best suits what happened in the fiction and apply it to all their rolls, including damage                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415776/#Comment_415776" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T05:12:55+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  5:12AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting better and better!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416455/#Comment_416455" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T04:45:52+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  4:45AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alrighty, so one of the players and I put together some character sheets for use in the game, made up a list of basic moves and a GM (Editor-in-Chief sheet) and I whipped up a playtest doc!

Many of the stronger moves are sticking around but we've tightened up damage in general and did something new with playbooks. We ended up making mini-books instead of playbooks and there are two kinds of playbooks - Origin books and Drive books. When you create a character you choose an Origin playbook "I became a superhero because of..." and you can choose from books like "the experiment", "a death in the family", "the deal", "what I know" and so on. You then also choose a Drive book to supplement that "It is my goal and drive to..." and you choose from books like "lead", "change the future", "mentor", "rebel", "see justice done" and so on. <br/><br/>So a lot of the good moves are still there but we made a bunch more as well and put them into the various books so that you can really customize and come up with the hero you're looking for. You also can also unlock, take additional or drop Drive playbooks (or even be reborn or retconned and take a different Origin book) when you hit certain milestones and other fictional considerations. Some Drives might have require having another Drive first as well, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GilboD" title="GilboD"><img alt="GilboD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GilboD">GilboD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428667/#Comment_428667" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-23T16:57:38+00:00" title="February 23, 2014  4:57PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did this finish beta?
