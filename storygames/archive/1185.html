<blockquote><b>Fastlane</b> is an excellent game.  I have no doubt in my mind about that.  In a recent thread, Ralph agreed, saying "This is a game that needs to be promoted more, and [we] need to pay more attention to it."  And he's not the only one who's said good things about it. Yet, it sold zero copies this year at GenCon.  Let me repeat that: <i>zero</i>.  IPR might not even have brought my books to the convention, and that sucks.<br/><br/>After writing <b>Fastlane</b> I switched jobs, got into a motorcycle accident, got fired, went back to school, and drowned in academia.  Not to mention a car crashed through the front of my house.  While these are not really good excuses, they all contributed to me both dropping the ball, and then not getting around to picking it back up.  This is me saying I'm picking that ball up.  This is me also saying that I can't do it alone.<br/><br/>Tony's Capes demo has inspired me, and by next year at GenCon (or maybe even Dreamation if I can make it there, if they do the 'free crash space' thing for indie designers they did last year) I will have a little demo box with chips, and cards with pre-arranged bids, whether or not I'm there to do it myself.  It will hopefully be made so that anyone can grab it, hand out the appropriate cards, and run the quick demo.  Anyone at all.  I<br/><br/>'m also working on a second, revised version of <b>Fastlane</b> - I've already let that cat out of the bag, and there's no way to put it back in. I'm getting a new cover, adding a lot of clarifying text.  But there's almost forty copies of the first printing still around, and IPR sells about ten a quarter, though as IPR grows, probably so will my game's sales.  Still, that means what, a year before <b>Fastlane</b> is sold out, and the new print run ordered?  I know we can make that happen faster, so that next year, the new <b>Fastlane</b> cover will be on IPR's shelves, with me hopefully backing it with demos and scheduled events.<br/><br/>As the recent GenCon threads seem to have illustrated, games often live or die by generated buzz, preferably honest, knowledgeable buzz.  The best buzz that can serve Fastlane right now, the buzz it needs, is <i>Actual Play</i>.  My plan to create a demo, and to schedule <b>Fastlane</b> events, is a direct result of that realization. Maybe even more than most games, people need to be shown that awesome things happen as a result of playing this game.  Potential customers need to see that the wheel is not a hindrance, but an enabler - and they need to see that there's no reason to avoid the game without the wheel, because of the awesome system using six-siders that I'm so proud of creating.  Yes, the wheel is better, but it is not so much better that people should avoid this game.<br/><br/>If you own this game, and have played it - please, post your Actual Play (or provide me with links if it's been posted somewhere I can't find, like on the blogosphere) or otherwise talk it up.  If you own it and are thinking of a new game to play, try <b>Fastlane</b> and let me know how it goes.  Don't let the lack of a wheel stop you!<br/><br/>Also:  Marketing is not my strong point.  For those of you who love the game as much as I do, please, help me formulate a good elevator pitch that might snag someone who's not interested in the minutiae of the mechanics, that won't scare away people the moment they hear 'roulette wheel'.  Something that will impress Robin Laws when he shows up at the booth next year.  <br/><br/>And if you have other, additional ways I can help get word of <b>Fastlane</b>'s awesomeness to the people, please share it.  Thank you!</blockquote> </div>

Here comes the feedback hammer. Strap yourself in to the Chair of Discomfort!
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lxndr</cite>Don't let the lack of a wheel stop you!  Help me formulate a good elevator pitch...that won't scare away people the moment they hear 'roulette wheel'</blockquote>
Throw away the wheel.<br/><br/>Seriously. Take it behind the shed and shoot it behind the ear.<br/><br/>If you're revising the game, it's the first thing that Needs to Go.<br/><br/>I just remember the looks of the congoers when we told them "Hey, this game is all about 'Live Fast, Die Young' ". They're hooked. Then they see the roulette wheel, and the eyes glaze over. When they sit in the session, sure they have fun, their opinion flips back, of course.  But it's not easy to sell a game where "You need a roulette wheel to play". Scratch that, it's <b>nearly impossible</b> to sell a game where you need a roulette wheel to play.<br/><br/>Sure, there are optional rules for dice in the back (depending on Euro or US style roulette), but they were kinda muddled, and they're just "off" enough to feel like, "Well, we sorta get the same experience, but it's not the same without the wheel". I don't have the book in front of me, but IIRC the dice were always off a bit from the wheel. Like there was a result or two that didn't quite match up with the wheel itself.<br/><br/>So, I'm thinking for the revised game, keep the betting mat (though I suggest doing what I did and creating a downloadable PDF of a roulette wheel split across about 4-5 pieces of paper, which can be printed then taped together so that you can stack poker chips right on the paper rather than teeny little tokens). Keep the core mechanics.  Change up the game so that the 2d6 (or other die role mechanic) Simulates the odds of the roulette wheel in a non-wonky way (keeping the "2d6 == Which Roulette Wheel result" chart is fine, just keep it on every character sheet like you do now). Make it totally dependent on the dice, emphasize that it takes Roulette-style betting and simulates it with dice.  Then, at the end of the book, drop in some optional rules for "If you have or want to buy a roulette wheel...". Run ALL your demos with the dice, maybe only bring out the wheel for special demos.<br/><br/>Something that wards me off the wheel is this: I am not interested in roulette at all outside the scope of the Fastlane RPG (as opposed to Mah Jongg, cards, dominos, poker (chips) etc all of which I play when not using the pieces for RPGs). When I started getting games that used poker-chip like tokens, I went to eBay and ordered a set of casino style 11.7g chips. I love the feel of the real deal.  I play PTA and Dust Devils with real (retired) casino cards.  When I saw Fastlane originally, and realized that a crappy-crappy-crappy cheap plastic wheel was like $20-30, and that a "somewhat balanced and realistic one" was WAY more expensive, I pretty much decided to play with dice.<br/><br/>Now this was like 2 years ago mind you, right after I bought the game. But I was really uncomfortable with the handling involved in the dice.<br/><br/>And it's not just me. People see the cheap plastic wheel and all the cheap plastic tokens and go "...............eh." It smells like a gimmick, a one trick pony that tries to sell you on the resolution mechanic tool and not the style of play it encourages.<br/><br/>What you need to do, if you WANT to sell the game hard is revamp the rules to make a painless 2d6 (or other die mechanic) control the roulette betting chart, with a minimum of wonkery ("in the case of a 6, reroll with 1-3 being X and 4-6 being Y" is about as far as I'd go). Build the game around the betting map and dice, and make the wheel clearly the "second choice", with "optional rules".  <br/><br/>That's the main thing, I think.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I'll echo what Andy said.  Fastlane hooked me with its evocative description on IPR but the wheel stopped me from even thinking of buying it.  I think the game could be awesome, but I know my group would never touch the system as it stands with a ten foot pole.  Lose the wheel and I know of at least one more person who will buy your game and spread the word about it, both on the net and in person.                        </div>

<b>Fastlane</b> has always had support for not using the wheel.  The dice system available in the book is the absolute minimum wonkery possible, and honestly follows the roulette odds for every option <i>precisely</i> down to, like, the tenth of a percentage point.  I've already been pondering increasing the visibility of the dicing version of the game, up to and including using the dice in the demos rather than the mini-wheel I used in 2004.  But the dice system is already as good as it's going to get; imho, as good as it <i>can</i> get. That you found them muddled, Andy, means I definitely should make them clearer, something I've already been doing with that part of the book.  <br/><br/>In short, I agree that it is "<b>nearly impossible</b>" to sell a game that requires a roulette wheel, which is why I'm looking to de-emphasize the wheel and show potential customers that, while the roulette wheel is very nice, it is not <i>required</i> by any stretch of the imagination (and honestly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never has been</span>).  Obviously I need to play that up more, because while having a wheel gives the best atmosphere, it's unrealistic to expect the average person to want to get one; there needs to be much more promotion on the aspect of the system that's alwas been there - <i>the dice</i>.<br/><br/>Anyway, to share my awesome dice system, here's the short form:
<ul>
<li>Player:  Roll two six-sided dice, of different colors. The lighter of the two dice dictates what column to use, the darker dictates what row to use, giving a number between one and thirty-six.<br/></li><li>Croupier:  Rolls two six-sided dice.  If he rolls snake eyes, the result is a zero instead of the number the player rolled.  For an American wheel, if he rolls snake eyes or boxcars, with boxcars being double-zero.<br/></li></ul>
This gives odds that are different on the <i>tenth</i> of a percentage point in the worst case scenario (0.3% more likely to get a zero using the American wheel version) and a <i>thousandth</i> of a percentage point in the best case scenarios (0.002% less likely to get a particular non-zero number on the European version).  The only thing it lacks is the natural 'timer' that the roulette wheel gives from ball bouncing start to finish.<br/><br/>The system gets <i>slightly</i> more complex in the <b>Fastlane</b> rules because <b>Fastlane</b> uses a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">handicap</span> system to give each player a different number, both with the wheel and with the dice.  No more than one person can get a zero at the same time, but the chances for any one person to get the same zero remains the same.<br/><br/>On the wheel, the handicap means you move along the wheel for each person from where the ball stopped.  With the dice version, each player is given a different number to look for (so, say, double 1s are zeroes for one player, double 2s for the 2nd player, etc) but the odds of each player getting a zero remains the same.  So, the only difference is that each player is watching for his own personal numbers on the Croupiers dice, instead of everyone looking for the same ones.<br/><br/>Now, maybe I'm too close to the system, but as far as I can tell, on a pure numbers level, the dice system isn't "off" at all.  I'm toning down the part that says "but you should get a wheel" though.                        </div>

                            Do you have a name for the die mechanic, Alexander? Like, if you can say "This game uses Roulette Dice!" that simultaneously says roulette, with the gambling association that brings; assures people that familiar dice will be used; and suggests that the dice are a major, well-thought out component, worthy to be used on their own and not a second-best replacement. I'm sure someone could come up with a much cooler name as well (maybe you already have...).                        </div>

                            Working on that right now, Matthjis.  I'm getting proposals for a new cover for <b>Fastlane</b>'s next printing.  Hopefully this is the only time I ever change covers between printings of any game I make.<br/><br/>Jake, the wheel is most definitely <i>not</i> going away.  But I think I will be playing up the dicing scheme that's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> been there, making it more visible and accessible for those people who aren't me.  (After all, I bought my sixteen inch roulette wheel before <b>Fastlane</b> was even a twinkle in my eye, just 'cause I thought "oh, nifty, roulette wheel, why the heck not?" while browsing through a game website - many people <i>don't do that</i>, and I don't blame them).  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Jasper, there's no particular name for the dice mechanic.  They're just "<b>Fastlane</b> dice: roulette style!"  They are definitely a well-thought-out component, however, and totally worthy to be used.  While I do think using the wheel is better, I put a lot of work into getting the dice system to work just right and it kind of hurts that so many people choose to eschew the game entirely rather than use the alternative dicing scheme that is <i>just as good</i> on a purely mechanical level.<br/><br/>Of course, while I'll probably be using the dice for all the demos at the booth, I'll probably still bring my Official Portable Vegas Kit (which is much nicer than the dinky wheel you saw two years ago, Andy) for ticketed events and any after-hours play.  Because the wheel <i>does</i> add something to the game, and I want to give people the full experience.                        </div>

<p>"Roulettte Dice" seems like a fine name. Or maybe "six-sider roulette". I think one way to frame the mechanic in the text is something like "I wanted to capture the nailbiting excitement of the Roulette Wheel with something simple like dice, and this is what I got." For demos, you should stick with the dice, for the most part... except for the last few minutes of the demo, where you whip out the big wheel and say "okay, here's something special for you guys".</p>

                            Hm.  I like "Six-sider roulette."  Consider it yoinked.<br/><br/>As for demos... if I'm to stick within the Ten Minute Demo ideal, I don't think I'll have time to pull out a wheel at any point.  That's okay, I'm okay with that.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lxndr</cite>The system gets<i>slightly</i>more complex in the<b>Fastlane</b>rules because<b>Fastlane</b>uses a<span style="text-decoration: underline;">handicap</span>system to give each player a different number, both with the wheel and with the dice.

Ahhh, I think THAT was it, not the dice (sorry, my thoughts on the game have been in the fridge for about 18 months. Yeah, with the dice so close to mimicing the real percentages, and able to throw down quickly, that's not much of a problem at all).  So yeah, as you say above the dice weren't that hard. But I remember that there was some component of the rules somewhere that DID work better with the wheel, and DIDN'T work well with the dice.  Maybe that was it?  I dunno, I'd have to see the rules again (I can't find my copy now), but I do remember that there were <b>something</b> in the rules that made one think twice about playing with the dice, as they didn't add up quite as well, and maybe would require a pinch of re-engineering.<br/><br/>But, here's some coolness, check this out: If you go the full-on dice route:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.koplowgames.com/page3.html" rel="nofollow">Precision Casino dice</a>. So you'll still get that casino feel, maybe using the blue and yellow together as a set (for the dark/light dice).  Here's a page of "non prescision", which are just as good for the game but not as good if you were opening a real casino or something:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.koplowgames.com/page5.html" rel="nofollow">Non-precision gorgeous casino dice</a><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Generally speaking, I wouldn't sweat the percentages so long as the game behavior is within 1% (or for me, even 10%) of the wheel-behavior. It's a good feature that it works, though.</p>

                            Andy,<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, even reviewing the original rules, the only thing <i>missing</i> with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Six Sided Roulette</span> is the natural timing element the roulette wheel gives.  Instead of dropping a ball and going 'here, bid until it stops', the GM/Croupier has to, like, count down from twenty to one or something.  Maybe I'm just too close to it, though.<br/><br/>Right now I will be going full-on dice for <b>Fastlane</b> demos, at least.  Those are pretty links!  Yay dice!  (Like I don't have enough... *groans*)                        </div>

                            Also, Koplow sells 30-second sand timers, which might work in there as well. <br/><br/>Hmmm. I could have sworn there was somethingorother about the roulette vs the character rules, like the way everyone had their own number... Ah, maybe it was a mistake on my own part: Like in my head, I was thinking "Everyone Rolls their own ROulette Dice", which would do weird things to resolution if I hit Alexander's Secret number, and Alexander hits mine at the same time, etc. So that might have been me misreading the rules...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I'll definitely strive to make that clearer in the text, then, Andy.  Perhaps it already is, with my changes.<br/><br/>I've already modified at least one example of play to use the dice instead of the wheel, just to show off how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Six-Sided Roulette</span> works.                        </div>
