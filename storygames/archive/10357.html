In these scenes, the character is often building or scavenging something (it's a post apocalyptic game). Let's say the character builds a car. This car will have a mechanical effect later in the game and these scenes are meant to be some slow buildup and establishing scenes. There's a roll to see how good a car you build, too.<br/><br/>The problem is, it's very easy to just say "I build a car" and then roll the dice and end your scene. In fact, it's very hard to sit and describe how you're building the car with the other players just listening. That sort of monologueing doesn't come naturally.<br/><br/>Think of those montage scenes in movies where you show lots of clips of the car getting built, until it's finished. How can I get that in a game? I suspect I should get the other players involved in the process, but how?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230324/#Comment_230324" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-06T23:53:08+00:00" title="September  6, 2009 11:53PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To quote from St. Harper, in the book of Blackbird:<br/>\n<br/>\n"When you\u2019re the GM, don\u2019t try to plan what will happen.

I think the advice you got about the GM asking questions is a solid one. Perhaps you could find some way to reward the other players for asking sensible questions instead? Something like a small reward whenever the controlling player chooses to answer a question because it makes their scene more interesting. You'd probably also need to limit the amount of questions to keep the ball rolling though.<br/><br/>I like the concept of scenes with specific purposes myself. The game I just finished working on used a similar mechanic to help build tension and mistrust amongst the players. Works pretty well.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230331/#Comment_230331" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T00:27:10+00:00" title="September  7, 2009 12:27AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Pettersson</cite>Think of those montage scenes in movies where you show lots of clips of the car getting built, until it's finished.

This is a fun writing exercise to do in general, and it works just as well with more than one person: just take turns contributing a single image or moment of action. Try to build up a slow but steady rhythm, go around the circle once or twice or until the primary player decides to cut the scene... and then roll.<br/><br/>You could weight the descriptive responsibilities somehow too, so that the primary player does a mini-monologue and other players contribute single details -- or borrow a page from Archipelago ("describe that in more detail") and have the other players call out <i>questions</i> that the primary player responds to in order to build the scene. This way the other players control the level of detail and where that detail is focused, as well as providing the primary player with constraints &amp; prompts to play off of in their description.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230332/#Comment_230332" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T00:35:55+00:00" title="September  7, 2009 12:35AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite>This is...

Then he remembers there's that old junked street racer at the dump, one that looked like it might still have something useful in it, so he walks down the street..." etc.<br/><br/>Otherwise, coming up with something unstructured, without any sort of guidance on what kinds of parts or what features the player works on... yeah, I can see that being really hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230388/#Comment_230388" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T09:21:16+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  9:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jonathan, that's very helpful.

Is he humming a tune? What tune? Does that tool he is using remind him of someone or somewhere? This could even lead to a flash back scene. Or is he worried about a coming confrontation? A simple rule for encouraging colour is to give a bonus for each of the five senses that are involved in the description.<br/><br/>You could also go for conflict and building tension. You could take this so far as to cross cut between building the thingy and using the thingy. Or make it a race against the clock, cutting between the approaching doom and the construction work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230423/#Comment_230423" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T12:19:07+00:00" title="September  7, 2009 12:19PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a reason montage scenes are montage scenes and not actual scenes - because watching someone build a car (or train with kung fu or whatever) is completely fucking boring.

Boring montage scenes are boring. The endgame of Fiasco is awesome, and it's just a structure for a montage scene. (Basically, for each die you have at the end of the game, usually about 4 dice, you get one "cut" in a montage that tells the epilogue of the story, constrained by the events in the fiction to that point plus an oracular paragraph about how good or bad the outcome is for your guy.) The trick is to have something to say for which a montage is an appropriate expression. So sure, "I build a car. I roll a 20. The car is cool." is boring. But:<br/>Car-builder player: "OK, I'm building a super spy car. I roll a 20! So this car... [points left]"<br/>Player 2: "That car is a junkyard Camaro, but under the dust, the hood decals are still mint."<br/>P3: "It makes a sweet roar when you finally get the engine back to life!"<br/>P4: "I look at my watch - it's midnight, and you're installing a nitro bottle, like you don't even know what time it is. I get on the other creeper and kiss you under the car."<br/>CBP: "And together, we install the sweet James Bond rear-facing machine guns?"<br/>P4: "And the oil-slick generator!"<br/>P3: "Awesome! The ejection seats, right? Test 'em with mannequins, whole team is there the next day, high-fives all around!"<br/>P2: "Bitchin' Camaro! Scene?"<br/>ALL: "Scene!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
