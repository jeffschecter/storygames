                    I've been working on rules for 'The Believers', a game of normal people grasping with alien encounters.  I am gearing it towards play with non-gamers and trying to decide whether a GM is really necessary.  But before I got in-depth with mechanics, I wanted to try the basic premise on someone.  My fiance Rachel was in the kitchen fixing pasta for dinner and was my perfect target!  She is definitely what we would call a non-gamer, and prefers Backgammon or Gin Rummy to those new-fangled games I bring home like Carcassonne.<br/><br/>So after dinner we sat in front of the fire drinking 12-year Rum and I told her I wanted to try out the game I was working on.  We had watched 'Signs' the night before so she wasn't so surprised.  I told her that we were both going to play characters who didn't know each other, but that we both had something in common.  We had an encounter of some kind with aliens and we had become 'Believers'.  We had company coming over soon, but she was game to try.  Which was cool because I wanted to gauge her reaction to things in gaming sessions that we take for granted.<br/><br/><i>First I said we needed to decide a place and I time for this to happen.  She didn't understand at first, until I gave some examples like Ohio in the 50s or India in the 80s.  I asked her opinion and she thought about it for a moment before answering "Pasadena in the 1950s."  I said that was cool and asked her why she liked it.  She explained that the UFO phenomena was starting by then and it was close to Hollywood.  Then she said, "Oh, I want to change my mind, I like Ohio in the 50s actually."  I said she didn't have to change her mind, that we were just brainstorming.  She seemed a little confused about who was going to make the ultimate decision.<br/><br/>I through out a few ideas like "postwar Tokyo" and "modern day Brazil" just to open up the possibilities.  She seemed to get that and said "I think it would be interesting to play in a time before everyone knew about these things.  Like before they even knew about the planets."  I thought that was intriguing.  "Like maybe Italy in the 1600s?"  She seemed a little concerned.  "Yeah, but I wouldn't really know what things were like back then."  I told her that was okay since we were just creating our own story.  I asked her to choose between Italy in the 1600s and the Midwest US in the 1950s and she said she couldn't decide.  But I read the tea leaves and could tell she would be more comfortable with a time and place closer to home.  "So what about 1956 in a small mining town in Montana.  Maybe close to an Air Force base?"  She lit up.  "Yeah, that sounds great!"<br/><br/>"Ok, so next you need to create your character...your Believer.  Think about it for a minute and just tell me their name and what they do.  Just a little bit about them."  She wanted to think uninterrupted for a few minutes about that question.  Then she surprised me by coming up with a really nice back story.  "Her name is Abigail Miller and she is 24 years old.  She has been married for about 4 years to a man who works at the bank.  A pretty nice job for such a small town.  She has two young kids" (I forget their ages) "and they live in a nice house in town."  She gave a little more detail and then let me have my chance.  <br/><br/>I told her about Ron, a 50-something man who lives outside of town with his son's family.  Ron was involved in a mining accident awhile back and walks with a cane.  He was forced to stop working long before he was ready and while he feels lucky to be living with his son, he feels that he has been a burden on them.<br/><br/>So then I asked her to describe her first close encounter.  I said that she could give as much or little detail as she wanted, but that when she was done she could define just one aspect of the aliens or their craft.  Again she thought hard for a moment and then started.  "Abigail was driving home one night from a birthday party at her cousin's house in the next town.  Her husband couldn't come because he had to work late and the kids were being watched by a friend, so she was alone.  It seemed that there was some sort of storm going on, with lighting.  But that wasn't unusual in this part of the country.  Anyway, as she drove the lightning got brighter and more focused.  And suddenly she saw the aliens flying down towards her car.  She had taken a creative writing class in college.  You know, she was an uppity girl for being in college back then anyway.  But in her writing class she had written a story about UFOs.  And just then she started to wonder whether doing the research for that story had caused this to happen in some way."<br/><br/>"Abigail was scared, but also very curious too.  The UFO was right in front of her car, and she had to stop.  The light from the craft was very bright, and suddenly it flew away.  She paused in that spot for quite awhile before going on, not sure if what she had seen was real.  But inside she knew that it was..."<br/><br/>"Very cool!  So what aspect would you like to define from that story?"  She didn't seem to understand what I was asking.  And then our friends came over to the house and suddenly it was entertaining time, so I didn't get a chance to talk to her about it until just before bed.<br/><br/>"So what did you think of the game so far?"  She thought about it and said, "It really hard thinking up all of that stuff."</i><br/><br/>--<br/><br/>So I didn't get to tell the story of Ron's first encounter, and we didn't get into any subsequent scenes, but I was able to get some interesting feedback (if from one person).  <br/>-She wasn't used to brainstorming about the setting and time.  She thought she was being asked to make a decision.  And even after I told her it was collaborative, she was still thinking that one of us would make the final decision.<br/>-She really thought a lot about Abigail's back story and tried to breath life into the character instead of just creating a 1-2 sentence skeleton.<br/>-She had a little trouble coming up with a first contact story, but once she started she got engaged, and made an attempt to tie the situation into the Abigail's back story to add more color.<br/>-She seemed put off that she had to distill her cool first contact story into one single piece of "knowledge" about the aliens.  I feel that she wanted the encounter to stand on it's own.<br/><br/>So what did I learn?  Well besides the fact that Rachel is awesome to sit around telling UFO stories with her crazy game-designing fiance, I found that her tolerance for structure was perhaps different than mine.  She was really looking for structure and when she didn't find any, she pushed in some interesting directions.  But one she opened things up creatively, she was sensitive to then being constrained or edited.  Hmm..so maybe we aren't so different!<br/><br/>The interesting part for me will be turning this style of storytelling into a game with mechanics and scenes and ways to resolve conflict.  I feel like a lot of non-gamers will get easily overwhelmed by too many rules.  But since they are not used to opening the creative floodgates, I feel like a lack of structure will cause a lot of "uh..so what do I do now?"  It's a big challenge but a very interesting one from my standpoint.<br/><br/>Thoughts from anyone?<br/><br/>Chris B.                </div>

                            My first thought is to limit the choices that need to be made. Maybe provide a set of settings to start the game with that theycan choose from. it might be easyest to have Roswell be the default starting point for the introduction, t5hen give them guidelines on how to make up other locations. <br/><br/>The initial setting could include a bunch of factual stuff and speculative stuff and a really rough map so that you can say where things happen. <br/><br/>1. Roswell is located in the south-east quarter of New Mexico<br/>2. Ranchers had seen lights in the sky on and off for months before July 1947<br/>3. On July second something crashes <br/>4. On July 8th the Army heads out into the desert and recovers material from the crash site<br/>5. Papers announce that the army has captured a flying saucer<br/>6. The army announces that the items are from a weather ballooon<br/><br/>So where does your characters story touch the facts? Who are you and where do you come from? What are you giving up to be here?<br/><br/>Then draw off each other and at the end of each description agree on the facts and move forward. I'm sure that you already have stuff that you want to explore so set the first scenario up to focus your "facts" so that the players can grab stuff and run.                        </div>
