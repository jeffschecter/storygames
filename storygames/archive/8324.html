This seems valuable to me, because I think understanding why a rule exists (or at least what the intent is) might be a powerful way to clarify the rule itself and to pull disparate tables closer to the intended play. I don't see that a lot in games, though, and I wonder if there is a deliberate effort to excise that? Do we not want to see the man behind the curtain?

For example, if a game says "If you think the declared action of another player is especially creative, you can spend a stone to increase their chance of success." Is that a rule which I must follow? Or is it advice by the designer suggesting a way that the rules can be applied? What if I think the declared action is creative but I don't want them to succeed?<br/><br/>Count me as preferring rules which state what must be done; leave the designer's notes and advice for the back of the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183809/#Comment_183809" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T18:08:07+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  6:08PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff; thank you.

It's possible there needs to be two texts.<br/><br/>I'm going to churn through the text I have and try to distill the "rules" as rigid, referable statements governing play and then mess with ways to present both objectives.

What you are writing is instructions, not rules like one might find in a boardgame.<br/><br/>Consequently, your priority should not be to make your "rules" clear. Your priority should be to make your intent clear. Players who don't understand why the rules are as they are will misinterpret anyway, as it is pretty difficult to follow instructions you don't understand. People routinely leave rules out of rpgs, and I can't blame them - when even after reading the whole book you don't know what the designer was trying to do, it's pretty easy to just choose your own intent and pick and choose the rules you yourself think will support your goals. Combine this with the fact that historically rpg writers routinely lie to their audience by writing untested rules or rules they themselves wouldn't use or rules that are for different purposes than the other rules in the same book, and it's no wonder if rpgs are difficult to utilize.<br/><br/>For an example of this phenomenon, there are something like half a dozen roleplaying game designers in Finland. Of these a full third have said in public that they don't actually use the rules of the games they write - they just write the sort of rules they believe people expect and want, but who uses rules in actual play, anyway? When this is the basic level of trust between the author and his audience, how can you expect me to follow <i>any</i> rule without understanding its purpose? The culture of rpg writing has ruined any chance for taking texts at face value.<br/><br/>Therefore, when writing full-blown rpg prose, I strive to make my intentions clear. If that means commenting on my own rules, so be it. Elliot's example is actually pretty good - how the heck should I know when I should spend a stone to increase another's chance of success, if I don't understand the purpose of the game itself and of this rule? Why should I engage in boardgamey nitpicking of "can" vs. "may" when I don't for a second believe that the author operated on that level? On the other hand, if I understand the purpose, then the rule itself is also obvious. In some games the intent is so simple and obvious that it doesn't have to harped upon through the book, but often rpgs are complex beasts and it doesn't hurt to reinforce and contextualize the material several times through the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183816/#Comment_183816" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T18:49:48+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  6:49PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll respectfully disagree with Eero. An RPG has rules the same as a boardgame. You can pick and choose rules in a boardgame just as easily as you can in an RPG. Both of them will suffer or improve, depending on the rules eliminated and the preferences of the group. Either way, as soon as you do so, you are not playing the game the creator wrote. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the rules are clear and have been fully tested, if you follow them, certain things will happen. In the end, your group will have fun or not with those rules. The designer shouldn't compromise the fact that they are rules simply because of this unalterable fact. I mean, you may as well put Rule Zero back into the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I agree with the meat of your post, but not this basic point. Intent is important so that the players can analyze the rule and what it's supposed to do, so that they'll be better able to decide if that's the fun they want to have. It will also better allow them to understand the rule, if there is any ambiguity in its phrasing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Alex overall.

Get different readers to provide input and ideas.<br/><br/>I'm still brainstorming on ways to improve how game texts are written, and here's a spot I think could generally be improved. It's in two parts:<br/><br/>* <b>How does the mechanic look inside the fiction</b>? Sometimes I'll see a mechanic or procedure and -- usually because the intent behind that rule is opaque -- I'll have no idea how to represent it in the game fiction. One example would be folding in Dust Devils. Character stats and other metrics in the game can also be a little confusing to me: What does a high/low value look like in the fiction? That's a place where I think example text would be lovely, with the clarification that these are just ideas and not a hard-coded list.<br/><br/>* <b>Does the mechanic drive the fiction, or does the fiction restrict the mechanic</b>? Different games do it different ways, sometimes both within the same game, and I think it's very easy to be myopic about that. <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183915/#Comment_183915" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T09:12:02+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  9:12AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That statement you're quoting is not against making mechanics evocative, he's just saying mere evocativeness is not enough, and clarity trumps it every time.

Which is, of course, an imperfect blend of evocativeness and clarity. If you can be evocative while being clear and instructional, I doubt Paul would object.

The book is a piece of instructional reference. Commentary hinders reference.<br/><br/>-L</blockquote>\nThis is generally my position on the matter.<br/><br/>I'll stake a claim to having a fairly extensive knowledge of Forge theory, which I continue to augment and supplement by reading a variety of game design sources (e.g. the <i>Rules and Play</i> textbook, <i>Second Person</i>, and my recent discovery <a href="gameplaywright.net" rel="nofollow">Gameplaywright</a>.) And it is my ongoing deep desire to let none of these discussions into the text of my games.<br/><br/>For example, <i>Dirty Secrets</i> play makes extensive use of Lines and Veils. Lines about issues with children are actually hardcoded into the game system, while general Lines and Veils can be addressed through judicious use of Jurisdiction and Appeal. But I never use the term "Lines and Veils" in the text. Nor should I. Those are terms of art that we use to discuss game play and design. Players of my games shouldn't have to learn terms of art or jargon; they should simply be able to play.<br/><br/>Now, I will say that I distinguish between answering "why?" and answering "how?". I include a sizeable section in <i>Dirty Secrets</i> explaining how to best use the rules to create an enjoyable story. The entire manuscript of <i>A Flower for Mara</i> is one long procedural document, explaining the "how?" step by step. But that's about teaching <i>play</i>, not discussing <i>design</i>. In general, my design rationale never appears in the text of my games.<br/><br/>I will note that this was commented upon favorably in <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13415.phtml" rel="nofollow">one review of <i>Dirty Secrets</i> on RPG.net</a>:\n<blockquote><br/>One thing I\u2019d like to stress out about the prose is how much it stands on its own. I haven\u2019t read that many \u201cindie\u201d games, but something I noticed in some of the ones I did read is that <b>they seemed to require prior knowledge of Forge theory in order to get the most out of them</b>. Not being a Forge luminary in the least, I was somewhat bummed by this. <b>When I buy a game, I expect it to stand on its own, not require me to read essays and basically buy into a very specific view of roleplaying games in order to understand how they were designed or how to play them</b>. Thankfully, this is not the case here. You can buy Dirty Secrets and understand exactly how it works and what it does without having ever heard of Forge theory.<br/></blockquote>\nEmphasis mine.<br/><br/>So apparently I'm not alone in my opinions on this matter.<br/><br/>Plus, of course, Luke. ;-)<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184303/#Comment_184303" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T15:02:48+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  3:02PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a huge difference between explaining:<br/><br/>* What rules are for, and how to use them best<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>* Why rules are designed the way they are<br/><br/>Are some people conflating them into one thing?<br/><br/>I actually like to see the second part, because I like to tinker with stuff, and often a rule that seems weird at first turns out to have a good rationale that wasn't immediately apparent.<br/><br/>But I don't think I'm representative of most people in that sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184307/#Comment_184307" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T15:11:36+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  3:11PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Paul.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>There is a huge difference between explaining:<br/><br/>* What rules are for, and how to use them best<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>* Why rules are designed the way they are</blockquote>\nThat's a good division.

However, I wanted to comment that after reading all these terrific responses I find myself reading the material with a new eye. This is assisted by the fact that we are into serious playtesting now and are trying to find the rules in the text for ourselves, which is giving me new perspective.<br/><br/>And so thank you! At the moment I'm going through the core text and bolding everything that looks like a RULE so I can find it more easily when we play. That seems like something that, if it works for me. will probably work for others. It will force some re-wording so the extracted text doesn't break up the flow of the surrounding context, but even if it's not a final solution, it's a clear step on the path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_187527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187527/#Comment_187527" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T04:29:23+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  4:29AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>There is a huge difference between explaining:<br/><br/>* What rules are for, and how to use them best<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>* Why rules are designed the way they are<br/><br/>Are some people conflating them into one thing?</blockquote>\nI almost always find it easier and more useful to explain HOW a game is played verses WHY the game is designed the way it is. For example, explaining how to play Chess is easy, but explaining why it's designed that way is a lot less useful, and such will be better explained through play experience anyway.<br/><br/>That is, as long as the rules regarding how to play are clear enough .<br/><br/>The thing that really drives me nutzoid though are questions like 'Why would I want to play?', or 'What is your game about?'. Such questions imply that game play is not a valid end in itself, and the possible answers are usually too undefined to be very useful. Why would you want to play Chess? Because it's something to socialize over coffee with? Because it provides an intellectual challenge? Because the pieces are cooler looking than the ones for Go?<br/><br/>You shouldn't have to justify the things you enjoy, and trying to do so tends to create a lot of cognitive dissonance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187532/#Comment_187532" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T06:37:33+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  6:37AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I shall second Paul B's loathing of rules that are blended with 'colour text'.  Exhibit A is, of course, Nobilis. A book that blends rules with suggestions, colour text and game fiction resulting in something that is less a functioning rulebook and more one of those diaries from Se7en only with whimsy replacing psychosis.<br/><br/>What I want from a rule text is brevity and simplicity.<br/><br/>You can't be succinct and simple if you insist upon standing over my shoulder and explaining what you were trying to achieve with a particular rule.  It strikes me as an impulse that is at best a reflection of deep insecurity (surely the rules speak for themselves?) or, less charitably, supreme self-indulgence whereby you force players to route march through not only your rules but also your tiresome attempts to demonstrate how awesome you are by picking Juuuuust the right rule for juuuuust the right situation.<br/><br/>My view of all texts, whether of rules or not, is that once the text is published, the author no longer has any power over his work.  People will make of it what they will.  If your rules are clear and your concept is interesting then people will play the game the way you intended.  Otherwise they will have fun with it in their own way.<br/><br/>I'd put rule justification up there with glossy artwork and game fiction as examples of needless stuff that exists solely to bloat the text of rulebooks and pander to the people who buy but never play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187660/#Comment_187660" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T21:28:58+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  9:28PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...the only thing wrong I see with all this "explanation is great!" stuff is that most of the time I find authors are so severely wrong about their games that it's almost not worth listening to them except for the shock value.

That is, though they are certainly rules, frequently they are rules that, even when their authors don't intend it, benefit from flexibility in application and even vagueness. User interpretation may make them better games by providing space in which the players dabble in game design -- an admission that game design might be a part of the hobby rather than external to it. If that's the case then perfectly executed technical manuals may fail to deliver game precisely because they admit no confusion, as their perfection is a result of misapprehending the nature of their topic.<br/><br/>Now, I tinker with everything, so obviously this is me imagining everyone is exactly like me. But most RPG players I interact with do this and do it at a semi-conscious level where rigid uninterpretable rules would be a barrier to tinker (by denying permission, which a vague ruleset grants or even demands). If I want to get that "permission to tinker" explicitly in the rules (and I do), isn't calibrating my document as a technical manual a miss-step?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188142/#Comment_188142" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T14:58:42+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  2:58PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i think knowing the whys behind rules can be <i>very</i> useful, but only in particular circumstances.  i don't need or want to know the whys behind everything in a text.<br/><br/>however, some games have pretty intricate or complex mechanics.  sometimes i see a rule and i think "I have no idea why I'm supposed to do this.

In the course of explaining that, I think it'll be more than a strong implication that, yeah, tinkering is okay.<br/><br/>Weird example that pops into my head: When we were working our way through 3:16, I was following lots of threads about the game -- sort of looking for a mix of inspiration and procedural clarifications. John Harper, maybe, posted an AP thread in which he talked about the consequence of a failed NFA roll meant that the character lost his armor, or that he gave his combat drugs to another character. Something like that. And I was taken aback! Nowhere in the text did it say what you <i>could</i> do with an NFA roll other than grant a +1 to a future FA roll. There was an explicit "this is what happens" instruction in the text. It wasn't worded in a more inviting way, something like "The GM can impose a small but mechanically significant modifier to a future roll or change the status of a character, for example granting a +1 to a future FA roll, or spending a character's armor or combat drug for this planet." <br/><br/>So...was that a shortcoming of the rules text that the scope of NFA results wasn't discussed? Or was it assumed that players wouldn't bother following the RAW anyway, so why bother cluttering up the text with the discussion? Kind of weird. The vibe I got from the game text was very much RTFM; it doesn't read like a toolbox game to me. <br/><br/>Anyway, that's a good recent example of a disconnect between the RAW and the intended use of the rules. I say "intended" only because I believe Gregor gave the thumbs-up to that AP at some point. (Please don't ask me for links! This is from memory but I think I'm right about it.)<br/><br/>There's probably a bridgeable gap between "anything not allowed is prohibited" and "anything not prohibited is allowed" in any game text.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188151/#Comment_188151" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T15:50:02+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  3:50PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>i think knowing the whys behind rules can be <i>very</i> useful, but only in particular circumstances.  i don't need or want to know the whys behind everything in a text.<br/><br/>however, some games have pretty intricate or complex mechanics. sometimes i see a rule and i think "I have no idea why I'm supposed to do this.

Good explanations could possibly "rescue" rules from being tinkered with by me.  I mean, it's possible.<br/><br/>The thing is, I don't know that it's actually worth any author's time to bother with it.  What the fuck do they care if I'm playing the game according to their rules?  Their income isn't dependent on me using their rules as they were written -- just on me buying their book, which I obviously already did.  They aren't at the same table I am.  I am never going to run a game for them, or play in a game they are running.  The only way they'll even know that I'm ignoring their carefully-thought-out rules and replacing them with my own carefully-thought-out tinkering is if I post about it on the internet, and good lord, who the hell cares about anything anyone says on the internet?<br/><br/>So unless they have a pathological need to have their rules obeyed by everyone, even random dudes they will never meet and whose game sessions they will likely never hear about, then I don't see any need for them to add explanations.  They can do it if they want to, of course -- I will happily accept behind-the-music style sidebars telling me what the hell they were thinking when they wrote this and why they thought it was a good idea -- but that's something they ought to do for their own satisfaction, not because there's any obligation on their part to provide it to me.<br/><br/>(On the other hand, I suspect that there ARE in fact authors who feel that pathological need to know that their work is going unmolested by random dudes they will never meet, in which case there isn't much I feel inclined to do to help them.  If they stress out over writing explanations that will convince me to do what <i>they</i> want with their game instead of what <i>I</i> want to do with it, well, so be it.

(Although maybe there's a grey area:  Rodriguez's commentary on "Desperado" gives a lot of interesting and insightful information about making a movie on a tight budget, which works even though the actual movie he made on that budget isn't very good at all.  I could imagine enjoying reading a rulebook that was full of fascinating explanations and finding it useful, even if the actual game was so completely what I hated that I would never even dream of

In the baseball thing, it's not that the (wholly fictional, I'm sure) players were having trouble understanding the rules and procedures, but that they didn't understand the reason behind them so they dropped or changed rules in an attempt to "improve" the game that just ended up ruining it.<br/>I've seen this in RPGs and sometimes in board or war games.  Rules that I understand how to apply, but <i>seem</i>, at first glance, to be unnecessary or even harmful to the game.  sometimes this is because I don't have enough experience with the game as a whole to see how everything ties together, or to see how the economies are supposed to flow.<br/><br/>These cases are thankfully fairly rare (at least for me, personally).  I certainly don't want a side bar that gives the author's behind-the-scenes thoughts and explanations about <i>every single rule</i>.  But sometimes - sometimes - a note saying "I know this rule may seem odd at first, but it's important because of x, y, and z" might be nice, especially if beta testers have demonstrated a tendency to see that rule and say "Well!  We <i>clearly</i> don't need <i>this</i>!" and toss it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_188364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188364/#Comment_188364" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T16:52:10+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  4:52PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>What the fuck do they care if I'm playing the game according to their rules?</blockquote>\nBecause consistent rules support a larger community, and in this market that's critical.

Something I believe happens in FLGS-centric gaming communities but I have never personally encountered.  Even when I gamed in a club, you selected for the people you played with, not the game you were playing.<br/><br/>Secondly, that's assuming that the game, as written, is interesting.

My interest in a larger gaming community is...well, not really an interest, when it comes down to it.<br/><br/>But hey, at least this gives me more evidence for my "no one who wants to turn a profit publishing games should care what I do" theory.  Not only can you never make any significant money catering to my tastes in games, but I'm not even part of any kind of larger community that could help your sales indirectly.  I'm great if you want to reach the three to five friends I play with, but beyond that, nothing.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_188870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188870/#Comment_188870" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T06:44:11+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  6:44AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>So on the whole, I think it's still none of the author's business what I do with their games.</blockquote>\nEh, I guess I can see what you're saying.
