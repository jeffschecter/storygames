I didn't know what any of this meant: I just threw it in.<br/><br/>I forget what the secret of Blue City was. It sort of emerged from play. At the end, they realised that the only way to save Blue City was to become part of Blue City. I remember Simon's character morphed into an NPC, Mr Phylactery, who we'd introduced earlier. And everyone else went off to become newsagents and things.<br/><br/>So, yes, the secret of Blue City emerged from player's ideas, which I built on.<br/><br/>The campaign itself was lots of individual missions, but there were running storylines between them: Miner, the Lacuna, etc.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267995/#Comment_267995" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T19:58:30+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  7:58PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contrary to the respected Mr. Gillan, I did successfully run Lacuna as a campaign with only one player.<br/><br/>I think you need to have some nascent ideas or images about WHAT THE LACUNA IS DOING.

I read through the book, which for me was just full of all these crazy awesome ideas and little tidbits that just begged to be expanded upon. So I used that as my jumping off point. Then I would go onto wikipedia and hit random article a bunch of time, writing down the parts that struck me as interesting or creepy. So if I got a name, I'd look at the page for a few things about that person, and write them down as a potential personality or hostile personality for use during the game. If it was like a locations I might try and incorporate that, and if it was something like a breed of fly, I might make that something strange the characters encounter as the static rises, etc. <br/><br/>In addition to that, I'd type up some weird hand-outs to have the players find during their mission. Things like scrawled diary entries, heavily redacted messages from control to another team of agents found somewhere suspicious in Blue City, that type of thing. I wouldn't have a specific place for these documents to be, but I'd always manage to get them in somewhere. They proved to be pretty popular, so much so that saying something is [CLASSIFIED] is a hilarious inside joke to my players even a year later. Other than that, I wouldn't do much other prep. It would be sort of a free-form GM experience for me. I think that the fact that I was almost as enthralled by the mystery of everything as the players helped keep things going for a long period of time. <br/><br/>During play, I would let static control most of the game's pacing. Since whenever static increases something happens in the game, things would go along at a good pace, and leap into weirdness at an excellent pace. Combined with heart-rates, this allowed for things to still have a nice pacing to them, but also made it so that every decision had to be important, which is really the brilliance of the system. One thing I did was make one of the static increasing conditions "players get distracted or talk about stuff out of character a lot". Now, my players enjoy socializing, and this led to a lot of static being built up, which was fine for me. It also made it so whenever the game got side tracked, when it got back online there would be something going on. I also picked the player who I knew got along the worst with the others as team leader so that the others would disobey orders more often, increasing the static even farther. <br/><br/>I had a great soundtrack which I think added a lot. I used 'Everyone Alive Wants Answers" by <a href="http://www.colleenplays.org/" rel="nofollow">Colleen</a> as the game's main theme (highly recommended for creepy background music, by the way. I also had various other tracks, such as stuff off Nine Inch Nails "The Slip", and Muse "Origin of Symmetry". The Spidermen had their own theme <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/129300" rel="nofollow">"Mind of a Child"</a> by Zenon (free download off newgrounds). <br/><br/>Story-wise, I would come up with things, and then add more to what the players followed up on. There were definite bigger mysteries to the thing that took many sessions to explain ("What is Wine Level?" "What are Black Agents?" "What are the Spidermen?" "Who is the Girl?" 'Who is Agent Miner?" "What's the deal with the Company?", etc.) but at the same time there were also a ton of strange events that never got explained. I would throw in things like representing commendations by poker chips and having colors besides the standard blue that I never explained: the players figured out on their own what white commendations, black commendations, and others did, and in fact their theorizing affected the eventual truth, since even I didn't know in full when I started handing them out. <br/><br/>So in the short run, the game was about the players finding and taking down the hostile personalities, while finding out as much as they could, but as the game progressed a lot less mission got done and a lot more crazy stuff happened. I added some stuff, like more skill trees for when the players reached deep blue and black clearances (although that was mostly because my players like skills and stuff, coming from a D&amp;D background). One mission, one half of the team went and did the mission, which involved chasing down a hostile personality in a massive spider-infested library, while the other half of the team sat in an empty bar and drank the entire mission, hoping that weirdness would come to them...and that it did.<br/><br/>In the end of the campaign (after about six eight-hour two-mission sessions), after going through two sets of characters, the players had learned most of the secrets they had sought (although a few lingering questions remained), and everyone met their destinies- Blue City was flooded, one of the players replaced the girl as the new anchor to the lacuna, and the other left to run the now in-ruins company, only to find that back in the real world all trace of its existence had been wiped away. I could go into way more details about the events of the campaign, but honestly I think a big part of the fun of running Lacuna is not knowing the answers. <br/><br/>Anyways, if you have any more questions I'd be glad to answer. I could talk about this for quite a while, it was the most popular and fun campaign I've ever ran, and I still have all my notes and handouts in a manila envelope marked [CLASSIFIED] next to my desk, just in case...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
