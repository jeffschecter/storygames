It was a huge game and a ton of fun.  We had seven players and four of them were new to TTwR so we had a few teachable moments as well.  With seven players that means four dominoes each so ALL the dominoes were in play and the special rules in Iron Angel meant that we had seven demon attacks to deal with.<br/><br/>Everyone got in the act and we even had a few people excited enough that they wanted to create their own play sets in the future.<br/><br/>You can find the free rules for The Trouble with Rose and the Iron Angel Sakura play set here:<br/><a href="http://www.tangent-zero.com/trouble.htm" rel="nofollow">http://tangent-zero.com/trouble.htm</a><br/>--<br/>TAZ                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
