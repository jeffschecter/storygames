Hey, look at that, so do I! I usually keep it folded up and off to the side, and when I need to quick-reference something I pull it out, unfold it to the correct section, reference the rule, then fold it back up and put it down again.<br/><br/>I like the idea of a rules reference... object. Something more than a loose collection of notes (or rules downloads) on paper scattered around.<br/><br/>IIRC, the folks who make Savage Worlds make this "do it yourself" awesome GM screen with three panels, where you make up your own rules references and slip them inside to make your own GM screen. I like that idea, but again I imagine that I'd use it as basically an analog Tablet PC, unfolding it when needed, folding it back up when I'm done (so the price point of $30-something couldn't justify itself to me).<br/><br/>Back in the days of 2e Dark Sun, they experimented with these table-tent-looking spiral-bound rules references/pictures things for their published adventures. I kinda dug them for what they were, and think that format might be interesting for a rules reference.<br/><br/>So, what would be a creative DIY way to make a cool, useful rules reference object that isn't:<br/>- 3 panel GM screen<br/>- a laptop/kindle<br/>- a collection of paper notes in a pile or scattered about<br/><br/>Thoughts? Think crafts-y, people. Scissors and tape and sparkles. Bonus points for pictures.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239794/#Comment_239794" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T11:04:15+00:00" title="October 30, 2009 11:04AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lay out canvas "board"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239795/#Comment_239795" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T11:09:29+00:00" title="October 30, 2009 11:09AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course the best option in my book is to have the rules be so easy to remember and use that the players never have to look at them after the first game but since that isn't likely I like putting them on the game map. I can do this because I make board games but any Abstract game "board" can be laid out so that everyone can see the rules. I want everyone to have equal access to the rules because I like equality, which I can do because Engle Matrix Games have the referee role shift around from player to player so no one is strictly speaking in control. <br/><br/>From a manufacturing arts and crafts angle a stand up GM screen is produceable with a regular printer, paste, chip board, and some varnish (I like shellac for these purposes). Once you start playing around with hinges there are a lot of interesting shapes you can come up with. It's like those test they give in High School where you have to imagine how the patterns fold up. I was alwayre real good at those.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239797/#Comment_239797" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T11:15:42+00:00" title="October 30, 2009 11:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got nothing on the DIY angle, but all the rules for <a href="http://www.dig1000holes.wordpress.com/time-temp/" rel="nofollow">Time &amp; Temp: Unbound Edition</a> are presented as 5 double-sided 8 1/2 x 11 cardstock pages and only on those pages to encourage learning the rules in play.

Basically, it is partly a rules reference, but mostly an idea board of both imagery and setting info, possibly with character info ( if pregens are involved) and playstyle info ( probably stolen from Play Unsafe) and various forms of Yes Ands from Archipelago/Itras By cards. With some white space for writing in stuff, drawing arows, recording, etc.<br/><br/>In concept, it is supposed to be chaotic and random, so that players make their own connections as game patterns begin to emerge during play.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it is meant for games with extremely simple mechanisms, but where high amounts of player generated content are expeceted. The collage is meant to be creative -soup starter and a touchstone for players when their creativity flags a bit. It's also meant to allow a situation designer to put some overall general focus in, but without completely bounding where creativity goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239817/#Comment_239817" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T12:14:01+00:00" title="October 30, 2009 12:14PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2009 12:20PM by johnzo.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Take your GM screen panels with their tiny print and make them poster-sized.  Back in the day, I did this for the Car Wars phased movement chart and it really sped things along.  I used sticky notes to note the players' current speeds.  I could see this being handy for 4E condition and action reference.  Maybe throw an initiative tracker up there as well...<br/><br/>2) It's not super-DIY, but I also want to throw some love at D&amp;D4E, for providing crunchy bits that almost always will print on a 4x6 index card.  Brilliantly, they also provide tools to format your DIY crunch onto those 4x6 cards.  On one hand, 4x6 cards are just a loose collection of notes.  On the other hand, they're also playing pieces and state trackers.  I use my monster cards for initiative tracking and rule reference and I believe the players use their power cards to track their daily and encounter usage.<br/><br/>3) Tri-purpose state tracking / rules reference / playing pieces seem like a good idea.  I've seen / heard of 4E condition tentcards that you can throw in front of a player, and they have the rules for the condition printed directly on the card for everyone's reference.  Haven't built anything like this for our game, though I do use tented cards to display monster defense scores.  The players love to take these away from me when they dispatch a beastie.<br/><br/>Could Danger Patrol benefit from dropping some rules on its state trackers?  Maybe the threat-ignoring rules could go on every threat card, and the countdown rules could go on the countdown threat cards...<br/><br/>( edited to aside: state / reference / playing piece multiplexing is the thing that's got me excited about the touchable game table things that have been going around.  Replacing a big sheaf of cards and papers and a plastic mini with a single virtual fig that's loaded with useful contextual menus seems like it could be victory for 4E. )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239820/#Comment_239820" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T12:27:30+00:00" title="October 30, 2009 12:27PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Justin, RPG on the Surface wouldn't NEED a reference, if the figures or objects on it also had some way of being detected. Push down on my figure, see a rosette of options, pick one, see options related to that, drill down to what I want to do; at that point, I push down on the target and BAM, all modifiers are calculated for range and terrain, the hit dice are rolled, the damage is noted, character sheets are updated. Augmented reality miniature games are going to get to this point LONG before a Surface is cheaper than some special glasses. but we're talking DIY, here, ya? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> )<br/><br/>Hmm... in no particular order:<br/><br/>* Tracking Tool as Reference - I've made a Range Chart board for Burning Wheel Fight! which shows the Ob penalties for differing ranges and who's in range to attack whom. I can imagine a variety of "boards" that not only track a state or resource but also show the mechanical effects of that state or of those remaining resources. Lots of character sheets actually do this in one way or another (BW, again, WRT tracking wounds and wound penalties). I can imagine a character sheet which summarizes EVERYTHING for a particular character, based on what's chosen (e.g. every spell lists it casting time, duration, range, etc, right on the sheet; and you just bubble beside which spells you have)... but it couldn't be a game with the level of detail of D&amp;D, unless you want character sheets that are customized per class (or sub-class!) and well over four pages.<br/><br/>* Scripting Sheets - Speaking of BW, the Duel of Wits and Fight scripting sheets are some of the best tools for reference while gaming I've seen yet. Laminate them and you'll soon agree; it rocks to not only have EVERYTHING you can choose to do as a bubble to fill in, but almost every resultant modifier and (on the back side) the cross-reference charts for what happens when FOO opposes BAR. Brilliant.<br/><br/>* State Cards - If a particular state or condition results in a lot of rules tweaks or crunch, just have that on a card which can be placed before the affected character's player, for reference. This is basically a "per-person, per-circumstance" instance of cheat sheets; and it's probably best for games with a lot of subsystems for special situations. D&amp;D Feat cards are a similar idea, but they aren't state-based (i.e. they are a minor variation on "a collection of paper notes in a pile").<br/><br/>* Embedded Mechanics (Orthogonal) - I'm thinking now of a game whose play aides embed the actual mechanics--consider Descent. Yes, you got your "Stuff Cards," but one of the cool aspects of the dice system is that each item or spell or what-not uses a particular set of dice (one or more of green, yellow, blue, red, black dice). The dice themselves have different efficacy for different purposes, though for "combat" rolls, some dice are clearly superior than other, in that they lack chances for outright failure or produce more surges or damage. Obviously, this is a bit orthogonal, as most games don't support customizing dice, or they use the different polyhedrals to handle such scaling; and so it's not really DIY unless you've got a great head for stats (to rework the game system to support dice-as-reference).<br/><br/>* WYSIWYG (Orthogonal) - I'm thinking now of Mechaton, in particular how specific attachments (tend to) require specific colors, to help folks (a) tell what mech can do what and (b) recall what kind of die to roll to move or attack (green or red d8, respectively, if double-attachment, in a nutshell). So what you have, then, is a way to immediately reference capabilities without looking at a "character sheet" or memorizing that "more than two legs rolls d8 to move (though, yeah, that's almost intuitive). On a related note, this is what I think was Clix's Killer App: the dial. No more looking up "fatigue" or "beat down' stats on a table for each unit type: it's right there on the dial, as you click it down. Brilliant.<br/><br/>...and I'm spent for the moment. I suppose I can't abstract this challenge very well--I tend to play a game, figure out what I'm referencing or confusing a lot, then make a custom solution for the problem, be it my Range Chart board or a customized cheat sheet (I've made a fur-sided one for HERO that basically keeps me from ever looking in the book after character creation, believe it or not).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239823/#Comment_239823" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T12:39:58+00:00" title="October 30, 2009 12:39PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh, two brilliant extant rules reference examples from the Mouse:<br/><br/>1) The Mouse Guard character sheet contains enough of the rules to play the game.
