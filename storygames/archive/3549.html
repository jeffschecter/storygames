Some explicit things in the game world description only get a blurry representation here (i.e., the moon silver is one of the reasons for the low sovereignty value of Khale. IMHO, all of these guys could do something for their citizens so they'd feel a bit more welcome or at home.

Rules-wise, they just cancel out, but it makes for good characterization."</blockquote>\nWell geez, man. Talk about mixed signals! If it makes for good characterization *and* it's desirable, why not make that characterization mechanically advantageous?  It's Spider-Man being forced to choose save Mary-Jane or the bus of New Yorkers. He can't do both, so he's forced to choose and live with the consequences. Sucks for him. Awesome for us.<br><br>I suggested a bonus die when your action follows one passion, but directly contradicts another. You get *two* bonus dice when your action follows one, but directly contradicts the other two. (I thought about three bonus dice when you contradict all three passions, but <i>that's</i> equally as uninteresting as following all your passions.)<br><br>The downside: If your action follows two passions, but doesn't contradict the third, you lose a die. If your action follows all three of your passions, you lose two dice.<br><br>I couldn't figure out how to get three bonus dice or lose three dice, but maybe you can. The point is encouraging internal conflict though.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
