Some people are afraid of introducing radical ideas in front of a group and don\u2019t speak up; in other cases, the group is either too small or too big to be effective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But according to a recently published study, the real problem may be that participants\u2019 get stuck on each others\u2019 ideas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Kohn and Smith believed the cause might be due to \u201ccognitive fixation,\u201d or the concept that, when exposed to group members\u2019 ideas, people focused on those and blocked other types of ideas from taking hold. They experimented with this by manipulating the number of ideas participants saw in their chat windows, with some getting a few cues and others getting more. Their hypothesis was right: When exposed to many cues, the undergrads offered up less creative, diverse ideas. The numbers improved when the students were given a five-minute break during the exercise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>As with all such studies, there\u2019s plenty of pretty obvious common sense to this research. But it\u2019s a helpful reminder of how unhelpful it can be when managers dump people in a room together, thinking it will result in creative big ideas. Somehow, a belief in the power of group brainstorming sessions persists, despite evidence that it doesn\u2019t work.</blockquote>\nPossibly relevant to RPGs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347624/#Comment_347624" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T07:49:21+00:00" title="November  2, 2011  7:49AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely relevant to RPGs!

When they get there, everyone can pool their lists and go over it.  On the other hand, if people show up and then you start asking people how they want the game to go, then you probably will see some groupthink and/or subsequent people spending more time riffing off previous people's ideas rather than introducing their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347632/#Comment_347632" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T08:59:36+00:00" title="November  2, 2011  8:59AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are lots of <a href="http://personalexcellence.co/blog/25-brainstorming-techniques" rel="nofollow">different techniques</a> for <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/brainstm.html" rel="nofollow">brainstorming</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming#Sources_of_brainstorming_inadequacy" rel="nofollow">recognise some of the problems</a> and attempt to get round them.

Bad in that it can lead to less creative input. I've seen RPGs with lots of rules and concepts literally leave less 'room for imagination' during play. It's the difference between a character being able to poison someone by drilling through the floor and using a string to drip poison into a cup below and ONLY being able to poison someone if a character has the Use Poison skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347920/#Comment_347920" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T01:56:25+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  1:56AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, people generate more diverse ideas on their own than in a group. That is indeed relevant to roleplaying, even if it turns out we don't often do brainstorming per se.<br/><br/>Question: To what extent are diverse ideas helpful? At what point in a game are they helpful? Is it sometimes better to have less diversity?<br/><br/>My answer would be that the typical rpg needs structured diversity. The various players around the table need to be on the same page. So in the type of situation where a "brainstorm" might be useful (generally around the point the game is set up), at the very least I'd say you want someone (the GM or the host or whoever) to give the group a remit for their brainstorm - limits within which to work. Then perhaps you could send everyone off to generate ideas on their own.<br/><br/>Then again, isn't the reality that roleplayers, when doing the type of game that requires brainstorm-esque activity, are doing it precisely because they enjoy creating things as a group? Maybe it's worth sacrificing a bit of diversity of ideas for that.<br/><br/>One more thing: This experiment simply shows that when you put people in a discussion with strangers there's inhibition of idea generation. The same effect might well not apply in a room where everyone trusts each other and where there's a lot of support for genuinely diverse creativity (my experience is that this is not the case in other environments where one is brainstorming, despite the fact that this is ostensibly what the brainstorm is meant to foster). So is this more relevant to con games, where people don't know each other and there's danger of social inhibition taking over? (And if so, is that a bad thing? Maybe you don't want your most wild and creative play to happen in a brand new group?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348174/#Comment_348174" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-07T03:05:26+00:00" title="November  7, 2011  3:05AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Firstly, nice! Washington Post picked up on <a href="http://bps-occupational-digest.blogspot.com/2011/10/stuck-on-your-ideas-fixation-in-group.html" rel="nofollow">my report</a> again - must be the third one this year.<br/><br/>Secondly, it's a shame that it missed one of the nuances of the original academic article, that I tried to cover in my report - that the brainstorming groups went deeper into the categories that they did explore; where they suffered was in breadth of categories.<br/><br/>I think this corresponds quite nicely to rpgs. As people are already discussing, we aren't necessarily interested in copious volumes of disparate ideas when eg worldbuilding. Rather, we want to get on the same page and generate some interesting possibilities from there. <br/><br/>So given "Period:1930s", we can generate ideas alone and then come together: this is more likely to end up with ideas that include everything but the kitchen sink. Or, we meet fresh and generate ideas together, in which case we are more likely to hone in on certain themes or situations, and riff off of these, even without a firm hand (eg The Producer) encouarging this,  simply because we are primed by the other early ideas to fixate on key areas.<br/><br/>The risk is that those key areas end up being the obvious ones - as film noir often springs to mind first, we end up with the third noir game in as many months. But all that's needed to prevent that is some early ideas or framing that take us away from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348191/#Comment_348191" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-07T07:57:17+00:00" title="November  7, 2011  7:57AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool Alex!

We get a series of things that are cool but may or may not go together. From there, I have the first player pick two elements (which are not their own) from the list that look they would go well together. If the group supports the pairing, it becomes "official".<br/><br/>So I might look at our list of "1930's" elements, and pick out two that jump out at me, "recently unemployed banker" and "alien invasion". That narrows down our field immediately, and in a very interesting way: it suggests "average Joe" involved in some kind of weird story outside his control, maybe some "body snatchers", etc.<br/><br/>There are lots of ways to approach this kind of constrained creative process, and I find them really interesting to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
