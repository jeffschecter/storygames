There was some frustration involved with getting started, but it mostly stemmed from the timing of the players' arrival. Started out with three players, and just when we'd gotten everything done but their bonds (I asked lots of leading questions to each player, and made sure everyone else gave their full attention during this part of the process, and I found that it gave us a really good feel for who the characters were, as well as a good description of each of them). At this point, the fourth player showed up. We got him all set, then did Bonds. Just then, a fifth player arrives. We of course oblige her (she's the host's daughter, and loves to game with us), and so finally we finish up by her just selecting bonds (we decide that no one else needs to re-write their bonds to include her) and the stats get highlighted. The characters are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nHugh the Human Fighter, a former pit fighter owned by a minor noble. Escaped from that life when an earthquake destroyed the walls of the colosseum's holding area. A 19 year old ball of muscles, he wears plate armor that is a hodgepodge pieced together from the various armors of his fallen foes, and wields an ancient sword whose serrated edge carries vicious barbs, as well as a shield made of dragonscales (because why not).<br/>\n<br/>\nHaruspex, the Elf Wizard, is a wisp-thin creature of mystery and a dark past. His player decided that instead of using books, he learned magic by killing a tribal shaman and stealing his magical strings of rune-carved bones. He now wears those few strings he has learned the spells from hanging off his belt. He does carry a bag of books, though, but that's just because he likes to read. His crazy (mismatched) eyes and wild (blue) hair suggest that he may have been experimenting on himself, as well as (as we later found out when people read off their Bonds) on Hugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nE-Rock the Elven Ranger immediately decided he wanted scale armor made from leviathan scales, so in order to explain that, he came up with the story that his father was a legendary monster hunter who had slain a juvenile spawn of Leviathan. This motif continued, as his Hunter's Bow was made from the tailbone of another monster (whose name I don't recall at the moment) and strung with a steel cable. We decided later that leviathans are forest green in color, since he chose camouflage for his look. His little brother, Jephistopheles, had also been apprenticed to their father, but had copped a 'tude and run off to do his own thing. Jephistopheles was jealous of E-Rock's greater skill, but E-rock had earned it by sticking with his apprenticeship.<br/>\n<br/>\nMartek the Human Rogue is way stronger than his knobby body would indicate. He favors dual wielding a short sword and a dagger, and he and E-Rock have a long running con together. The ranger will lead city folks out through 'secret route' to a nearby city, which leads through the woods, where Martek will ambush the group, knocking out the mark, and they both rob him blind, splitting the profits. He is a sharp-eyed fellow, and it was he who initially got the group into this mess with exploring the Goblin Hole. He asked his friend E-rock, who told Heruspex to come along, and Hugh came along as a matter of course, since has sworn to guard the life of Haruspex, and Martek and E-Rock hired the paladin as a healer and bodyguard.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharity the Human Paladin showed up JUST as we had gotten the backstory elements reasonably coherently woven together (insofar as Martek's home turf is the city which had suffered the earthquake which had allowed Hugh to escape his life of slavery, and Haruspex's shaman victim was E-Rock's maternal grandfather, but E-Rock was willing to let him prove himself worthy of not being executed for this crime by accompanying him on the trip to The Goblin Hole and helping him with Martek's mission (this bit was all collaborative)).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we got her all set up with stats, moves, a warhorse called Aurora (who didn't really end up amounting to much thus far, see below), and a well-armed knightly order focused on, of all things, Charity. Her goddess, she decided, was called Farore, like the great fairy from LoZ: OoT, and Charity carried a worn wooden holy symbol (it was an heirloom).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I asked a couple of questions and they wandered in. I asked Charity how long she thinks the ponies would be safe and she immediately said that Aurora would guard them, which was cool enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Discerning Realities, Haruspex found a small pile of rabbit bones, which he immediately scooped up and put into one of his sacks/pouches. Oh, and he also found a few drops of blood and signs of a scuffle leading North. However, they ended up going Northeast, which led to a chamber with a bunch of hutches occupied by blind, hairless rabbits. E-Rock decided to set them free and gained an XP, but he didn't balk when Haruspex decided to keep one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoving on, they entered a room (via a hole barely large enough fo a man to squeeze through) that was thick with sweet smoke, which ended up being a spit of five abilno carp roasting over a coal fire (which was also burning dung, the source of the smoke). Haruspex was hungry, and so he tried snatching a fish, but a goblin was on top of him in seconds. Fortunately, Hugh clotheslined it with his wicked blade (killing it in one shot easily) but not before it got the chance to scream. This had half a dozen more goblins coming at them, though an excellent Discern Realities roll allowed E-Rock to determine that what he really needed to watch out for was the hole through which they had entered, and that the caged rabbit that Haruspex was carrying around was "not what it seemed" (whatever that means).<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief, bloody battle ensued. A few highlights were that Hugh failed to Defend Haruspex, resulting in the wizard getting knocked on his ass into the fire, the goblins got a nasty hit on Hugh later, knocking him down to about a third of his HP, and then he slew two of them in one swipe of his vicious, barbed blade. K-rock got in a good shot with his bow and Haruspex got his revenge with a magic missile, which he described as an immaterial glowing octarine spear made of energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharity was mostly happy defending others and healing via Lay on Hands this whole time, and also Parlayed a fellow PC successfully, to both their benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey miserably failed the roll to avoid the feral dogs in the next room, but Haruspex threw his rations at them in order to bait some of them away, while Hugh waded into melee with Martek rolling a 7 on Hack n' Slash using a fallen goblin's poisoned dagger, resulting in him stabbing the dog through the neck, and then it bit him back, but this caused it to sever its spine on his knife (he had rolled a 7, but also did enough damage to kill it outright.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, K-Rock, who had Spouted Lore about wild dogs in order to tell the wizard how to get them away, scared away the last one with a torch, in order to save it (and gained an XP). Naturally, Charity was happy to Lay on Hands for Martek (but really for another XP, bc her CHA was highlighted).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I had to leave, in order to go to my drill this morning. I had a hard time squeezing in more than a few rooms due to the widespread start times of my players, but we had fun with chargen. I personally had some issues with what to do on a 6-, both in cases where there was no 7-9 from which to draw a Hard Move from a previous Soft Move, and in cases like Discern Realities and Spout Lore. Also, Charity got a 5 on a Lay on Hands, so I ruled that she and Martek (the target) took 1 stun damage from the misalignment of their auras...or something. It felt lame, but I needed to think of something in order to move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also forgot to do the end of session stuff, like swapping highlighted stats and increasing Bonds.<br/>\nThanks for reading!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344646/#Comment_344646" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T11:47:47+00:00" title="October  1, 2011 11:47AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a 6&gt;, I quite often make a move unrelated to the action that failed.

Yeah, a big party's going to have a hard time sneaking past the wild dogs.   I can't wait to hear what's up with the rabbit (Is it sentient?  What does it know?  Was it something else originally?  What special thing can it do?  ...and what about those bones?)!   Aurora didn't a<span style="text-decoration: underline;">mount</span>  to much, that's great!  Do you think the ponies will be there when they get back or do you think Aurora led them to safety when that shambling thing showed up?  &lt;6, sounds like a good time for a log trap or a pit, maybe some goblins show up &lt;i&gt;en masse and push the players down separate tunnels.  Don't forget, just because the moss fluoresces doesn't mean its not slick as all get out - if you defied danger you might be ready for the thing at the bottom of the tunnel and not sliding on your butt!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344665/#Comment_344665" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T19:15:43+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  7:15PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a blast! Well done juggling the disjointed Chargen, despite this there is much story to discover there in the character's bonds. Aurora and the ponies definately have to get stolen from their pickets on a hard move (take away their stuff)  Just delight in the 'offscreen' vingette out on the surface and then ask 'what do you do?'. Priceless.<br>\n<br>\nThe combat sounded suitably heroic and story-orientated in true DW style, and for when you are handed a golden opportunity on a plate (like the failed lay on hands) what are some of the things you've been dying to introduce to the story? Introduce them! Stun damage isn't lame by the way, its direct and related to the move, you simply 'turned the move back on them'. Cool. I like how the gobbos have real personality. Don't forget to name them, give them a motivation related to a body part and use it to inspire their motivation / actions / dialogue. I love giving lowly goblins character.<br>\n<br>\nI really like 'telling them the consequences and ask'. So the Paladin may fail the lay on hands and gets a vision from their god, the healing will work, but only if they perform this deed...... If they refuse, well, WHAT?! You are refusing your god?! Or even ask the players. "what's the worst thing that could possibly happen to you right now?' Oh really......                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344668/#Comment_344668" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T20:03:11+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  8:03PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2011 8:04PM by UserClone.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, MAN! I've got it! The rabbits are actually something akin to land-based piranhas, devouring the ponies upon their escape (naturally the PCs will have to contend with battling them later). This even fits with a previous moment when they first found the hutches and Haruspex poked his finger in one and I decided that the rabbit snapped at him like it was hungry! Aurora manages to lead one or two ponies into a defensible position where she can defend them, like a bottleneck cave opening or something, but by the time the PCs get back out of the goblin hole, Charity won't have much time left to save her precious warhorse. Maybe E-Rock can help track her down, but will he do it for free?<br/>\n<br/>\nFuck yes!
