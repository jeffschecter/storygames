I base this (admitted) generalization on both the language used to discuss ideas on these boards and the design choices of the games being released or talked about.<br/><br/>So, my question is simple: Which resolution scale do you prefer <i>and why</i>? In particular, I'd like to hear both pros and cons for both methods and see if we can map out the strengths and limitations of each, e.g., if you prefer one, do you think the other might be better suited for a particular type of game or particular genre?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/warren" title="warren"><img alt="warren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wmerrifield.googlepages.com/GoPlayMario.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/warren">warren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74355/#Comment_74355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T06:16:30+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  6:16AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2007 6:32AM by warren.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I much prefer mechanical conflict resolution where each individual "bit" of narration encompasses the actions a single character takes to achieve a simple, specific goal (i.e. the Intent).<br/><br/>Larger scale (i.e. on a scene-by-scene basis) narration is a bit less to my taste; it feels like a more significant job, and you usually have less mechanical results to guide you.<br/><br/>My favourite is rather like DitV; smaller actions build to a significant outcome; one way or another. <br/><br/>And also, I find it better (both as a GM and player) that the Intent of every character involved in the conflict is clear to everybody at the table before the dice are thrown (or whatever) and anything happens ingame. It lets me get a feeling for the risk/reward trade-off before I commit to it (in the same way that I wouldn't want the croupier putting my money down on the craps table without me knowing what's going on. -- As an aside I wouldn't really want that same croupier to take less money than I owed if I rolled badly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74356/#Comment_74356" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T06:21:00+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  6:21AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I prefer conflict resolution for two reasons:<br/><br/>1) PRACTICAL - As a general rule, my time for gaming is limited and for us, conflict resolution is much less granular and thus speeds up play.  (For me, an extreme example of task resolution is d20 or Hero System combat - I love the principle, but don't have the time to lose a session to combat any more.)<br/><br/>2) PSYCHOLOGICAL - It helps me as a Referee or a Player to understand what is important to the other players and their characters.  Yes, you and should (and we do) discuss such thing before the game and before the sessions, but "forcing the subject" around each roll keeps it front of mind and can help proactively flag situations where the player or character's internal motivations shift mid-play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74357/#Comment_74357" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T06:24:36+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  6:24AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I honestly can't tell, in practice, which one I'm using any more.

Maybe you just need to try a little harder. ;-) Just this morning I read a post to the effect of "The game I'm designing will use conflict resolution, of course."<br/><br/>Might some of the distinction be related to granularity (as discussed in another thread)? E.g., "winning the duel" vs. "landing a rapier thrust and doing x points of damage".<br/><br/>Might some of the distinction be related to the actual temporal relationship between the narration and the mechanical resolution? Compare:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 1</span><br/>GM: There's a high wall surrounding the keep.<br/>Player 1: I try to climb it. I'll use my climbing gear to get a bonus.<br/>Player 2: I'll give him a boost.<br/>GM: OK, but the wall is slick so that's a penalty. Roll the dice.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 2</span><br/>GM(?): There's a high wall surrounding the keep.<br/>Player 1: I want to get into the keep.<br/>GM: OK, roll the dice.<br/>Player: [succeeds] With the help of my trusty climbing gear and a boost from my friend, I'm able to successfully scale the slick wall and get inside.<br/><br/>Maybe that's not an essential difference, but I see it in practice quite a bit.<br/><br/>(And, for the record, I'm with you Tony. I think the distinction is largely semantic ... as I will be trying to finally crystallize with Bullseye.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74360/#Comment_74360" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T06:39:00+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  6:39AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Terminology aside, I've very much come around to the opinion that I don't like resolution that produces "null" results.

That's what I'm going for with Bullseye ... umm, without the "horrifying" bit of course. I think a lot of that problem can be amelioriated by exactly what you all have seized on in this thread, i.e., not getting bogged down in semantic restraints. The timing and the granularity of the resolution should be suited to the present scenario.<br/><br/>But I don't want to derail my own thread.

I'm not too fond of tightly-specified outcomes except when the whole conflict is resolved in a single step - and in most cases anything uninteresting enough to resolve in a single step is also uninteresting enough to me that I wonder why I'm rolling for it at all. I like the way TSOY lets me start out with one intent in mind, but the intent can mutate as the conflict develops.

I don't really have much of a preference between small-scale vs. large-scale resolution (i.e., whether the mechanics resolve things blow-by-blow or resolve the entire fight with one roll) - some games work better with small-scale, some games work better with large-scale, and some games (*cough* TSoY) ingeniously incorporate both.  Why do I prefer conflict resolution?<br/><br/>The biggest reason is that all roleplaying games involve the resolution of conflicts.  The problem with task resolution (or, more specifically, intent-opaque resolution) is that the mechanics don't resolve the conflicts for you.  You can roll for all the tasks you want, but ultimately, succeed or fail, whether you achieve your goal is entirely up in the air, left to all that handwavey social stuff - which 99% of the time, means it's up to the GM.  As far as I'm concerned, that's pretty shaky game design right there.  I honestly believe that if task resolution didn't have the historical impetus that it does, no one would even consider the task- vs. conflict-resolution question - pretty much everyone would agree that conflict resolution is just better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Player says what they want to do. 2. GM says what skill they have to roll to do it. 3. Player rolls and succeeds of fails. 4. GM narrates what happens after the roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict resolution on the other hand seems to say 1. The player says what they want to do. 2. The GM helps them define what the stakes are. 3. The player role plays to build up their dice pool. 4. The player rolls and succeeds or fails. 5. If the player succeeds, they narrate how they win, if they lose the GM narrates how they fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat my games do is neither. 1. The player says what they want to have happen next - (Action - Result and Reasons) right up front. 2. A referee (another player in the game or a set referee) sets a "to happen" roll based off of their judgement of the argument. 3. The player rolls and succeeds or fails. 4. Successful argument become facts as written, failed argument just don't happen at all. At no time does the referee have narration powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... with a tear in my eye, I walk away knowing that my stuff doesn't fit in the catagories. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I do role play I frequently use task resolution because that is how the commercial games I own are written but I take a poetic reading the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paradoxdruid" title="Paradoxdruid"><img alt="Paradoxdruid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paradoxdruid">Paradoxdruid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74409/#Comment_74409" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T08:53:22+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  8:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's never black and white--  I'm much more used to Task Resolution systems, and I think they can be quite elegant.

Jacobson<br/>\n"Okay, but see my post above on the pitfalls of using "intent" as the term of choice. I don't think it's just semantics. In a pure task resolution system, every time you call on the resolution mechanic it's because you intend to succeed at the task."</b><br/>\n<br/>\n(Stoopid quote thing's not working for me)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's why conflict resolution is better, because it's there on every level.  If your intent really is just "I want to hit the orc with my sword", then rolling that die <i>is</i> conflict resolution, and not simply task resolution.  Because of his intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, in all likelyhood, if you asked him, "So, you just want to hit the orc, right?  It doesn't matter if you hurt him?" then the player will probably reply, "Oh, no.  I definitely want to hurt him."  To which you might ask, "Minimum damage ok?" and he'll likely say, "No!  Maximum damage, please.  Really, if I can kill him in one hit that would be optimal."<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you know his <i>true</i> intent.  If the die roll (or whatever) addresses the intent, then it's conflict resolution.  In the unlikely event that it's desperately important for a character to pick a lock (regardless of whether that actually unseals the door or there's anything to be found behind the door or any other kind of rational expectation) then even that "task" is conflict resolution.  It's just weird.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Anyway, to address that, I suppose you could call it "effect-based resolution", because we're talking about the players "intended effect" (intent).  Sort of an, "I hit him with my sword!"  "To what effect?"  "To kill him!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74462/#Comment_74462" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T11:17:12+00:00" title="June  8, 2007 11:17AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Might be excessively tangent-y, but an interesting illustration. I think of D&amp;D 3.5, played full-out Gamist, as having intent-relevant conflict resolution. Encounters have a fairly clear unitary win/loss outcome. Individual actions are all directed at the goal of defeating the encounter and progressing to the next one. Every action expends resources, and may incrementally advance you toward resolving the encounter.<br><br>In contrast, D&amp;D flounders in situations where the intent is not clearly connectable to component tasks. If you're trying to subvert the king's advisors, it's not like they have "loyalty hit points" you can wear down through use of social maneuvers. You have to either just roll a simple skill check and lose all the fun, unexpected details and tangents of actually playing through the conflict, or you have to "roleplay it out" with a bunch of tasks that may or may not have any meaningful impact on the outcome.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74469/#Comment_74469" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T11:23:13+00:00" title="June  8, 2007 11:23AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2007 11:26AM by Alan.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chris,<br>\n<br>\nPosted By: MatrixGamerConflict resolution on the other hand seems to say 1. The player says what they want to do. 2. The GM helps them define what the stakes are. 3. The player role plays to build up their dice pool. 4. The player rolls and succeeds or fails. ....<br>\n<br>\nDon't confuse narration rights with resolution. Distribution of narration rights are just a technique and can be used with either task or conflict resolution. Conflict resolution can end with <br>\n<br>\n5. GM always narrates what happens after the roll.<br>\n<br>\nAs other people have said, task resolution resolves only the success or failure of an imaginary action. Conflict resolution resolves the purpose of the action. <br>\n<br/>\nAlso, conflict resolution can be highly granual, as in DitV or Sorcerer.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, conflict resolution is actually needed for any roleplaying game. There's the example of opening the safe. I want to open the safe in hopes of finding incriminating evidence inside. <br/>\n<br/>\nConflict resolution would probably focus on my intent to find the incriminating evidence. In some games I'll use Safecracker skills with mods for the stethescope -- in others it'll be Screen Presence with bonus for activating your buddy Ed, the safe expert. The conflict might be broken into granual stages or not, depending on the details of the system. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Trollbabe, Burning Wheel, and Sorcerer are examples of systems that use granular conflict resolution. PTA is the daddy of one roll conflict resolution.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the dice (or cards or dominoes or revealed chits) indicate who wins, the most important point is that I get my intent -- ie I find the evidence. The point of description is both how I find the evidence and also how my chosen method positions me after the conflict is resolved. <br/>\n<br/>\nI might have opened the safe in complete silence and gotten the goods, or I might have opened the safe, triggered an alarm, and gotten the goods. In the latter, I actually won my roll, but some game mechanic (narration distribution, consequence table, etc.) allowed or required the complication of the alarm.<br/>\n<br/>\nTask resolution looks at the act of opening the safe and says: do you open the safe, yes/no? When you get it open, the roll says nothing about whether you get what you were looking for. Often the GM determines that by fiat.<br/>\n<br/>\nResolution of the intent of an action is conflict resolution. All roleplaying I've seen actually needs conflict resolution at some point, but until recently the written rules of many games have not addressed that. As I said, it often falls to an arbitrary decision by the GM, rather than by the dice roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, a task system can carry conflict resolution -- Burning Wheel does this explicitly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think someone else said that taks resolution doesn't really exist. I think all roleplaying uses conflict resolution -- some puts the decision on the dice, others put the decision on the GM or some other process. I think we could look at "Task resolution" is a misnomer for the old school approach of letting the GM decide results of intent while players provide details with task rolls.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74478/#Comment_74478" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T11:38:36+00:00" title="June  8, 2007 11:38AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>(Stoopid quote thing's not working for me)</blockquote>\nAh, no big; I'll have a comprehensive FAQ later.

Fred points out that the salient points are in terms of how and to what extent the system in question addresses the player's intent for a contest. Is the player's intent for goals considered at all? If so, is it taken into account explicitly or derived by guesswork? That sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone got a link to Fred's diagram? The reason that JD gets yelled at is because there's largely no consensus at all on what the Conflict/Task thing is about, while Fred's model is both clear and most people get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that "scale" in terms of how "much" the system in question resolves at a time is actually a different spectrum. You can have "task resolution" that resolves the task of commanding an army througout an entire war, if you like, and "conflict resolution" that resolves only how well your shoe tying excersize went. It's in part the conflation here that makes Fred's model's axes useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

If a player's character picks a lock successfully, but the lock doesn't unlock, he's going to be annoyed.  His intent, based on common sense or the description of the skill, isn't being met.  Most players would agree that such a result is either "cheating" or just "stupid".<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if every lock that the character successfully picks gives results like "Oh, that lock was fake" or "The door is unfortunately barred from the other side" or "The door magically re-locks itself", then even a die-hard TR player is going to get frustrated.  Maybe not at first, but perhaps by the third or fouth time that happens.  He'll feel that his success is being thwarted, because despite being all about "picking the lock" what he really wants is to get that door open.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere may be groups that don't like conflict resolution, on any scale.  If they don't like it, then obviously it's not "best" for that group.  Of course there may be groups of people that like getting hit in the head with bricks.

Druids pick up psionic powers with levels, and start off with Body Manipulation: Itch.  Yes, that's right: you can use your mind to make people itchy.  It gives them a -1 to strike, parry, or dodge if they fail their resist roll (which you only get if your ME is above 15, I think).  So that's the 'task-scale resolution' part.<br/><br/>In play, I used to do this trick: I'd walk up to some NPC in my druid robes.  I'd wave my hands and tell them that they were GEASED to do my bidding, or else a dire CURSE would befall them.  As I spoke, I'd use my druid powers to make them itchy, so they got a sensation that could be the magic spell falling on them.  They might resist the roll and therefore not be itchy, but there was no mechanical support on whether or not the hapless NPC actually did my bidding.  My brother, who was GMing, basically made a fiat decision.  He let the trick work a handful of times, and then had an NPC call my bluff.  At the time, I was perfectly happy with that state of affairs.  It was totally GM recognition and acknowledgement of "Hey, you were clever there, but don't go crazy with it."<br/><br/><strong>Anecdote the Second</strong><br/>Flash-forward to playing <em>Nobilis</em> a couple months ago.  We decide to go stir up trouble at the Locust Court.  The court officers enjoy torturing the poor souls brought before them for ridiculous, crazy-ass Nobilis crimes.  We step in and directly interfere with their enjoyment of the process without actually touching the process itself.  Then the court officers get all huffy and call us to the stand in an inquiry.  So I'm up on the stand, giving the court lip but not actually doing anything that's really and truly illegal.  This is all, it should be pointed out, a set-up to intimidate the Locust Court for the case coming up the next day: we're basically saying, "Rule in our favor or we'll come back and do this all the time."<br/><br/>So I'm sitting there playing, and I'm totally, totally rudderless.  I have nothing on my character sheet, I have no resources, I have absolutely no formal way of making it more likely that our gambit will work out.  All I'm doing is sitting there wondering if Judson, who is Hollyhocking, is going to think my roleplay is sufficient, and I <em>hated</em> that feeling.  Even after we got the ruling that we wanted in the next session, the experience of play right then was very uncomfortable for me.  It was, in rough form, the same social set up as my fourteen-years-ago TMNT game: the HG recognizes cool contributions but doesn't let them be perfectly effective, because then there'd be no need for new cool contributions.  But this time, I really didn't like it.  It wasn't Judson; it was me.  Teenager me was okay, perhaps even eager, to garner that sort of approval for creativity.  Adult me is profoundly disinterested in having improv creativity <em>judged</em>; I'm way more interested in building something cool with other players, and here I felt completely naked and toolless; I wasn't collaborating with the other players, I was submitting content to the HG-judge.<br/><br/>Now, as was pointed out before, neither of these examples is without conflict resolution -- it's just in the hands of the GM/HG to decide if the plan works out, and it's totally up to his discretion.  In fact, the 'task resolution' in both examples (a psionics resist roll or spending miracle points) is on the weak end of non-existence.  In terms of Fred's awesome table, I was in that middle column -- my intent was clear, and was merely advisory.  Which drove me up the <em>wall</em>.<br/><br/>So beyond conflict-versus-task, it's important to look at the social relationships that the rules create.  I'd actually prefer opaque intent over clear-but-irrelevant intent, because in that opaque column, I'm interacting with the other players, which is what I want to do, rather than making a suggestion and waiting to hear whether my suggestion is any good, which sucks ass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

The core difference between the two seems to be the difference between "discovery" and "invention", and I think we can agree that in general both have their place.<br/><br/>Task resolution is well tied to (and by saying this I'm trying to answer a question previously asked of me, because despite some of the argument above I will stand by my idea that one form might be intrinsically better suited to some settings, games, or interfaces than the other) discovery.  That is, when the philosophy behind the game design is such that a priveleged individual creates the true Story and, using the mechanism of the game to provide mediation of the truth about the Physics (and I'm capitalising these at once to be snooty but also to indicate that I want more out of them than their dictionary, GNS, or whatever meanings), we want a system that unveils the result.  The task resolution at its polar extreme takes our decisions as inputs and tests them against the truth machine, may mix in some random for variety (or verisimilitude) and churns out a Fact.  Discovery.<br/><br/>Conflict resolution, however, is (in its polar extreme) about Invention.  Rather than create truths, the system distributes narrative authority and generates direction for its application but does not state any Facts.  The player instead states the Facts and uses the result of the mechanism (including, usually, all of the inputs) to create a story consistent with the results -- the intermediate steps do not need resolution because we are not uncovering the Facts, we are authorising people to create them withing constraints of the results.  But she is empowered to elaborate a great deal -- there is less (or no) priveleged Story that has to be addressed and there is not really a secret being revealed.  The Facts are created by the system rather than revealed by them.<br/><br/>As with any pair of poles, the vast majority of geography is between them and in this case can be complicated as we have systems that encapsulate one within another or provide multiple mechanisms for use in different circumstances, but I think that where the interface of a game (or the setting proper, but obviously not the system as this generally *is* the system) meshes with the ideals of Discovery or Invention, we get a smoothly functioning game.<br/><br/>Dogs, for example, is about Invention.  The players create the details of the conflict and are not placing themselves in the hands of the Physics of the world (and I include here any attempts to create a Physics of communication that might act as a machine to churn out results in that vein) at all.<br/><br/>Dungeons and Dragons is about Discovery.  We are revealing the world of an authoritative GM as mediated through the Physics of the world, which are a simple and predictable machine whether for falling, striking, jesting, or knowing.<br/><br/>Thus, "it depends".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74552/#Comment_74552" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T14:05:55+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  2:05PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brad, Paul Czege and I used to call that the Columbus/Michelangelo dichotomy.

Or to phrase it in a more pleasing manner, while the GM may feel like he is operating as a truth machine neutrally arbitrating what happens according to the rules, the rules are simply procedures by which he invents what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74558/#Comment_74558" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T14:28:08+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  2:28PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not seeing the discovery/Invention parallel.  You can easily establish player intent and have the GM make up stakes that reflect that intent without the players "inventing" anything.  Similiarly, you can have a dumb "to-hit" roll and let the players describe the details based on how well they rolled and such.  I don't think narrative control really has much to do with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

a semantic argument about what that means because I think most people know what I mean when I say it), but it has two problems, in my experience. One, people like fiddly bits. Many of my co-gamers feel vastly unsatisfied when one roll (or draw) determines the outcome of an entire scene. Another is that conflit resolution is really not very conducive to exciting, stunty things. Games work well when there's interaction.<br/><br/>That's why, with <a href="http://indie-insurgent.livejournal.com/1768.html" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a> I am trying to do the blend, but in the not-horrible way. Set stakes, but then each roll describes things in a taskey way, which allows for flips and jumps and back-and-forth arguing and that sort of thing. Furthermore, there are many conditions where there are potential wins, so you state how you would win if it's unopposed. To me that kind of direction is pretty important. It's something I saw with some free-form MUSH roleplaying systems I was familiar with in the old days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74562/#Comment_74562" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T14:48:24+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  2:48PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            l don't think the discovery/invention parallel holds.

Easy.  Like I said, invest one player with the majority of creative authority, slap a moniker like GM or Producer or whatever on him or her, and then that player gets final authority over whether a player's stated intent is legal or not.  If a stated intent is made null and void by something that the GM-analogue knows but the player doesn't, then the intent isn't legal.  There you go, same potential for discovery as task resolution, same disproportionate amount of authority in the hands of the GM-analogue, only you get the benefit of the fact that conflicts are actually decided by the mechanics system, instead of left in the hands of fiat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74563/#Comment_74563" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T14:54:40+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  2:54PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert, it's true.

The Shadow of Yesterday and Spirit of the Century have several fiddly bits, and/or stunts, but they definitely use conflict resolution.  I think that a core idea behind conflict resolution is that there aren't any wasted actions (unless you choose to waste them).  That is, you'll never have a successful die-roll or the like that doesn't move you, however much, toward your overall goal.  Heck, two 1st level fighters fighting it out on a battlemap can be conflict resolution (if the goal is to disable the other guy).  Each hit absolutely wears down the other guy's hit points, bringing you closer to victory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74564/#Comment_74564" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T15:00:39+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  3:00PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2007 3:02PM by Mule.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conflict resolution mechanics focuses play on "Two (or more) people are in conflict.

The complexity of the system, however, determines the overall focus.  Now, on a board named  "Storygames: Do Not Put in Eye!!"

Jacobson</cite>Now we're really getting somewhere. But, in response to the emphasized text above, why? And, to push a little harder, for every genre, every group of players? That can't possibly be an absolute truth can it? (And not just on some technical philosophical grounds.) I think we can agree that the vast majority of gamers are firmly camped in the upper left box by virtue of playing by-the-book D&amp;D. As a general rule, you feel comfortable saying they'd have a better play experience if they shifted over a box or two?<br/><br/>I'm going to think about how to punch some specific holes in that statement.</blockquote>\nWell, RPGs being what they are, absolute statements like I made are sort of like walking into a minefield blindfolded.  But yeah, pretty much.<br/><br/>But, there's two weird things about RPGs (and life).  First, experience shapes expectation.  By this I mean, someone can define a fun rpg experience as "Something like that awesome game of AD&amp;D that Steve ran back in college."  And that's pretty common, in my experience.  So, depending upon what aspects of that game of AD&amp;D that the person latches onto, that can preclude conflict resolution from giving them a good time.  The second thing about RPGs that is weird is that people have procedural biases.  Like, one guy might just not like roll under systems.  He can't stand any system that uses roll under.  So, it's totally conceivable that someone might have a procedural bias that stops conflict resolution from working for them - I've actually seen this, in the form of "I don't like to state my intent."<br/><br/>So, technically speaking, would every single person necessarily be happier using CR than TR?  No, because we're not all robots.  There's all kinds of weird, difficult-to-measure, nothing-to-do-with-efficacy-or-efficiency shit that gets put on the scales in our mind when we're judging a game system.  However, if people didn't have those sorts of hang-ups?  Yup, I honestly believe that conflict resolution would be flat-out better for all people in all cases.<br/><br/>Now, you asked me if I thought that all those people playing D&amp;D by-the-book would necessarily be having a better play experience if they did conflict resolution instead?  That's difficult to answer.  It's not like CR is some magical key; turn it, and *poof!* your gaming is fun.  It avoids all sorts of difficulties that task resolution doesn't deal with, makes it very easy to implement more equal authority across the table, but doesn't <i>necessitate</i> that increased authority on the part of the non-GM players.  But if the people you're playing with are dicks, it won't save you from a shitty time.  But yeah, given that they don't have other, larger problems standing in the way of a fun experience, and given that they could get around personal hang-ups and procedural biases, I think most people would get reliably better experiences out of conflict resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74571/#Comment_74571" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T15:09:54+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  3:09PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find myself agreeing muchly with Fred about how the "traditional" (i.e. Forge) terms here are really unhelpful to clear communication. HIs diagram is a big improvement, IMO.<br/><br/>But I'm not sure I entirely understand the matter of player intent being factored into resolution. Can someone give me a clear example of the same situation being handled in the two different manners? Do economics-based mechanics such as Fate Points count? Or is an element of invention needed?<br/><br/>Ludanto, I think there is some connection between clear intent and invention. In order to state an intent beyond the "simple intent" of "I just want to do this", you have to at least speculate about what the result will be of doing that ("I'm doing this to impress the King"). By doing so, you are making a statement about causal connections in the world that may not actually be justified in other players' minds. In a "task resolution" system, whether you impressed the King might be down to what the GM thought the King would be impressed by, or what was written in a scenario book. In most "conflict resolution" systems, it's going to be a lot more fun if your declarations define how the world really is, rather than the GM constantly disallowing your stakes because they don't flesh with her vision.<br/><br/>Dan (fifth child): if you think the right hand column is always better, what do you say to those players who claim that their sense of fun depends on a clear game/metagame division? Are they simply mistaken about their needs?

D&amp;D's skill set is pretty close, if you handwave the "DM sets the difficulty" away.  So if I say, "I'm going to impress the king by leaping around, my jump check is +20" and the system says "In order to impress anyone you must make a diplomacy check of DC 20", then there's a mechanic for the conflict, right there.  The mechanic just says "You didn't make a diplomacy check, you made a jump check: you fail."<br/><br/>That's not how straight D&amp;D works, but again, focus of play.

I will be satisified if we get there.  <br/><br/>To get to the third column seems to move from "You tell me what you are trying to accomplish, roll, I tell you whether you accomplished your goal, and the consequences of your sucess/failure."  <br/>To "You tell me what you want to accomplish, roll, I tell you whether you were sucessful, you tell me the consequences of your success/failure."  <br/>Or, alternatively, "You tell me what you want to accomplish and consequences of your success/failure, roll, I tell you whether you were sucessful."  <br/>Or, ultimately, "You tell me what you want to accomplish and consequences of your success/failure, roll, the dice/system tells you whether you were sucessful."<br/><br/>This seems to get into Narration right issues that I don't want to delve into with my players (yet).  <br/><br/>The first column seems to be Task Resoultion.  The second seems (to me) to be Conflict Resolution.  The last column seems (to me) to be Conflict Resolution with more on top of it.

The feel of an Invention or a Discovery game is pretty much entirely illusory -- the players feel as though they are inventing or discovering, but of course it's all invention from some angle.  But that illusion is really really important to some people -- if you read through some of the GM authority threads on RPGnet you will find that this is exactly the underlying illusion that many are trying to preserve when they argue for a dominating story authority at the table.  I suspect that conflict resolution is better tooled to deliver an Invention feel and task resolution is better tooled to deliver Discovery, but I happily acknowledge that you can leverage either into either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74600/#Comment_74600" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T17:06:07+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  5:06PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How much of this really all comes down to negotiating known (pre roll) outcomes?

Or a series of checks that, if successful, will lead to release of the sister?<br/><br/>So this would be my approach\xe2\u20ac\xa6.<br/><br/>Tumble check and then Diplomacy check.<br/><br/>Tumble check.  <br/>DC-5 or lower, King thinks the PC is a buffoon and Diplomacy check automatically fails, but a Noble nearby realizes how desperate the PC is and will offer the PC a deal that will have consequences for the Noble\xe2\u20ac\u2122s help.  <br/>DC to DC-5 King is unimpressed.  <br/>DC+5 to DC King is unimpressed, but a Noble nearby is impressed and the PC gets +5 to diplomacy check with that Noble later on.  <br/>DC+5 or better, King is impressed and PC gets a +5 on Diplomacy check to secure the release of the sister.<br/><br/>Diplomacy check.<br/>DC-5 or lower, King rejects the PC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s plea, but a Noble nearby realizes how desperate the PC is and will offer the PC a deal that will have consequences for the Noble\xe2\u20ac\u2122s help.<br/>DC to DC-5, King rejects the PC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s plea, but a Noble nearby will offer his help to the PC latter.  Whether this deal will have consequences or not will be determined by another Diplomacy check.<br/>DC+5 to DC, King frees the sister, but with a consequence attached.<br/>DC+5 or more, King frees the sister.<br/><br/>In this way the PC will eventually succeed, but the cost to succeed will be a range of possibilities.  <br/><br/>Some of this was player invention (tumble to impress the King.)  Most was GM invention (the role of the Noble).  All of it worked to get the PC to what he wanted, but the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s stats and the luck of the dice drove how much it was going to cost (from nothing for complete success to owing the king a favor to owing a noble a favor to falling into league with a bad noble).   <br/><br/>For me the invention does not lie in what the PC wishes to accomplish.  That's what makes Conflict Resolution what it is.  Task Resolution is making a check (or series of checks) without a goal expressed and agreed upon.  Conflict Resolution is a check(s) with a goal expressed and agreed to.  Invention comes in the form of how does the check(s) accomplishes the goal and what are the consequences for success and failure.<br/><br/>Releasing the sister wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t an Invention of the Player, it was what he was trying to accomplish.  Impressing the King was an Invention of the player to accomplish this goal.  The Noble was an Invention of the GM to provide a fallback and consequences in the case of failure.  The Player could made a Knowledge Nobility check to Invent a Noble who has influence with the King, if the group shares Narration Rights like this.  Thus he could have Invented another way to accomplish his goal in the case of failure.  In this case, if he failed the roll, I would have made the Noble someone who would have exacted a high price for releasing the sister.  On a success, the Noble is someone who will deal more fairly with the PC.  And so on\xe2\u20ac\xa6 <br/><br/>Ultimately, for me, I am trying to create Resolution that moves the story forward, even if the check is a failure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M" title="Robert M"><img alt="Robert M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M">Robert M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74603/#Comment_74603" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T17:21:21+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  5:21PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Robert M:<br/>As a suggestion, I've found that this stuff really works best with skills in an otherwise traditional set of game mechanics.

The intent is built in: incapacitate the opponent. How do we know when he's incapacitated? <b>Not</b> simply by GM judgment, but when the system says so: he's out of hit points. So, we attempt tasks to achieve that intent, roll vs a DC, and when his hit points go down, we know that we're getting somewhere.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel takes this idea and expands it to verbal arguments with its Duel of Wits.<br/><br/>Still "task" based, small-scale, and incremental, but it's firmly conflict resolution. Just like DitV. Expanding that core idea to other areas in D&amp;D would probably work just fine. You could make stealth attacks against a sentry's "security" hit points, for instance. Or diplomacy attacks against the Baron's "reluctance" hit points.<br/><br/>If players are comfortable with the level of abstraction, so-called "metagame", and system-interaction of D&amp;D combat, they might also be cool with sneaking battles, battles of wits, and such like.  To simplify things, you might adapt the damage save mechanic from Mutants and Masterminds. Instead of using hit points, your target makes a saving throw against the damage you have done to it. So, the Baron might make a Will save against the amount of Diplomacy damage your speech did, modified by the Baron's skills and feats as needed.<br/><br/>All that is to say: D&amp;D has a CR system already, just a very narrow and specialized one. Most traditional rpg players are familiar with it and seem to enjoy it, so that may be a good foundation from which to explore other CR opportunities in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/binarysins" title="binarysins"><img alt="binarysins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/binarysins">binarysins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74747/#Comment_74747" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-09T22:52:35+00:00" title="June  9, 2007 10:52PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of what is termed "conflict resolution" is really interested in encapsulation. In other words, how do the results of resolution interact with one another. In most traditional rpgs, some tasks may be dependent on others to succeed or even be attempted, but the results of one roll do not directly affect the others. In other words, rolling really well on your stealth check won't help your lockpicking attempt. In most conflict resolution setups I've seen, there is little encapsulation - the stealth check and the lockpicking attempt are intertwined.<br/><br/>Personally? I think that all of it is conflict resolution, dependent on scope and encapsulation (and, yes, I am borrowing programming terms). Often traditional games will boil down one task ("Automobile repair") into one roll, but break down climbing a wall, sneaking past the guards, and picking the lock into separate tasks. They slide between different scopes for different skill rolls, which is really the way it should be. Flexible games will include solid guidelines for when to use task or conflict resolution during play, but I don't think they should be 100% one way or the other. I guess this places me in the "It depends" camp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74750/#Comment_74750" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-09T23:32:14+00:00" title="June  9, 2007 11:32PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2007 11:33PM by Mule.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: binarysins</cite><br/>Personally?

A lot of the appeal for me of conflict mechanics is <em>generalized</em> conflict mechanics, and player authority to set "stakes".  "Does the guard see me?" is indeed a conflict, but if what I care about is "Do I get away with the Sultan's crown?" then it's nice to be able to have mechanics that clearly indicate <em>which</em> conflict my actions are affecting.  Once you have that, the cascading "whys?" someone mentioned earlier take care of themselves; the players set the pace of progress along the story themselves.  If what I want is to get my sister released, then my ability to set stakes allows that to be at the forefront.<br/><br/>Not <em>everything</em> is a conflict, though.  So a character is trying to do something, and the players think it'd be cool either way, so they use dice or cards or whatever to determine.  How I see the task/conflict difference is; "Is some fictional character pushing the other way?"  So if TonyLB is climbing through some fair maiden's windows, and we decide to have rolls, we can have: <strong>Task:</strong> "Roll to see if your thews bulge," or <strong>Conflict:</strong> "Roll to see if the princess is impressed with you."  These two rolls can even be <em>the same roll</em>, if you want.<br/><br/>So, I think of focus of play.  Do I want a character sheet full of ways to interact with making my character's thews bulge?  Or do I want a character sheet full of ways to interact with making my character impress the ladies?  Different kinds of play call for different kinds of answers, for me.  Both <em>need</em> to be answered some way, it's just the level of involvement in answering it that differs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74769/#Comment_74769" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-10T07:01:07+00:00" title="June 10, 2007  7:01AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How I see the task/conflict difference is; "Is some fictional character pushing the other way?" </blockquote>\nHunh. I see it more like: Is another player pushing the other (or a different) way?<br/><br/>I'm not sure that's particularly a ConRes thing, so much as a deal where you choose which rolls to make or not. If everyone is in agreement that thngs go a certain way, why bother rolling?<br/><br/>Mind you it can shift things to weird places. Stealing from the investigation situation that comes up regularly ( the evidence finding in the office), you could have everyone at the tale agreeing that clues of some sort are found, but the conflict being resolved is whether Sam the Safecracker finds them in the safe, Hal the Hacker finds them on the computer, or Bumbling Joe the Comic Relief finds them setting out in plain sight while the other characters are busily being serious and professional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

That is, there's no connection between a task that we've resolved and anything else, ever, in the game.

And saying that D&amp;D; has a conflict resolution system is ignoring pretty much what everybody (except for Harper) else is saying in terms of what these things mean. JD's confusion may be because of statements like yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, this is why I've gone over to Fred's diagram. There's more consensus there on the meanings, and it's actually useful by that definition.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I forgot to mention my preference. I'm in the middle column for intent. The reason being that, while I think that taking intent into account gets us to resolution of the things I find important more quickly, I also find that being too explicit about intent before hand drains suspense, and is unneccessary. I think that many people move to the third column when discovering the power of understood intent, thinking that more of a better thing can't be bad. But once you've tried that a bit, you may find that, in fact, going back to a happy medium where we're not always so explicit is actually more fun.

It may <em>also</em> "always" be a part of a conflict (two or more fictional characters in opposition over something else,) but it still <em>exists</em>, and must therefore be dealt with.<br><br>The question is, how long do you want to take dealing with it?  Most hippie task mechanics boil down to "sure, if you think your guy can do it, he can".  Other times, narration gets determined by dice/cards.<br><br>"The bright [1:blue/pink] sky contrasts with my character, Grimthorn the Mighty, as he climbs through the twelfth story window into the princess's chamber. My mighty thews [2: bulge/do not bulge] with the effort, and the princess inside is [3: impressed/not impressed] with my strength."<br><br/>1.  Not task or conflict, since <em>no</em> characters are acting on the color of the sky.  If we still use dice to determine it, it is just "narration mechanics"?  Why don't I hear about this classification of mechanical resolution more often?<br/>2.  Task.  No other character is acting on Grimthorn's thews other than Grimthorn.  Can he make them bulge?  How <em>much</em> can he make them bugle?  If we roll dice/cards/etc, we've got a Task Mechanic.<br/>3.  Conflict!  Two characters, Grimthorn and The Princess, both in oposition over The Princess's impressed-osity (that's totally a word).  Maybe the conflict depends on the task of the thews bulging, maybe it doesn't.  Depends on the rules.<br/><br/>Now, why bother rolling for a task that has no mechanically associated conflict?  For <em>narration rights</em>.  Why make an involved system to deal with narration rights over something other than characters interacting with each other?  Because, darn it, sometimes I just want to shoot lasers out of my eyes and have play be <em>about</em> that.<br/><br/>One question I have is why narration "fork points" are divided into these categories.   Is it a design attempt to highlight places in the story where fictional characters are in opposition?  It seems like there are narration disputes outside either category, but I often see them lumped together with "conflict" mechanics.<br/><br/>EDIT:  Maybe, what you mean by "There is no such thing as Task Resolution" is that no game lacks Conflict resolution, because conflicts always occur and must therefore be resolved?  If so, I totally agree with you, but don't see "Task Resolution" as the antithesis of "Conflict Resolution".  They sound like they're two different things that happen in parallel, and sometimes you've got lots of dice and rules to deal with one of them but not the other.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75062/#Comment_75062" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T05:34:21+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  5:34AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, the question is not whether or not the player has intent - obviously they always have that. But whether the end result of a contest can be tailored to intent, or if the player has to select some task from a list that has X outcome mechanically every time. The selected action is the "Task." So, for instance, the player's intent may be to kill somebody. Is there a rule that allows that to be the outcome of a resolution die roll? No? You have to select "Hit the target for damage" as your option if you want to kill something? Then that's a Task Resolution system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's just an example, don't take it as definititve. This is why Fred's model is better here, because I probably won't get anyone to agree with me that this is the definition of Task Resolution. But it's the only functional and important definition I can see. As long as people are trying to find a way to collapse the whole Task/Conflict thing, using semantics relating to the definitions of the two selected words (instead of using a definition applied to a compound term), nobody gets anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Just because it's called "conflict" resolution doesn't mean that there has to be another character for you to compete against.  Grimthorn can totally be in "conflict" with his thews.  As for the narration rights, if there's some kind of system to decide narration rights and it addresses the player's issue with the color of the sky, then that's confict resolution as well.  I'm not saying that task resolutio is the "antithesis" of conflict resolution.  I'm saying that it is "less" than conflict resolution, in that conflict resolution can do the same things as task resolution, only better, and also things that task resolution doesn't handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike, interesting point, though I think it's less about "tailoring" to intent and more about "addressing" it.  If the rules for swinging a sword say that the bad-guy will lose hit points and at 0 hit points you kill him, then each swing of the sword addresses the player's intent, however slowly.  That's still conflict resolution, just drawn out.  It's only "task resolution" if the result of the attack ingnores the intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nJustin, yeah, probably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75101/#Comment_75101" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T08:07:49+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  8:07AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I probably won't get anyone to agree with me that this is the definition of Task Resolution.</blockquote> Hey, it works for me.

But some would argue that this "danger" is acceptable, because they want to avoid the "loss" of the feeling of game world objectivity that they feel goes away with addressing player intent. Or, for gamism, a sense of balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Player 1 has his diplomat character come face to face with a terrible ogre. The GM says that the ogre attacks. A "combat" ensues, and player 1's character ends up dead.<br/>\n- Player 2 has his diplomat character meet said ogre. The GM says that the ogre attacks. The player says that he's going to try to get the ogre to back off (perhaps even become friendly) by using his diplomacy skills. The GM allows this, and the player gains a new powerfull ally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this sort of game, allowing player intent to be addressed in the outcome is "unfair." Or, if applied to everyone, then all challenges can be resolved with the character's best skill. The player of the diplomat will always use his diplomacy, and never has to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf playing narrativism, the player will accept the arena of conflict being combat at times, knowing his character is far more likely to fail, because he's not interested in showing off his tactical prowess as a player, but in creating drama. So losing is, for this player, as good as winning in the right circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, very genrally speaking, we can see how ignoring player intent on goal is important to one sort of play, and how paying attention to it is important for another. Now, I've used GNS modes here as examples, but don't get to thinking this is definitive or one to one. There are probably narrativists out there who prefer not to have intent taken into account so directly. There are probably "gentleman gamists" who are less interested in maneuvering the system than they are in how the direction of their character's actions gains them advantage, and think intent is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that all these can be valid sorts of play. The implication that some on the side that says that paying attention to intention is better make often about those who don't pay attention to intent as much, is that the people who avoid intent are just scared of "abuse" (which they might then say comes from the bad systems they play). And while this phenomenon might exist, that's not to say that there aren't lots of folks who have a valid interest in this "fair" playing field that tends to ignore intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76034/#Comment_76034" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T20:12:47+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  8:12PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, your point about what is essentially "immersion" is a good one, and if immersion takes precedence over most other aspects of the game, then I suppose that method of play is the best you're going to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your examples, I'm not suggesting that players have carte blanc to dictate the effectiveness of their tactics.  In the dipolomacy example, it would be perfectly valid for the GM to levy stiff penalties for sweet-talking a murderous ogre (perhaps making fight or flight a better idea), or outright letting the player know that it's just not going to work, ever.  Then, with the GM understanding intent, and the player understanding the potential for risk and reward, they move on to the diplomacy check, or maybe the PC decides on a different tactic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for "abuse", there's always the worst-case scenario, but supposedly that doesn't happen that often in actual play (from what I hear).  For being "fair", if that's a concern, then intent is all the more important, since your opponent (the GM) is also the the referee, and in charge of your overall effectiveness after the roll.  In a role so full of conflict-of-interest, clear intent/stakes should probably be mandatory (IMO).<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, high-functioning TR can work, and work well, but by that same token, I can drive a screw with a penny and have it work just fine, despite not being the best tool for the job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_76154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76154/#Comment_76154" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T21:01:25+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  9:01PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Task?

In a typical D&amp;D game, if the safe is empty, you can bet that JD's point is spot on, i.e., the emptyness is relevant in some fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76344/#Comment_76344" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T06:17:30+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  6:17AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In any game using any type of resolution, the safe being empty <span style="text-decoration: underline;">could</span> be relevant.<br><br>The Safe Example, a classic, is problematic in several ways in any case.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76352/#Comment_76352" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T06:49:07+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  6:49AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fine, we'll assume that there is a GM and a pre-written adventure.

Sherlock Holmes faked a fire in order to get Irene Adler to show him where she hid an incriminating photograph rather than just searching everywhere. If I tell my players "there's really no way to tell where the thing you're looking for is just by randomly looking around" (most identified-as-task-resolution systems I've seen have sections on 'impossible tasks'), they know to go another route - trickery, magic, bribery, etc. You've created an impossible task in this example, but assumed that nobody would tell a player that it's impossible.

(Let's skip the side issue of whether they can "create" the dirt or not. This is old-skool stuff, not hippy sharted world creation stuff here).<br/><br/>You, Mr. or Ms. GM have decided that indeed there are clues to be found. You put them on the computer. <br/><br/>The character has no computer skills. Oops. The player wanted a cat-burglar, not a hacker. Being all cat-burglary, they go for the safe.<br/><br/>So, Mr.GM, what are you going to do?<br/><br/>1) Force pixel-bitching and side-quests?<br/>2) Accept that the players may miss an important bit of info?<br/>3) Move the damn clue?<br/><br/>Me, I'll go with the following preference order: 3-1-2. I'll particularly go with that order if we're talking about a one-shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76427/#Comment_76427" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T10:21:33+00:00" title="June 18, 2007 10:21AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I go with 2-1-3.<br/><br/>If the info is so important that the scenario fails if the players don't find it, then even if you use CR, you've either constucted a bad scenario or agreed to bad stakes when you posed the question "Do the PCs get the dirt?"<br/><br/>If the scenario doesn't require dirt-getting, then the question is resolved via so-called TR in two steps: (1) Do the players search the right place? (2) Do they make their safecracking skill?<br/><br/>Assuming a prewritten scenario, that is, not GM manipulation behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Pixel-bitching is a side issue, depending on player interest and other factors. In some games, keeping track of game time used for TR makes pixel-bitching moot. (If it were a dungeon in the old days, repeated searches would have meant eventual wandering monster rolls and/or using up resources.) If time isn't made to be a factor, then of course the GM should just tell the players everything they'd find in a thorough search plus iterative die rolls on any task that can be repeated until success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76436/#Comment_76436" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T10:43:06+00:00" title="June 18, 2007 10:43AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, we can move the clue, and I might well, depending on the scenario, the expectations of the group, and a bunch of other factors.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that has much to do with the benefits of CR as game system, though. Even when using TR, we generally have a pretty good idea of why the player is trying to open the safe, after all.<br/><br/>But it seems to me that if your game runs in such a way that the only stakes you can reasonably set are things like "if you succeed, you open the safe and find out what's inside", then you're not getting much benefit from CR, to put it mildly. This is what I mean when I say that although CR may in theory be independent of matters such as narrative rights, in practice, it seldom works out that way. That's why I scratch my head a bit when people tell me that CR is invariably superior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3276%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3276%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Conflict Resolution vs. Task Resolution: Which Do You Like Better and Why? - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Conflict Resolution vs. Task Resolution: Which Do You Like Better and Why? - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I dunno about invariably better.

Toss out all the rolls neither you nor your GM give a shit about, sweet! Let's get down to the crux of the matter and get on with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I totally get how systems where you roll, say, "safecracking" or "security" or something to see if the player earns narrative authority to create a clue inside a safe -- but calling it "conflict resolution" leaves me confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked Bob's thought that what we're really talking about is a difference between character-level conflicts (I need to get this door open) and player-level conflicts (I need my character to find a vital clue beyond this door).<br/>\n<br/>\np.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76519/#Comment_76519" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T15:19:58+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  3:19PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2007 3:20PM by Mule.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how I see it is:<br/>"Do I beat the safe" is me vs. something that's not a character (unless we're in a story where it is).<br/>"Do I beat the Crime Lord" is me vs. a character, so it'd be a conflict.<br/><br/>Opening a safe <em>could</em> be a conflict if there were two people opposing each other over it.  In Dogs it would be, because there's always someone on the other side.  In D&amp;D it usually isn't, and the "open lock" roll is a task.  Interestingly, sometimes in D&amp;D it <em>is</em> a conflict; someone's rushing through the door to stop you, or someone's shooting arrows at you while you safecrack, etc.<br/><br/>You could even make a conflict out of safecracking with "Do I beat the safemaker?"  Your character will be doing the exact same things as the task of cracking the safe, but now there's an actual character opposing him, even if from 50 years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3276/conflict-resolution-vs-task-resolution-which-do-you-like-better-and-why/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3276%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3276%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
