                    Not, y'know, a universal manifesto ... just a thing I thought up.<br/>
<br/>
I had a system where people were handing dice back and forth to each other:  You'd roll your own dice, then they do into a fan-mail-type pool.  From there they get handed to other players (who can use them to aid or screw you, because it's their influence over your thinking) and then when they get spent from there they go back to you.<br/>
<br/>
Only problem was, in order to give the system the sort of "hand out things like candy kisses!" mentality I wanted, I was giving people a pool of 12 dice.  Second, that's an awful lot of dice to parse through when you're looking at a roll.  But first, that locks out people who do not have twelve dice per player on hand, which outside of dedicated gamers means <i>everybody</i>.<br/>
<br/>
So my little idea was that you could replace all but three of those dice with tokens.  Each token is worth 1.  If you spend a die, it is worth whatever you roll.  If you spend two dice then you can choose <i>one</i> of them (after rolling) to be worth what you rolled ... the other one is worth one.  Likewise on three dice.  You have three dice and nine tokens, which you shuffle around through the economy (from you to the pot, from the pot to someone else, from someone else to you) the same way.<br/>
<br/>
I think my favorite part of this (other than that it speeds up game-play without, I think, sacrificing much in the way of structure) is that the tokens can be <i>anything</i>, as long as they're distinctive.  If you want to use silver skull-beads when you play your goth-emo-boy, feel free.  Me, I'm'a use little plastic dinosaurs ... for any character.  They're always appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
No big question.  Just a little joyful babbling.                </div>

                            I really think everyone's token set needs to be different.  It's a teenage game.  There's a difference between using the strength that comes from within, and the strength that other people have given you by expressing an opinion about you.  As a result, you really do need to know whose tokens are whose.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to get it down to fewer dice, but I think that the same reasoning applies.  There's a real statement to be made by saying "Okay, I am expressing the opinion that you are, deep down, underneath all the obnoxious shit, a stand-up guy" and passing across a DIE of your color, rather than just one of your tokens.  Because of that, I'd like the dice to circulate as the tokens do, which means different dice.<br/>
<br/>
Not <b>that</b> big a deal, though.  Even non-gamers can, IME, scrape together a few dice.  It's not as easy as playing-cards, but it's usually doable.                        </div>

                            Hmm.

<p>d6s are beautiful. They're stable when you move them around on a table, so you can group all your matching results without accidentally changing a result.</p>
<p>Tony: you might want to consider using one token = five dice (or some other multiple,) or two kinds of themed tokens, also, at least if you plan on having a lot of tokens in play. This thought occurred to me when I was reading <em>UnSpeakable</em> (Jared's Lovecraftian version of <em>InSpectres</em>.) I read the rules and yelped "I don't have 30 to 60 d6s!"</p>

                            I've been moving more in the token direction too. Poker has taught us that chips are resources. Craps has taught us that dice are chances. (In your context, someone likes you vs. someone <i>might</i> like you.) Giving and taking resources has a more controlled feeling to me so I'm marginalizing the dice. Keeping them, but making it so that relying on luck is a last resort.                        </div>
