I wish I saw James' advice before we played because trying to explain how the fuck things work dragged down the first half of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, it went quite well. We played for \xb13 hours, and only got one Exit (a Faction) and decided to end it there, but we definitely enjoyed ourselves. It's a great game. After two Conflicts, every one clicked and things went smoothly. We played a lot for keep though, and I think the game might have been more nervous if, for example, players didn't restrained from erasing nCons when losing a conflict scene, or jumped right to the point instead of trying too much to tie the last scene to the next. Ellipses are good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main bump was : when do we end a scene ? A few players didn't know when to stop and dragged the scene, either because they were looking for a conflict that would not happen, or because they lost the scene and wouldn't let the narrative power go. It wasn't fun for them (because they were clearly lost) nor for the others. Calling a Color scene early or daring to cut a scene at some climax point really helpedn ('okay, I lost and I'm dangling by the collar from the ginormous fist of Sven, the cyberviking biker. I tell him "sorry man, I've no idea where the PDA is" and the scene ends here').<br/>\n<br/>\nShort scenes and abrupt endings are great because they're evocative and give the other players something to cling to and base a scene upon, without dragging the game. As the evening progessed, our scenes were shorter and shorter and the game kept getting better and better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, we're scheduling the next game and this time, nobody leave the table before we figure out what happened to Bambinator, the cybernetic fawn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
