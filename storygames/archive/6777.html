Does it accomplish that?  <br/><br/>On the surface there are some immediately suggested problems with the skill challenge.  <br/><br/>1. A complexity of 1 requires that my success to failure ratio be better than 4:2.  At complexity level 2, it is only 6:3.  The ratio of successes to failures has dropped; it seems easier.  (If I am more than 65% likely to succeed at an individual skill check, this is true.)  <br/><br/>2. At a given level, what is my chance of success for a given skill check?  If it is around 50% does this make sense?  What do I stand to lose or gain?  Should I risk it?<br/><br/>3. How reliable should a skill challenge be?  Would I ever undertake a skill challenge with a chance of success on a single trial around 50%?  Probably not, unless I only needed a few successes.  (If I had to flip a coin and get two heads before two tails, what do I know?  I could flip: hh, tt, hth, thh, tht, htt; I'd have a 50% chance of flipping two heads before two tails.  Now extend that, what if I had to get three heads before two tails, my chances drop below 1/3.  Now get 4h before 2t, below 20%... I don't think I'd try it if I stood to loose much.  Where'd my fun go?)<br/><br/>4. The skill challenge produces an s-curve probability distribution. This indicates some problematic characteristics, depending on certain properties of the curves. <br/><br/>Intuitively, you can see there are problems.  Does the math bear out the intuition?<br/><br/>I've checked each complexity level with both an analytical model and a monte carlo simulation and both are in agreement.  If the party has less than a 65% chance of success in a single skill check, then the chances are very low that they will succeed in a skill challenge (about 42%), with decreasing odds as the complexity increases.  However, with chances greater than 65%, the skill challenges get easier as complexity increases.  Neither of these things seems to make sense.<br/><br/>However, changing the model to make the party more likely to succeed at a skill challenge than any individual would have been at a single check, doesn't sound like a reasonable answer either, or does it?<br/><br/>Is it broken in play? What is the typical single skill check success rate? (I've based most of my evaluations on some quick calculations)<br/><br/>What would you do to accomplish the stated goal of skill challenges?  What are you doing?  Does it work?  Is it fun?<br/><br/>(I'd be happy to discuss the analytical models with anyone who cares.)<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><br/>Success at the challenge should be important to the adventure, but not essential. <br/>--DMG p 72</blockquote>\n to include questions                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150811/#Comment_150811" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T21:48:39+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  9:48PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a gamist game like D&amp;D, I assume players would focus on skill checks which they have high skill scores.<br/><br/>So far, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/updates" rel="nofollow">WotC's 4E errata</a> has not addressed Skill Challenges.

Most hardcore types I know who have looked at the skill challenge section say the same thing:<br/><br/>"So... now I roll Diplomacy 6 times in a row instead of just once? Yeah, that's a big improvement."<br/><br/>Putting a cap on the number of times you can use one skill (your best, naturally) just shifts things to your next best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150839/#Comment_150839" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T06:39:34+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  6:39AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            making everyone roll multible times as apposed to one person once is a big improvement i think. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt treats it like an event rather than an annoyance. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as putting caps on the number of times you can use your best skills, yeah it does shove it to your next best. But its also context specific. In 3.x the situation would dictate the roll, now in 4 the situation doesn't dictate, it allows more of that lateral thinking that I think story gamers would be happy about (even if the sidways thinking is how can i use my best skill in a context senstive way when the immediate context does not seem to support it). <br/>\n<br/>\nExample, in one of my own skill challenges, we have a fairly 3.x ish fighter type. athletics, intimidate, endurance, etc. Oh noes we have a skill challenges. Where in 3.x the fighter would turn off until a monster shows up, we have in 4 the fighter climbing trees to check out the surrounding area, AND IT BENEFITS THE PARTY. Atheletics check for the win. In a different one i had the fighter literally carrying everybody's stuff with endurance checks so that they wouldn't get movement penalties or hide penalties when scouting endurance check for the win. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the questions asked:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I think this is true more or less regardless. It also has the odd effect of making easier skill challenges harder at higher complexities if it came to that althought that's not supported as written. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. I think the PC's should have a substantial chance of success. Arround 50%. The home patch i am using puts it at 70%+<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Just in reference to the above, not this "I don't think I'd try it if I stood to loose much. Where'd my fun go?)" As for the reliable part. the skill challenge in order to be useful to be dm should be reliable. I mean if i used the same rules and produces wildly different results for no particular reason or intention i would consider that bad design. (maybe awesome if the game was build arround it but still its like rolling a d20 and getting i, It would confuse me more than a little<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Does the math bear out the intuition? I think it probably more a question of whether the play bears out to the mathetmatic modling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson" title="Zak Arntson"><img alt="Zak Arntson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/147/nVMQWQSYECWCV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson">Zak Arntson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150850/#Comment_150850" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T08:32:40+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  8:32AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://forums.gleemax.com/showpost.php?p=16114921&amp;postcount=11" rel="nofollow">Mike Mearls mentions there may be an issue with Skill Challenges as written.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150877/#Comment_150877" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T10:29:12+00:00" title="June 15, 2008 10:29AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://gloomforge.livejournal.com/12135.html" rel="nofollow">Keith Baker on Skill Challenges</a> (long)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150891/#Comment_150891" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T12:03:31+00:00" title="June 15, 2008 12:03PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2008 12:07PM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I've been reading all this stuff about skill challenges, right, and the biggest issue I have isn't the difficulty, but that everyone seems to be acting as if play goes like this: <i>freeform freeform skillcheck freeform BATTLEMAP freeform skillcheck freeform SKILLCHALLENGE freeform BATTLEMAP etc.</i><br/><br/>And I'm like, "So skill challenges and combats are these big set-piece things that interrupt the normal flow of freeform play, but skill checks just fit into whatever's going on?  What is this, 1985?  There's got to be a better way of integrating all this together"<br/><br/>If a skill challenge is just a series of skill checks, why does it matter whether you're current in a SKILLCHALLENGE or not?  Can't you just be like "I want to learn more about the Shadowfell Keep at the library."  And the GM can be like, "Make a history check.  Okay, so you learned useful fact X."  And another player can be like, "Great, I'm going to use useful fact X to pretend I already know all about the Keep and try to get more information out of the local lord."  And the GM can say, "Sweet, roll Diplomacy with a +2 advantage."  And then, hey, check it out, the players have now effectively creating a SKILLCHALLENGE by pursuing goals that are interesting to them and, when they reach a certain milestone in their investigation, the GM should probably give them some experience for this, either to the players directly involved in the investigation or to the entire group, depending on how your game rolls.<br/><br/>Similarly, this allows you to have SKILLCHALLENGES occur over lengthy periods of time.  Say the characters have a couple failures in their investigation.  Maybe the lord get suspicious of their sneaky dealings and has them kicked out of town.  However, when they get to the Keep itself, they continue poking around and uncover even more information.  Since this continues their early investigations, the SKILLCHALLENGE is back on again!  This also means failure does not cock-block you out of the experience or information you're trying to gather through investigation.  It just closes off certain avenues of investigation and adds complications, forcing the players to try other methods.<br/><br/>Basically, then, you've turned SKILLCHALLENGES into Keys (from The Shadow of Yesterday).  Both are non-combat avenues of gaining experience by pursuing goals over time.  And you've also reincorporated SKILLCHALLENGES back into the normal stream of play, instead of making them a whole different separate encounter, like combat.  I have nefarious plans to reincorporate combat as well, but the only solution I have so far -- mapping everything -- isn't very realistic or desirable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150923/#Comment_150923" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T16:59:11+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  4:59PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The DMG suggests you can run skill challenges like Jonathan describes: segmented across combat encounters, scenes, etc., each check contributing towards the entire challenge which may or may not take place across a large portion of time.

I'll get you next time, Mearls.  Next time.<br/><br/>P.S.  What I'm probably going to do it keep a running record of skill checks on a set of index cards, a different card for each overarching goal.  Then, if a significant milestone (XP) hasn't been reached by the end of the session, I'll hand unfinished ones to the players to write down on their sheets or keep with their Power Cards, so they can remember that they can continue them at any point in the future, as with Keys.

Your character just got into a fight with another character in the party?  Great!  You've now started progress on the "Everybody Hates Me!

As written, they're much more like what JW is talking about than "okay, we have to roll 5 times instead of once". They have structure, and are intended to incorporate changes in the fiction between rolls.<br/><br/>Most of the "this is so broken" upset seems to based on the assumption that each roll is independent of all others, which is very much NOT how I read the rules. There's still probably a slight issue with DCs, but I'm with Keith Baker - they clearly allow for non-win/lose stakes and gradations of success, so total victories SHOULD be darn rare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150946/#Comment_150946" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T20:58:34+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  8:58PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another problem is that a lot of people who are upset with skill challenges see them as walls that if you don't get past, the PCs are stuck, when they're supposed to drive the game play forward.  Failure in a skill challenge should drive things forward as much as success.<br/><br/>I'm starting to run a D&amp;D campaign very shortly and I'm definitely going to use the gradations of success.  And they'll all be run as Jonathan Walton (and the DMG) suggests.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>P.P.S.  Is it wrong to include non-skill accomplishments as progress towards a skill challenge?  Because I'm all over that like butter on toast.  Your character just got into a fight with another character in the party?  Great!  You've now started progress on the "Everybody Hates Me!  I Should Be Tempted By the Dark Side and Only Barely Not Turn Evil CHALLENGE" which is worth a bunch of XP.  Consider it a weird Key/Compel hybrid.  It's like a Key I'm giving you an incentive for taking on, but you can choose not to do it.

In fact, it's hidden within a lot of other stuff while Wizards is walking past it, whistling, "Nothing to see here!  Just D&amp;D as usual!"  In the case of Skill Challenges, they are clearly very cool once you actually start messing with all their hidden, unwritten implications, but the rules don't point out what makes them cool or how to enable them to be awesome at the table.  In fact, they give you a lot of examples and advice that is really pretty lame.  It's very much like, if this wasn't D&amp;D, it would be the king of all fantasy heartbreakers, because it comes really close to being totally awesome, but then backs away from awesome really fast, like it's scared of it.  My sense, increasingly, is that there was one person on the design team (and I guess we can take bets on who it was) who was really pushing this crazy stuff, but that it got heavily reined in, edited out, and watered down by people who didn't get it, were afraid the masses wouldn't dig it, or both.<br/><br/>So I guess it's up to us to draw lines between all the cool bits, playing connect the dots and assembling something that does really rock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150995/#Comment_150995" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T07:00:12+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  7:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>Keep in mind folks on this site are viewing 4th ed. from way across the room from where it came from.

And this is amplified, not just mitigated, by the various tactical &amp; fictionarial things that players can do to garner bonuses. So how should the text handle this?

How difficult should it be?  This will determine the DCs you set, etc.<br/><br/>2.  How big a deal should it be?  If it's a big deal, go with a higher complexity.  If it's not such a big deal, go with a low complexity (or even just a single skill check).<br/><br/>Of course, I haven't played it yet, but I should get my chance within the next few weeks.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151022/#Comment_151022" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T10:16:54+00:00" title="June 16, 2008 10:16AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is the "complex challenges are easier than simple challenges" idea just the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers" rel="nofollow">Law of Large Numbers</a>?

The complexity issue where it isn't hard just more import is a pretty valid this is not a bug but a feature thing, perhaps the problem is that xp is associated with challenge and not importance ( a carry over from the challenge based days of earlier dnd , not that we are that far from there now). But it still seems intuitively to me that higher challenge = more xp = more challenging is still kind of presumed in the text itself (on second thought perhaps not as explicitly as i thought to begin with but still there)<br/>\n<br/>\nLogos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151727/#Comment_151727" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T17:17:07+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  5:17PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreeing with Logos: Yeah, it's getting into stone soup territory, where sure, creative cooks adding creative ingrediants would make stone soup taste great.
