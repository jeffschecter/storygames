I don't want to ruin it; I don't want it to be about me. However, sometimes I can't help myself, because, obviously, it's great when people like my game, and I'm curious.<br/><br/>Sometimes when I talk about other people's games, I wonder what they would think. Sometimes I'd even like their feedback. But once or twice, I've had that feedback and... it just trumps everything. Suddenly, there's Canon, the Voice of the Designer, and everything else is silence.<br/><br/>Other times the designer just comments a little, and it's cool. Or they ask questions, and we have a conversation.<br/><br/>I think it has a lot to do with the reputation and status of the designer. Some people have become Important Voices and Community Leaders; other people are Enthusiastic Peers. I think it has to do with how you talk, how open and curious you are towards other things. I read the ideas of the Important Voices, but if I'm going to <i>talk</i> to a designer, I'd prefer she or he be more of a peer. That's just me, of course (I mean, I'm probably the only person in this community with authority issues.)<br/><br/>I once responded to someone's actual play of my game with tips about how they should have played it right. That was pretty stupid, and I hope I never do that again. If I can't suppress the urge to respond, these days I try just to post a short, appreciative whisper, or ask them to tell me more. <br/><br/>Because all I really want to say is "Hey! You played my game!!! How awesome is that?"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356880/#Comment_356880" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T05:39:54+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  5:39AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends on the designer. No, really. Some people can be civil, take criticism with aplomb, and still say thank you. Others? Not so much. <br/>If you can keep from telling me I'm doing it wrong (unless, of course, I really did miss handle something that is rules related.) If you can up my enthusiasm for the game, and try and energize play rather than stomp on it.Then by all means join in and tell me cool bits of what you did, and why. <br/><br/>Some designers can't simply say "Hey that's cool, go play it and see what happens if you do things that way!"  I try very hard to be the latter. Once I've written a game its for the play group to entertain themselves, if they find something they want to do differently--more power to them. Take it and mutilate it. It isn't something I'm going to get stressed about. I've read reviews that have apparently misunderstood how the rules work, in that case I'd like to correct it. Yet if someone chooses to handle the rules differently, and like it better? Who am I to stand in the way? Rock on with their bad selves!<br/><br/>My games are about going, and playing. Not what is set in paper in the book, but the total experience that people build from and to with what I've written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356887/#Comment_356887" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T05:59:48+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  5:59AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends on the designer and the goal of the discussion. <br/><br/>If the discussion is rule questions, I don't mind curt responses that end the discussion because... goal achieved!<br/><br/><b>What I don't like: </b><br/><br/>1. When the designer says, "you are playing wrong", but how to play right isn't explained in the game, or is explained in a confusing way. If different people repeatedly make the same mistakes... it's not the people. Or it is the people, but that's what instructions are for, to guide us away from making common mistakes. The rules may be good but if the instructions are bad, it doesn't matter. Instructions are more important than rules (and by extension, play aids are more important than rule books).<br/><br/>2. When the discussion is about rules hacking or setting theming, and the designer says, "that won't work", but doesn't say <b>why</b>. Many hacking/theming discussions aren't truly goal oriented. They are an outpouring of enthusiasm and expression of emotional engagement. Saying <b>no</b> kills that enthusiasm. Saying <b>why </b>redirects it.<br/><br/>That all said, I empathize with the designer. It's hard not to get involved. It's your baby, except it isn't anymore when we buy it, but it still feels that way. Also many designers aren't writers, so it can be frustrating to know your rules work but it's the text holding it back. And I can only imagine customer support is exhausting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356889/#Comment_356889" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T06:04:50+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  6:04AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's great when game creators join a thread to clarify or comment.

The designer is another enthusiastic fan of the game (hopefully) who (probably) has way more experience with it than I do. I'm always interested and excited to hear their opinions.

I try very hard to be the latter. Once I've written a game its for the play group to entertain themselves, if they find something they want to do differently--more power to them. Take it and mutilate it. It isn't something I'm going to get stressed about. I've read reviews that have apparently misunderstood how the rules work, in that case I'd like to correct it. Yet if someone chooses to handle the rules differently, and like it better? Who am I to stand in the way? Rock on with their bad selves!<br/></blockquote>\nReally, it's just a matter of respect.  When people talk about a game they are playing, it's <i>their game</i> that they are talking about, not the designer's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
