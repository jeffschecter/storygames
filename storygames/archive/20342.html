This was something of a problem, as we would need to delve into the dungeon multiple times to map it, identify our goal and extract it; going down below would be very dangerous if the base camp on the surface could be overrun by wild animals, outlaws or even barbarians from beyond the border while the party was down there.<br/><br/>The solution was ultimately to renovate the little guardpost-ish stone fort and man it with our own henchmen; as we were not expecting any <i>serious</i> concentrations of force, the stone walls, some new doors, and a few bows would suffice to keep the men inside the guardpost safe, without attracting undue attention from anybody. It took a fair share of our existing resource base to pull this off (all sorts of shenanigans with purchasing supplies and hiring men in what amounts to sparsely populated borderlands), but it paid off well later on, as the dungeoneering party could retreat from the dungeon even in critical situations, knowing that a safehouse was waiting almost at the top of the stairs. Ultimately the biggest problem with our clubhouse was the the local lord wanted us to contribute armsmen for road patrols, considering how our operation grew into a semi-permanent military installation in his back-country territories.<br/><br/>That's an example of a logistical challenge involving costs and labour and labour costs; the same campaign featured plenty of operational planning challenges (such as, how to locate and attack the lair of cunning outlaws) and social hacking challenges (e.g. how to develop a functional working relationship with primitive lair-dwellers who happen to control then entrance to the dungeon) as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448324/#Comment_448324" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-03T10:06:59+00:00" title="September  3, 2015 10:06AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            mmm ... ok ... but this kind of goes beyond the scope of what I was looking for.<br/>It is stuff that happened <b>outside</b> the dungeon, it is not strictly <b>dungeon delving</b> activity.<br/>It's a part of the preparation, like packing rations and getting hold of a map or at least local lore about the dungeon.<br/><br/>What I'm looking for are the obstacles you face <b>DURING</b> the delve.<br/>And at an "extreme" level at that... like... managing logistics when you DON'T have a safe retreat just outside the location, when you have to make do with whatever you have and can scavenge from the dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448334/#Comment_448334" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T01:43:11+00:00" title="September  4, 2015  1:43AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So later on in that same campaign, we got stuck down in the Stonehell dungeon for a couple of weeks. The issue was that this aborogine tribe we had been arming and making buddy-buddy with, who controlled the only stairway out of the dungeon, had a coup that turned them hostile to our interests. This occurred at a time when our party was down in the dungeon, and our first attempt at breaking the new leadership cadre failed, so we were obligated to retreat to the 2nd level of the dungeon to escape and regroup.<br/><br/>What followed was about two weeks of living off the land: we found a well in the kinda-sorta territory of some lizard people or some such, and experimented with eating some sort of sentient fungus or something like that (I forget what it was - some dungeon critter of unsavory nature) to stave off hunger. An old, abandoned shrine on the 2nd level became our hideout while we mapped the region to find a route to the 1st floor that wouldn't be blocked by either being smack in the middle of the aborogine territory we escaped, or in the crypts of a certain necromancer whom we didn't want to meet a second time. At the same time we attempted to maintain covert communications with the surface-friendly faction of the aborogines, on the principle that they might be able to help us out, or help us take out the new hostile leadership cadre.<br/><br/>That was one pretty memorable logistical challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448335/#Comment_448335" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T02:57:51+00:00" title="September  4, 2015  2:57AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really enjoy the larger-scale emergent challenges Eero describes, although you need a pretty robust long-term campaign scenario (and some continuity of action) to make such a thing playable - it won't work if you've got different players showing up at each session, for instance.<br/><br/>But insofar as smaller-scale things are concerned, I really enjoy the tactical intersection of armed opposition and an interesting environment. Fighting toe-to-toe with enemies is not the most exciting of propositions in a D&amp;D-style game (which is perhaps why I most enjoy the highly-deadly variants of that kind of game; it keeps things exciting), and exploring an unfamiliar environment can also sometimes fall into drudgery (the term "pixelbitching" comes to mind). So, by far, my favourite moments and challenges were when I (or the other players) had to consider various environmental features from a tactical perspective.<br/><br/>I remember, for instance, luring a group of small humanoids into a tunnel and then setting a fire-breathing monstrosity on them. (I was carrying a gemstone it was enchanted to seek at all times, so I threw it to them and then dove into the river, allowing it to carry me through to another cavern, while the monster torched them all with its deadly flames.<br/><br/>Those kinds of moments are very memorable for me; finding exciting and unusual environments and geographical features and then finding ways to take advantage of them so as to overcome opposition which would otherwise overpower the adventurers completely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448341/#Comment_448341" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T13:13:48+00:00" title="September  4, 2015  1:13PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are both very cool examples, thanks! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>A different question, this time about Dungeon geography.<br/>How important it is for you that every "room" makes ecological sense?<br/><br/>I mean, I remember dungeons, back in the old days, where you enter a castle in a England-looking realm, you explore a bit, and you find areas such as "<i>The Fire Cave</i>" next to a "<i>Deep Underground Lake</i>" next to a "<i>Room full of Kobolds</i>".<br/><br/>How much is this important?<br/>What do you consider good practices?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448346/#Comment_448346" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T15:07:38+00:00" title="September  4, 2015  3:07PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my favorite old school sessions, I was DMing AD&amp;D 2e for a party of 6-8 characters ranging 6th-12th level.<br/><br/>They come to a dead-end wall and immediately suspect a secret door, but don't find one. One of the characters whips out a True Sight ability and determines that end wall is magical. The paladin steps up and uses his Dispel Magic class ability to zap the wall. It promptly dumps a 10'x10'x10' volume of rot grubs on the party (previously held back by the wall). They had to scramble to deal with that.<br/><br/>Later on, they come to another dead-end wall, quickly whip out the True Sight and find a 10'x10' ceiling space that is magical. They stand well back this time and the wizard Disintegrates the magical ceiling, which opens up to an underground lake, flooding the entire dungeon with water. The easiest way is up (surface is 100' up). A couple of them have magic items or spells that let them breathe underwater. A couple have alternate means of locomotion to get up quickly. The rest all grab onto someone who can help. Then they see the dragon turtle.<br/><br/>No one died, but it was epic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448356/#Comment_448356" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T18:02:17+00:00" title="September  4, 2015  6:02PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the subject of "dungeons that make sense", I think it's a larger concern which can vary a great deal from game to game.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the game is about facing challenges and testing your luck, so anywhere on that spectrum is possible. Is using your real-world understanding part of the game? Can I, for instance, be a better adventurer if I realize that the kobolds in the dungeon don't have a source of water, and therefore I can defeat them by blocking the entrance for a few days?<br/><br/>Or is the bizarre and inexplicable nature of a typical "dungeon" (bizarre magical traps, creatures which don't make sense, weird phantasmagoric constructions) part of the fun of the genre for you?<br/><br/>It doesn't matter, and the game can work anywhere on that spectrum. Just be sure to communicate it well to everyone on the group so you're all on the same page.<br/><br/>Some groups ignore the "daytime" aspect of adventuring altogether, and just start the game with the party opening the door to the dungeon. They generally accept the possibly illogical or unrealistic nature of a dungeon as a set of challenges for the players. That's where the fun is.<br/><br/>I know that some people (Eero has talked about this, for instance) like to set their D&amp;D in a very carefully "realistic" historical Europe (say), and then use D&amp;D modules for the "underworld". Basically, the world makes sense... until the moment you step into a bizarre forgotten ruin. There, normal logic does not apply. (Since, after all, most of those modules have some pretty inexplicable stuff in them...)<br/><br/>You could even include an in-fiction rationale for this. Perhaps the dungeons are intrusions from another world, or some magical form of transportation is required to go there (which explains why they haven't all been looted already).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448368/#Comment_448368" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T23:13:51+00:00" title="September  4, 2015 11:13PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I appreciate internal consistency a lot because it makes the problem-solving more real; if the setting is whimsical and arbitrary, the players are reduced to relying on rules stuff as the only real and reliable thing in the game. I think this explains much about the prominence of e.g. magic item builds in earlier D&amp;D, and class builds later on.<br/><br/>I want to emphasize that this has nothing, per se, to do with high or low amounts of magic or the presence of complex magical ecosystems - the issue is standing behind your setting, whatever it is, not whether that setting is "realistic". If the scheme of the game involves e.g. fairy tale goblins with powerful craft magic that they use to create dungeons that defy sense, or dungeon ecosystems are subtly wrong to the daylight brain due to some malign magical influence swelling from underground, then you're already more than halfway to explaining how it is possible for that dragon to live in a room with doors too small for it to fit through. I very much think that the right approach to the bizarre aspects of dungeon design is to own it and acknowledge in-fiction that all this is, indeed, bizarre. When I'm GMing, NPCs will generally be much more shaken and annoyed by the illogic of the subterrain than PCs ever are, thus casting this stuff in its rightful context as eldritch material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
