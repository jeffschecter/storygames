I'm making progress with the hack I'm calling Dogs of the Inquisition which combined with the thresf title might let you know where my next field of inspiration was drawn from. I was deliberating over how to reward the acquisition of Corruption, Madness and Faith, specifically in terms of experience. It had been suggested to me another time that Dogs in the Vineyard would be a good game to run Dark Heresy with. I agree with that, but not the type of Dark Heresy game I want to run, which is much more simulationist and OSR. Still, the whole idea of the Dogs' Traits, Relationships &amp; Belongings and the ensuing Fallout inspired me. It has some resemblance to the original Dogs in the Vineyard, but not a significant one. To explain TRB to those unfamiliar with Dogs:<br/><br/>As part of creating your character, you choose a Background which gives you a certain number of Stats dice, Traits dice and Relationships dice, all separated. These are d4s to d12. You don't roll them, it's like Savage Worlds, you assign them and when they are called upon you roll. Stats are predefined things, the usual STR-CHA thing and you divide the Stats dice your Background gave you as you see fit (you can now forget Stats because they are not in my game). Traits are a combination of Skills and Traits from Burning Wheel, or Skills and random stuff you put into your "Character Description" box in OSR games. Relationships are not quite Circles, not quite Contacts, a word I'd best pick is "Connections", they don't have to be with people, they can be with more abstract things like "Sins", institutions and locations. Finally, there's Belongings, which are literally *things*, objects, guns, hats, walls. You don't get any dice for these, you can take as many as you want with a little guideline on how to attribute dice to them. Dogs in the Vineyard's conflict resolution system is a little hard to explain, but needless to say, when you get into a conflict, you check how many of your Stats, Traits, Relationships and Belongings apply and roll those dice, higher the better. After every conflict you have what's called "Fallout" where you determine how that encounter "changed you" and can advance your character. Or kill them. Of course, all of this is how the system works in Dogs in the Vineyard. <br/><br/><b>Traits, Relationships and Belongings in the Grim Darkness of the Far Future</b><br/><br/>In Dogs of the Inquisition, after you choose your Home World and Background (Background and Training Package respectively from SWN) you choose your Origin (Background from Dogs in the Vineyard). This gives you a number of dice to distribute, Savage Worlds style between Traits, Relationships and Belongings (something to note for later on, you get much fewer dice than in the original game*). I decided, apart from letting my players take "Your Coat" at 2d6 for free (as in the original rules) I'd restrict their Belongings. I'd keep the prerequisite that they must either have the Trait "I'm a Dog" or the Relationship "The Inquisition" and a new one that they had to have a "Sin" Relationship of their choice. I ran Character Creation the other and it went down well despite the fact that I was only giving an extremely vague explanation of why these would actually matter (because I haven't decided yet). These are my current thoughts about how this will actually function. By current thoughts, I mean floating, ephemeral, nebulous concepts vulnerable to radical and instant change.<br/><br/>*Added up in the fashion of basic addition, the Traits, Relationships and Belongings dice's percentage chance of success totaled 250 approx. on all of them.<br/><br/><b>In Play</b><br/><br/>When you are about to make a Skill Roll or an Attack Roll and you believe a Trait, Relationship or Belonging is relevant - not necessarily that it would aid you - to that action, roll the dice associated with that separately to your normal roll (only 1 TRB per roll). Each individual die is modified by your Ataraxia stat (connected to your Corruption, Madness and Faith). Regardless of success or failure on the main roll, if one die gets a result of 6 or higher, you gain an advantage in the situation which, to the discretion of the GM, may either give a connected action by an Ally a +1 modifier, or may eschew the need for a subsequent roll altogether. If one die gets a result of 1 or lower, you suffer a setback in the situation which, to the discretion of the GM, may either give a connected action by an Ally a -1 modifier, or may cause the need for an additional roll.<br/><br/>This is the most basic idea. I'd like to put this a little more in the hands of players a la Apocalypse World, give them different choices. I'd appreciate any suggestions of other options.<br/><br/><b><b>Fallout</b></b><br/><br/>At the end of each session, count up each of the TRB dice you rolled that resulted in an advantage. Separately, count up each of the TRB dice you rolled that either had no effect, or resulted in a disadvantage. Roll the first lot, then the second lot. Subtract the second lot from the total of the first lot. A low number means you get experience, your TRBs get advanced. A high number means your TRBs suffer temporary harm, higher means your TRBs suffer lasting harm. A very high number means that your character's fate is sealed. He is going to die. <br/><br/>This is all rough, if that wasn't obvious. My primary concern here is the amount of die rolls that are related to your characters gaining experience or not, especially if I'd like this to ultimately be a major, if not primary method of advancement. For that reason I'm trying to think of a way to reward experience as part of this method that is only slightly divergent from the rolls, or separate from them entirely and just based on what dice you ended up using. One more thing I'm thinking about is making Deliria (Madness), Malignancies (Corruption) and Fantasies (Faith) all just Traits to mechanise them in a simple way, but that's not really related!<br/><br/>As you can see, this is all very nebulous at the moment. In the very basic stages. But I'd like to roll out something workable with in at most three weeks, so I'm really looking for all the help I can get!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
