Not today, though, I've got deadlines I should be attending to. Feel free to start a thread if you're interested in some creative speculation, and I'll come in with my thoughts when I have the time.</blockquote>\nI've taken it on myself to mediate this discussion and get the ball rolling generally. A bit of context here: dotted around this forum and across the web our very own Eero has been describing his method of playing OSR D&amp;D which as been tentatively coined as "Primordial D&amp;D." This version of everyone's childhood favourite isn't so much a hack as a play-philosophy for the Dungeon Master heavily based on fictional positioning to resolve conflicts and a verbalised, ephemeral set of "rulings." Eero's writings are informative on a range of OSR subjects and make an enlightening read for anyone interested in D&amp;D.<br/><br/><i>[Currently away from my own computer with all the bookmarked threads/blog pages on the subject - if anyone has them that'd help.]</i><br/><br/>There are a few of us who'd like to encourage Eero to compile these separate texts into an easily accessible whole for the community. A .pdf or a dedicated webpage, even. There's some discussion that needs to take place about potential aims and content and so on.  <br/><br/>Hopefully this thread can get started with general questions/conjecture about what a potential project of this sort might include and Eero can drop some answers in when he gets the time, answering questions he finds edifying and ignoring those that miss the point like a benign lecturer of Ludology. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> <br/><br/>- Mike.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428539/#Comment_428539" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T03:23:13+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  3:23AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2014 3:23AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In some PD&amp;D discussions, it's been useful to reference the goals and ethos behind the specific techniques in question.  This leads me to wonder if a hierarchical or structural breakdown would be best.  For example, Apocalypse World's Agenda/Principles/Moves.  Would that be a good way to organize a description of the PD&amp;D play style?  I definitely see Agendas at one end, and a barrel of Stuff you Do When X Happens + Stuff You Do Whenever It Seems Productive at the other end.  At the in-between level, I think there's something like Principles, but different from AW's -- more about process and rulings and communicating these, and less about narration and aesthetics, perhaps?  Anyway, that's one model we could try.<br/><br/>Another approach could be to create a hierarchy of dependent procedures and achievements.  Top level: get on the same page about purpose of play; here's how.  Next level: having agreed on purpose of play, agree on general ethos for getting there; here's that ethos.  Next level: given that ethos, here's how we negotiate fictional matters of strategic interest in general.  Next level: given <i>that</i>, here's how we deal with entering combat (etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428541/#Comment_428541" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T03:48:01+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  3:48AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2014 4:01AM by Potemkin.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the first question is whether this text is a game-text with instructions for groups to run an OSR game in Eero's methodology or whether its a primer of sorts simply laying out alternative "best practice" kinda way of interpreting OSR texts. Could be both, of course, but we're busy bees here. Though I'd love to see some adventure modules being written (rewritten) to take into account the more verbal nature of a "primordial" game. \n<blockquote>between level, I think there's something like Principles, but different from AW's -- more about process and rulings and communicating these, and less about narration and aesthetics, perhaps? <br/></blockquote>\n"Positioning" perhaps?

I don't mind participating in forum discussions and such, as they're a much quicker thing, basically just a pastime. So any writing project isn't really going to be done by me, right now.<br/>2) I don't have anything against it if somebody else wants to write on the topic, or edit an anthology of D&amp;D theory, or whatever. I don't own ideas (nobody should, in my opinion), and there basically isn't a downside to it if you want to put together something coherent on this topic.<br/><br/>Predicated upon the above, I could see it as entirely realistic a pastime for anybody to whip together something like Matt Finch's quick primer to old school. I don't agree with everything Finch writes, theory-wise, but I am fond of the idea of a cheap, self-consistent little booklet that acts as an artistic program and technical model that people can reflect against when developing their own play practice.<br/><br/>Regarding David's question about pedagogical structure, I am myself fond of analytical modeling of the roleplaying process - probably too fond for most people. The way I usually teach my D&amp;D (when teaching it to prospective GMs and such, I mean - casual participation in play doesn't require that much theory, you just need to be willing to go with the flow until you figure out whether you enjoy this) relies on creative agenda first, technical strategy second, procedural approach third, practical hygienic principles of play as the fourth layer of instruction, and finally practical tradition of rules and rulings last. Here's what I mean by these topics:<br/><br/><b>Creative Agenda:</b> understanding and communicating with the group about the artistic goals of the enterprise. These goals, as I've described elsewhere, are best summed as tackling a compelling fantasy world, recognizing opportunity for adventure, identifying challenges involved, and then figuring out how these challenges may be resolved. The pay-off is the satisfaction of success or the bitter pathos of defeat brought about by the combination of clever decision-making and resolving the fictional events with flair. It's a real dynamic process in the sense that nobody's fudging, nobody's planning the outcome, everything's happening as just as real an interaction as in any boardgame, except that we have an infinite variety of moves available in all their subtle nuances thanks to the game being set in a shared imagined space instead of on a gameboard.<br/><br/><b>Technical strategy:</b> given that creative agenda, how do we go about construing of a roleplaying game to tackle it? The D&amp;D answer has certain cornerstone elements that I like to call strategic - not in the sense of in-play strategy, but rather in the sense of designing the game. These strategic cornerstones include basic things like setting management, the player/GM divide (why and how it exists), the party paradigm, the notion of "adventurer" as a thing the player characters are, the notion of even having a single player character, stable-based play, player-chosen campaign arc, sandboxing strategy, classes and levels, experience points as a measure of success, action simulation relying on saving rolls/armor class/hitpoints (without their mechanical details being considered yet at this level). There are probably some others as well, but you see what I mean: this big picture of what D&amp;D looks like, roughly, guides us in setting up the details.<br/><br/><b>Procedural approach:</b> after going through the technical strategy, I teach procedure: how to start a session, how to run character generation, how to discover and negotiate challenges, how to hexcrawl, how to map dungeons, how to pay for logistical expenses, how to handle encumbrance, how to develop procedures and introduce game mechanics as the game proceeds, all in accordance with the creative agenda and the basic technical strategy of the game.<br/><br/><b>Hygienic principles:</b> given the above we pretty much have a game. Not much detail yet, but we can loan something from the next step to illustrate this one. When I play D&amp;D I find that both the players and GM have a massive amount of formal freedom in how they act (in the sense that nobody else has a real veto on many things you do; if you really want to even after a discussion, you <i>can</i> do it), but not all actions are equally useful in maintaining the ethos and legitimacy of play. I <i>could</i> talk about game balance at this stage, but I prefer calling the best practices "hygienic", because I often construe of what we're attempting to do as a sort of polishing of our joint campaign into an ever-more accomplished piece of creative work, driven by the purity of the creative vision. "Unhygienic" practices are lazy habits brought in from other games with conflicting goals, while "hygienic" practices are consciously chosen ways of acting that generally help us stay within the design purview of the game. Very much like washing your hands regularly. This is practically the same theoretical order of thing as Apocalypse World MC'ing principles, and includes things like "maintain IC/OOC division" and "only exceptional NPCs get to have levels" and "roll dice openly" (not fudging is not a hygienic principle, it's already mandated by the creative agenda), and so on.<br/><br/><b>The mechanical tradition:</b> in practice I most likely end up drawing on this level of detail all the time while explaining the above, but analytically speaking everything else comes first, and the game mechanical rules and rulings can only be evaluated in the light of the above structural layers. I often just tell the interested parties to read a couple of D&amp;D game texts to see the similarities and differences. I might take up something like say the evolution of the saving throw mechanics, or how healing hitpoints works, as examples of the mechanical richness of the tradition. The important thing here is understanding that there is no direct flow of guaranteed bliss connecting any given game mechanic to that creative agenda at the top of the list; it's the procedure of adopting and adapting rules that keeps the campaign on target.<br/><br/>That breakdown could probably use some work (as always, I'm just streamlining thought directly onto the forum here), and I'm not that convinced that it's an useful way to think about this topic for others; I'm hella abstract as a thinker, so even if I construe of what I'm doing in rouhgly those terms myself (even when I'm not thinking about it explicitly in words), it's not a given that anybody else would feel themselves any smarter or better equipped with that sort of construct. Most people I meet want to just play D&amp;D instead of attempting to realize the Platonic principles of the universal game behind the immediate detail <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428549/#Comment_428549" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T08:28:26+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  8:28AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2014 8:44AM by Vernon R.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

Once you have those the specifics of what gets decided and how creates itself really.  You dont really need the individual moves if you know how to create them based on what's happening in the game and how the players can agree on that.<br/><br/>Edit:  Ha xposted with Eero.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428551/#Comment_428551" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T08:38:50+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  8:38AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Most people I meet want to just play D&amp;D instead of attempting to realize the Platonic principles of the universal game behind the immediate detail <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nIf we were "most people" we wouldn't be on this forum, guy.

It's a format that allows everybody to establish their own base assumptions, and focus on the things they find most interesting to talk about. It also emphasizes the richness of possibilities and the range of practice in the hobby instead of being massively dogmatic and didactic like I can just imagine a book written by myself to be.

My experience is that the actual "OSR people" (that is, people who self-identify as, or are widely identified as, OSR contributors) tend to be long-time D&amp;D gamers. Some have dropped old editions when the 3rd came up (or started playing other games altogether in the late '90s, almost always trad but sometimes Forgite indies) and then returned to their old ways, while others are genuine dinosaurs that've continued playing in their old ways all through the '90s and '00s. Relatively few, however, are old enough to have been gaming in the '70s or early '80s. Some certainly are, but a significant section of the vocal, experimental OSR folks started gaming in the late '80s. Most are a bit older than e.g. I am, but not much.<br/><br/>(Realistically speaking the biggest reason for why I'm so relatively non-exposed to D&amp;D is that I'm Finnish, and the rpg demographics here are quite different in some ways compared to the American field. In the early '90s when I started gaming the Finnish rpg scene was just blooming, and the division between our significantly Chaosium-fueled trad, simulationistic, GM-celebrating, plot-oriented ways and the red box D&amp;D tribe were pretty significant. My own impression is, and others have corroborated, that patches of the Finnish landscape at the time were conquered by either D&amp;D or the trad cluster of games, and it was quite common for a given gamer to never realize that the other sort of games were actually played to any degree. I for example never met an operating D&amp;D group before moving to Helsinki for my university studies, it was all about '80s trad gaming classics up in Upper Savo in my youth.)<br/><br/>As for how the age applies to things, I'd say that sometimes there are signs in the OSR discourse of geriatric authority plays - e.g. people insisting that they know better because they "were there", stuff like that. And then there are young people who sometimes cross the streams by bringing in ideas and content and attitudes from newer sources. I would not personally term these as serious branches of the phenomenon, but I've talked with some OSR people who do - even people who think that the "OSR" is actually just a subset of old school D&amp;D gaming nowadays, and that the more conservative wing of the scene isn't OSR at all, because being OSR is about returning to the game (as opposed to having played it all along), self-publishing, overturning the corporate TSR concerns, pushing D&amp;D away from corporate "D&amp;D fantasy" genre, and stuff like that. I'm not that convinced about this myself because to me it seems that the most dyed-in-the-wool "I only play authentic TSR modules" gamer is still basically doing the same stuff that somebody like e.g. Zak Smith (to pick an example of a youthful and experimental OSR guy who isn't afraid to mix rules systems and doesn't particularly mythologize TSR and put it on a pedestal) is. Could be that I'm just not close enough to it to understand the distinction.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest feature of the generational experience is that many people who were gaming in the '70s often emphasize the ahistorical or revisionist nature of the OSR - that it wasn't like that when they were gaming, at least in their immediate personal environment. This is something you mostly hear from people who aren't themselves participating in the OSR, naturally enough. I wouldn't term this a very interesting generational feature, though, as the vast majority of the interesting and productive OSR people don't seem to particularly <i>care</i> about whether their playstyle is authentic. This uncaring attitude is just fine with me, as I don't personally have a horse in the race when it comes to what roleplaying was like in the '70s - I'm a strict functionalist who researches the old ways to find fresh perspectives and ideas, not to seek some sort of legitimacy for what I'm doing now. And as I indicated, that's true in my experience of practically everybody actually playing old school D&amp;D nowadays. In this regard the myth that OSR is "about" historical legitimacy is sort of similar to the myth that the Forge is all about narrativist story games <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428591/#Comment_428591" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T18:42:34+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  6:42PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/><b><i>Samesies!!</i> </b> We should make up some <i>t-shirts</i>..!<br/><br/>But seriously, there's a commonality of experience here. <i>Weird.</i> Maybe you and I should talk about collaborating on some kind of anthology project?

Maybe I'm flattering myself (and my generational cohort) by saying "Oh, well, my experience is totally valid too" - even if my futureborn nature means I never participated in the original cultural milieu in which D&amp;D began. I like that though, gives me confidence to DM and to make players enthusiastic. <br/><br/>(I'm actually British. The trad gaming scene here was (and probably remains, the rise of M:tG notwithstanding,) dominated by Games Workshop and Warhammer products. It's through that early 90s, high-octane, metalapocalypse imagery that I got my first call to RPGs although it wouldn't be until University that I got inducted into 4e and have since been working my way back through the D&amp;D generations, chasing some dream-aesthetic/method of play that felt <i>right.</i> Tell you what, reading AD&amp;D after reading 3.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">0</span>e is a real eye-opener. <br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Ok, seeing as anyone who's made it this far down the thread probably has a pretty strong interest in the OSR and a potential primordial play-style I'm going to make you all an offer: I'm thinking of running a D&amp;D game online at least for a single session maybe more if we think it's going somewhere. I'll need to do some research as to what video tools/sites work best but I'd really like to get some <i>actual play</i> down so I got some hard data to draw on and hopefully generate some thoughts on play. <br/><br/>Would anyone be interested in something like this? <br/><br/>B/X D&amp;D would probably be my prime kick-off point if that's information you'd want to know going in? <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428612/#Comment_428612" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T05:36:27+00:00" title="February 22, 2014  5:36AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I could be up for this.

He's written more about his game than would fill a typical rulebook already, it's just matter of collecting the material and figuring out which bits need to go with which other bits.<br/><br/>Knowing Eero, I suspect he'll keep jumping in to clarify things, as well, as he has started doing in this thread.

I do have stuff ready to go at a moment's notice most of the time nowadays without doing anything special about it.<br/><br/>I haven't played over Hangouts or other voice calls, but I have played with text chat. I hear that VoIP is almost as quick as face to face tabletop play, while chat play is about half as fast - that is, you get half as much done per unit of time. Some of that is basically because you can do other things on the side, and it's generally less focused - not a problem as long as the players can handle it without e.g. forgetting that they're in a game while they're browsing forums or whatever on the side.

Can you explain a bit?</blockquote>\nPerhaps I should clarify: I don't consider my game any more or less hygienic than somebody else's as some sort of positive quality that my game possesses and somebody else's doesn't. (That wouldn't be a too pleasant attitude.) Rather, I've just been using the simile of "hygiene" to describe the modal status of certain types of of rules: there are rules - or principles - that guide your action in the game without being absolute constraints in the sense of subjective legal rights for any player to invoke. As these are not strict matters of right or wrong play, but rather helpful attitudes and guidelines for preserving an overall ethos, I find it more useful to call them "hygienic" to differentiate from socially mandated rules of interaction that game rules normally are. It's like "wash your hands regularly" is a hygienic rule instead of a moral principle by itself: regular washing helps you limit the transmission of undesired bacteria, which helps you in maintaining health, so although washing your hands per se is not laudable, and you're not obligated to do it for the sake of other people, the activity has incidental consequences in maintaining health, and is thus desirable for its utility outcome. In a similar way there are many things that I do when refereeing D&amp;D that are not strictly speaking mandatory, but that I find very useful in maintaining the proper ethos of the game.<br/><br/>An example of this type of "hygienic" rule is the idea that the referee should not design for outcome, nor have an outcome in mind when prepping game material. I have often called it "unhygienic" for a GM in this type of game to approach analyzing game material from the viewpoint of how their players would react to it, or what the likely mathematical outcome of e.g. some combat would be. While such a mental attitude alone is merely thinking in your own head, and thus not immediately part of the game, it is easier for the referee to be impartial in action if they are impartial in thought, and it is easier to be impartial in thought if you <i>don't</i> analyze your game prep in a teleological way to begin with. In this way a GM who e.g. designs content for balance is engaging in an "unhygienic" practice, as their own commitment to balance is making it naturally easier for them to accidentally or out of ignorance break their obligation to be unbiased and fair. As long as they are actually still being fair in refereeing they have not broken a formal obligation in traditional sense of the concept of a "rule", so I can't say that designing for balance is forbidden by the rules - it is not. It's just that I have my doubts about the mental hygiene of mixing roles like that. Thus it would be more hygienic to remove even the temptation of manipulating the outcomes by abandoning the entire habit of pre-envisioning what will happen in play; the hygienic way to approach game prep is thus to just set things out as they should and would be, without concern for what players might or might not do; for all you know they'll decide to turn back after the first room, you're in no position to day-dream about what the players will or won't do in play.<br/><br/>An example of a similar hygienic rule for players is the IC/OOC divide: it is not technically speaking breaking any interactive rules of our mutual pastime for you to opportunistically utilize meta-knowledge to sidestep challenges wherever you can, but it <i>is</i> a bad habit that might at some point cause you to play less well than you would have if you'd gotten into a rigorous habit of deducing from in-character knowledge instead of trying to "cheat" all the time. Of course the GM will do their best to constrain information and give the players a roughly matching IC/OOC field, and of course it won't matter most of the time, but when it does matter, the player whose practices are more hygienic is likely to find it easier and more fun to play with flair despite knowing something important that their character doesn't.<br/><br/>A huge amount of the substantial support structures of my play are hygienic in this way, rather than being rules in the traditional sense. Any things that we consistently do, that we might as well do a different way if we thought it'd be better, could well be hygienic. An innocuous and central example of something that might be mistakenly considered a "rule" when it is in fact a hygienic principle is my insistence on 3d6 in order when rolling ability arrays: this is a hygienic principle in the sense that by rigorously denying any and all ability manipulation in chargen I pre-empt the player tendency to feel entitled to have a certain ability set, and I pre-empt the GM tendency to develop rules that rely on having certain ability sets. Nothing in the game would exactly break if we allowed you to swap two abilities or let players roll 4d6 or assign points, not immediately; however, if I relaxed the random nature of ability arrays, that would encourage me to adopt lazy rules solutions that rely on PCs having certain ability scores, which could cascade over the long term into broken system design a la TSR. By closing the door at an early stage of the process I make it easier for us to maintain the desired mechanical environment.<br/><br/>In case the above seems insensible, perhaps a comparison to a different game would be helpful: the <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> relies on its own set of hygienic principles, as it also depends on the fluid development of new game mechanics piece-meal, and defining a set of principles and limitations to constrain otherwise unconstrainable constitutional authority is basically the only way to prevent the Story Guide from lopping their fingers off with the bandsaw. For an example of such a hygienic principle in TSoY, consider that TSoY NPCs cannot have any higher Ability ratings than PCs, and there are no ways to add static modifiers to Ability checks (outside the old equipment rules, if you use them), which means that the mathematical likelyhood of any given character winning an Ability check against another one is always strictly limited to a certain band of possibilities. You could break either of these principles when creating new Secrets, technically speaking, merely by deciding to do so - just decide that this Secret gives you a +1 to your Ability check result in certain situations, or whatever. However, the dice math of the game would break very easily if you allowed characters to get Ability values beyond the 0-4 scale the game uses, so while it is technically possible to introduce such, and there is no formal rule disallowing it (TSoY for better or worse does not have a set of meta-rules limiting the nature of the new rules you invent), it is still a good hygienic principle to never allow Ability values to be modified by Secrets - rather use bonus dice, that's what they're for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428764/#Comment_428764" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T07:40:10+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  7:40AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I might make a suggestion, you might want to use the expression "best practice" or something like that instead of "hygiene."

I would find it a misunderstanding to say that we've been rocking adventure modules because of laziness or inability to create our own stuff, or hygienic concerns; the original inspiration was that I simply wanted to try some of this new OSR stuff out, and that hasn't really changed.<br/><br/>I've done three full-blown D&amp;D campaigns in my life, and two were fully original material (neither had any major issues with impartiality, either, largely because I'd already had my road to Damascus moment with the Forge before the first one). The next one will probably be original as well, at least to a higher percentage than the one we're doing now. Probably will continue using suitable modules as well, though, as I very much subscribe to the Jim Raggi doctrine on the effect of modules on your GMing: by utilizing a variety of materials you force yourself to extend and vary your style in ways that wouldn't happen if you created everything yourself, which improves your play over the long term.<br/><br/>Of course using ready-made stuff is helpful if you don't feel the inspiration for making your own, or lack the experience, or whatnot. For my own part I feel like I've got the attitude down pretty well, though; when I write adventure stuff I think in terms of potential challenge, without interpreting that through the lens of my own preconceptions about the nature of the campaign and the party. The scenario is what it is, perhaps faithful to its setting, but unconstrained by preconceptions about the party that would be run through it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428773/#Comment_428773" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T09:13:00+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  9:13AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2014 9:14AM by Potemkin.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>when I write adventure stuff I think in terms of potential challenge, without interpreting that through the lens of my own preconceptions about the nature of the campaign and the party.

But how do you conceive of and then build a potential challenge without imagining a desirable outcome for campaign/party? Let's say I'm building my dungeon and I want to have the classic trapped statue with gemstone eyes - the desirable end-point here is that the party overcome the trap and get the reward, right? It's hard to think about designing the trap without having that possible end-point in mind (the alternative ends - that the party activate the trap and get no reward, or that they ignore/refuse the trap altogether - are also present). Is it just a case of being ambivalent about the result of the trap's inclusion? Like, getting all Tao of the Dungeon?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428778/#Comment_428778" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T10:00:48+00:00" title="February 25, 2014 10:00AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I do it (and there could be other ways for certain) is that I let my curiousity about world-building, literary elements and tactical challenges lead me. Any one of those could be a primary concern in writing up the material. None of them are teleological in the sense that I would need to device the material in terms of outcomes I desire or fear in actual play.<br/><br/>For example, a while back I developed a small one-shot adventure for our campaign as a change of pace, to let the GM have a chance to play for a change. My chosen subject matter was (among other things, these things tend to branch away from me a bit) the <i>Solomonari</i>, a quasi-historical sect of magicians in Dacian lands (Rumania, that is to say). The hook of the adventure was a kidnapping: a Solomonari magician had taken a child to raise him into the magical tradition, and the father, being the local <i>\u017eupan</i> (count), had the means to reward the boy's safe return.<br/><br/>Now, a teleological scenario writer would ask himself, what would be likely to happen when the adventurers face the magician. What do I want to highlight for them in this experience? How do I prepare for the way the events might go? Should I add or reduce the level of challenge to make this a suitably challenging encounter? How do I ensure that the players do face this magician at all, so as to have my cunning plot occur as predicted?<br/><br/>Not so with me. I determined that the magician is mechanically a 3rd level Elf (the class has to do with his somewhat peculiar background, not relevant here) because that's an appropriate level for the demographics of the setting; he has a guardian leucrotta at his Solomonarian cave, because that's the sort of shit the Solomonari play with (they're sort of like arcane druids, if I had to define them in Gygaxian D&amp;D terms); he has a couple of magic items of fae persuasion, one just for the heck of it (read: due to my literary inspiration, and sense that I need slightly more content in the scenario) and one specifically related to his escape strategy after the kidnapping; he has specific motivations that may not be inimical to those of any adventurers who find him, for his is a somewhat righteous cause, and he can afford to bribe the party with one of those magic items. He tarries for what, something like 2d6 days at most at a nearby Solomonari cave due to a hitch in horse-thievery plans, but should the adventurers not find their way there, he'll escape with the boy (or without; the boy himself in this scenario is a complicating factor all his own).<br/><br/>Note that none of the above impulses about this NPC involved in the scenario concerns outcomes of the scenario, it's all about a) what makes sense in the setting (him being mechanically a 3rd level Elf), b) what entices me literarily (a leucrotta and a couple of magic items I created for Eastern European folklore atmosphere), and c) what would be tactically interesting (not only a magic-using opponent, but one that could potentially be engaged diplomatically, but who also has a time-line of his own that he's following). Specifically, at no point did I benchmark my Solomonarius against the means or motivations of the party that might or might not encounter him in play.<br/><br/>Applying this same attitude to your example of a trapped statue with gemstone eyes, it seems like a pretty straightforward case: does it make sense for there to be a trapped statue here, <i>should</i> there be one for this to be a literarily compelling abandoned temple (or whatever it is where the statue resides), is it challengeful content to have such a statue? Any of these are reason enough to have that statue. Meanwhile, the fact that the players like statues, or the party doesn't have a Thief and they need to be punished for it, or there's not enough treasure in this adventure location, or these gems need to be guarded somehow or they're too easy pickings - none of these outcome-based concerns are hygienic reasons for placing a trapped statue, to my way of thinking. To be pure, the scenario material needs to stand because it's true, not because it has to conform to the concerns of the character development rat race.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428779/#Comment_428779" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T10:34:48+00:00" title="February 25, 2014 10:34AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just sort of computing this at the moment but here are some sketches of ideas I'm having:<br/><br/>It's kind of like you've internalised the way the rules-as-written express themselves to express new content. The way you describe the scenario with the <i>Solomonari</i> (<i>freekin cool!</i>) is the way a published module would put it, firmly grounded in the established procedural nature of D&amp;D play where even time (the 2d6 days the elf lingers in the cave) has a measurable pace (a later game might let the DM speed up time so the battle with the <i>Solomonari</i> happens at sunset for dramatic effect, but not so in the primordial soup!). <br/>Does expressing the events in play in the same manner as "the rulebook" bestow some quality of impartiality on you as a DM? Or am I barking up the wrong tree?<br/><br/>The trapped statue is tricky thing to think through, especially because of its place as a classic D&amp;D element, which lends it an air of "meta." Or perhaps D&amp;D can be its own literary reference and we don't have to worry about getting into post-modernity?<br/>But anyway, I'd say that I would only consider the statue if it was appropriate for it to be there (although if you can think of an environment in D&amp;D that couldn't support an ancient statue or two, I'm all ears) and that it would be compelling content - those are the only circumstances I wouldn't immediately dismiss the idea before even putting pencil to paper. So maybe I'm some kind of OSR savant, or maybe I've got enough experience as a DM not to include incongruous or dull elements? <br/><br/>If the above is a little wishy-washy, I apologise.

I say this because people with a lot of D&amp;D experience seem to often have this somewhat surprising attitude that modules are an artificial construct that are the way they are simply because you can't put a real GM between book covers. Well, I have no D&amp;D background going back to my misty teenage years in the old country, so I might just be sorely mistaken, but in my eyes old school D&amp;D is about the only game I've seen where the concept of an adventure module <i>really</i> works: they're written in exactly the way that has utility for running the type of game they're for, and using them brings a lot of extra value to the game in terms of work saved, variety in material, and higher objectivity of the prep. From my viewpoint this shunning of the adventure module often seems like it's because people have moved on in terms of creative agenda and GMing philosophy, and for this reason they're rebelling against the methodology that these old module-writing formats presuppose and execute so well.<br/><br/>I guess I could show you some of my adventure notes; I write those in English despite our gaming mostly being in Finnish. I think you'd find that the notes aren't that interesting, though, as they're fundamentally like a published adventure, except lacking in editorial polish, often being in confusing order, and often leaving some bits for general campaign procedure, known reference works or memory to handle. (Like for instance, I didn't write down a stat block for a leucrotta in that adventure, because the entire joke about putting it in there was because I'd been reading the AD&amp;D monster manual recently, and had that at hand when I executed the adventure.) Get any hygienic adventure product out there (that is, one that doesn't rely on plotting or setpiece encounters), and it'll look pretty much the same.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that this is about merely duplicating game texts, but rather about the game texts being rather successful about communicating what kind of prep is necessary and desirable for the type of wargame referee that D&amp;D desires as a game. It's totally the sort of game where you don't commit that cardinal sin you suggest, the "setpiece" encounter, as I like to call it - in the game I play you let the players miss your supposed fucking climax encounter, because <b>you shouldn't have had an assigned climax encounter in the first place</b>!

Sure, it won't ruin your game. But it sets a precedent for the game to drift in a different direction: why are we adjusting the timeline, and why are we concerned with dramatic poignancy? Those are not in line with our creative agenda.<br/><br/>I think that in this playstyle that would best be handled as a mutual group decision. "Hey, if it makes no difference to you strategically, what if we say that you get there at sunset, just for the cool visuals?" "Sure, why not, it'll give us some descriptive visual flair if we want that."

The entire game just started to make more sense when I figured out how differently it runs when you remove the modern GM figure and substitute a wargame referee.<br/><br/>Anyway, regarding setpieces, what you describe might or might not be legitimate, depending on the local logistical procedure. For example, if the campaign consistently tracks time of day in these types of situations, the GM does not have the authority to override the tracking the players do. Likewise the GM would be breaking faith if he manipulated the time of day for the sake of manipulating encounter outcome. If neither of these or some similar concern is in effect, then there's free room for narrative flourish in there.<br/><br/>I would personally be unlikely to go for that particular narrative flourish simply because tracking time and such logistics is so ingrained in the local habits. Of course I have on occasion free reign to determine the time of day, but if I said that it's e.g. right at sunset as the party reaches the adventure location, I might very well get an immediate veto and backtrack in the face: "If it's <i>that</i> far out, then obviously we won't be trying to reach the place today - we'll seek for a camping position two hours before sunset, and establish secure perimeter, continuing in the morning." So where's my planned dramatic sunset now <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>That's not to say that dramatic flourishes don't occur, it's just a really, really emergent phenomenon when you genuinely don't plan for what the players are going to do. The ideal for dramatic flourish in my refereeing style is that it's something that occurs to somebody (doesn't need to be the GM) at the spur of the moment, when we see how the setup and the choices cascade, and the dice fall; that's when you throw out some memorable poetics, and they're all necessarily improvised on the spot, as you see the fiction in your head right then. That authenticity is actually procedurally entirely significant to my mind, as that internal eye's view of the fiction is the authoritative viewpoint: it is not unknown for even GM prep to get over-ridden by that immediate shared imagined space, as it happens to get established in play.<br/><br/>All that being said, I have to say that just last December we got this exact narrative flourish of a battle against the setting sun at a cavern entrance in our game <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> It just happened legitimately in the sense that it wasn't something the GM would've maneuvered for. Somebody just noticed that it was just before dark that we'd found our target, and as we were under a tight time-limit, we ended up attacking in this exact lightning condition, which resulted in some nice imagery.\n<blockquote>Would you be so kind as to post them here? I think I speak for everyone following this thread in saying "Yes please!"</blockquote>\nSeems like I still have this Solomonari stuff in Dropbox from when we played it, <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9536425/The%20Balanest%20Family%20Curse.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I should note that when I say that it's personal notes, I mean it - there's some of campaign-specific, genre-specific, school-specific shorthand in there, so chances are that if something doesn't make sense it's because of that. Also, despite being sort of laid out, that's just one evening's prep work, basically stream of thought, so it's not internally as cohesive as the layout might make it seem. (The reason that it's laid out at all is of course that I'm sort of in the business - just as easy to write into a ready-made layout scheme as it'd be to write into some more conventional software. In this case I just pushed the text into the layout I used in last year's OPD contest.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Writing up Eero's Primordial D&amp;D - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Writing up Eero's Primordial D&amp;amp;D - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I think this is precisely what Eero was talking about when describing &quot;non-hygienic practices&quot;.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think this is precisely what Eero was talking about when describing "non-hygienic practices". Sure, it won't ruin your game. But it sets a precedent for the game to drift in a different direction: why are we adjusting the timeline, and why are we concerned with dramatic poignancy? Those are not in line with our creative agenda.<br/><br/>I think that in this playstyle that would best be handled as a mutual group decision. "Hey, if it makes no difference to you strategically, what if we say that you get there at sunset, just for the cool visuals?" "Sure, why not, it'll give us some descriptive visual flair if we want that." It's not the GM's purview, however, to make this kind of decision on her own.</blockquote>\nThat's very well said, on both counts - this is indeed a best practices issue in that a GM who feels the compulsion to micro-manage something like this is probably paying attention to the wrong things at a significant moment. I consider it a proper aesthetic impulse if the GM has it at the time, in the moment, as reaction to what he observes to be the facts, but if it's something he's planning for in advance, then it's a hygienic problem that the GM is planning this kind of content in advance, when the only way he could truly enforce it in play is by railroading.<br/><br/>And as you say, this sort of stuff is totally doable communally. For example, one might make a quick gentleman's agreement with the players about the "challenge not being there", as I often like to say: you state something, draw the players' attention to the fact that you don't strictly speaking have authority for determining that unilaterally, but promise them that it's not an important detail. Assuming that they trust in your creative relationship, they'll let you mess about however you want as long as it's not tactically important. So if you really want that sunset, you can just ask the players whether, implicitly or explicitly, to play along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428787/#Comment_428787" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T12:32:18+00:00" title="February 25, 2014 12:32PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If I might make a suggestion, you might want to use the expression "best practice" or something like that instead of "hygiene."

I hope this suggestion is welcome, for whatever it's worth, because I'm interested in your project.</blockquote>\nIn contrast, I like "hygienic", at least when it's used to refer to things that can corrupt your game (e.g. letting a setpiece climax encounter slip into your session prep).

I prep differently, since I don't use modules, and generally I follow one of these two techniques.<br/><br/>1. In the Dungeon. Just set it and forget it. For this space, you can follow two paths: to design things piecemeal and accept that you won't know how they fit together until it happens is the easiest. The big advantage of a megadungeon here is that you can trust that someone is eventually going to trigger your trap\u2014so you don't have to plan for it to happen to any particular people any particular way. It can sit for a year before someone stumbles into the room. And you will be so pleasantly surprised to remember all the stuff you put in there when it happens.<br/><br/>Of course for your dungeon you are going to want to have some more complicated interlocking parts. Things that are designed to go together. My hygenic practice here is that, if I am imagining possible outcomes, to imagine at least two very different ones and to make sure that the pieces are there to make them both really awesome. Then throw in a few of the type a components around them and you will be almost guaranteed to get something that you didn't plan for.<br/><br/>2. Outside the dungeon my campaign is really driven by player initiative. They keep coming up with things they want to do that push the borders of the sandbox. This is good. But it means that they themselves are in charge of framing the encounters. I dangle some ideas in front of them and they chose how to pursue. If you want the sunset behind your battle, the only way you can make that happen is to appeal to their aesthetics or to make it somehow matter\u2014which is easy enough to be honest. I'm pretty sure they won't be approaching the terrible forest castle in their region anytime except right before dawn because someone told them that that's when the witch is vulnerable. Give them the tools to set up the situation and trust their judgements instead of using your own.<br/><br/>Once you've done that setup, you can go back to type 1. In the castle I have imagined a negotiation that could happen, I have imagined a single combat with the party's high level fighter, I have imagined an all-out battle on the field. I also know that there is a list of other weird stuff, like that alleged dawn vulnerability, special qualities of the inhabitants, and most of all the players' own ingenuity and resources (like, I certainly didn't remember that one of them has armour that lets them levitate whenever they want but sure enough...). So I can trust that some exciting, unexpected things will happen even in a situation that has been foreshadowed for weeks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428791/#Comment_428791" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T13:22:13+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  1:22PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's all good advice, Adam.

If initially the set up is the challenge of getting treasure from lair beasts, and later the challenge evolves to a point where the XP can meaningfully be awarded for some other kind of challenge, you're still well within the bounds of the agenda. <br/><br/>That doesn't mean you don't discuss it, but it's not necessarily a big deal. It's the same issue as providing the kind of content that the players will find fun. In the same way that you might introduce an urban adventure into an OSR game that has previously been about dungeons, with or without discussion with the group, based on the players, I think you could introduce new sources of XP. (Of course, XP by its nature is a *goal*, so if you introduce new sources of XP you need to let them know at the point of deciding whether to go for the challenge, not just when it's awarded).<br/><br/>The hygienic concern here is that the new XP source be something the GM will not be tempted to bias. For example, quest XP might be a good thing - it's within the rules - but it might be unhygienic, if the GM can't set it impartially, and with a fictional basis, the way he or she can with the treasure XP. But so long as the new XP source is something like that - e.g. XP per hex explored, per portal closed - then it's not a big concern.<br/><br/>(I'm trying to practice thinking about these questions, and articulating answers. I may be entirely wrong, and am happy to be corrected by Eero and others).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428824/#Comment_428824" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T07:02:58+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  7:02AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess that Eero mentioning possibly adding other sorts of XPs was simply notable to me, because it seems like a drift situation that may impact his fairly clear vision of what his <i>Eero's Extremist D&amp;D</i> is all about.<br/><br/>Right now, it seems to be about Adventurous Adventurers-Explorers-Looters-Armed Archaeologists planning expeditions to rumored lost places and getting back alive and tougher for it.<br/><br/>And I also thought his character-retirement procedures were interesting in that regard. When a character has resolved the fictional reasons for being that sort of adventurer have been resolved, the player either retires the character or the player creates new reasons to continue on with that lifestyle. For example, if a PC went on an adventure, gained enough loot to open that pub they've always wanted, well, off they go into retirement!<br/><br/>Thing is, I could see alternate sources of XPs rapidly inviting drift away from the core hygienic concept. Some of them possibly not such a big deal. XPs for making a map that they then sell ( or really just get the XPs for the sale effectively).<br/><br/>Drift is odd. It happens, but it can really change the whole point of something. On a strange tangent, I was watching a thread talking about the game Monopoly and how it radically drifts into something else in an unhygienic fashion ( and often unpleasant fashion) when certain rules are dropped or the common house rules of placing money under Free Parking is added. Doing that causes Monopoly to go from a fairly straight forward, short playtime, competitive game to something more like a long activity mostly about collecting property and building buildings for the sake of building buildings, perhaps with the actual goal of using all of the available building toys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428827/#Comment_428827" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T07:24:58+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  7:24AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Having looked through your notes a little, Eero, is it generally the case that you'll write up similar for all the general areas the players might explore?

Random encounter tables and such, completely ordinary OSR technique. Then on occasion I will also use specifically created overland scenarios as part of this process; commercial examples are a bit few, but <i>Better Than Any Man</i> is a good example of what I mean here. I can of course create my own, as this quick sketch of a Romanian <i>\u017eupan</i>, devoid of much in the way of geographic spec, shows.<br/><br/>In general I'd say that you don't want to do overland, sandbox-y adventuring completely without prep, but depending on the skills and local play culture you might need more or less, or different types of prep. I'm pretty good at this point with a surprisingly little in the way of random encounter tables, for example, due to my having practiced alternative random generation methodologies that don't require tables at hand <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote>If I understand correctly, part of maintaining hygienic play is an awareness in the whole group of what the core concept and activity of play is exactly.<br/><br/>Another big part is watching out for Drift, and putting a stop to drift that is too far away from the central concepts/activities of play.</blockquote>\nThat's an interesting point, about the relationship of drift in the Forgite sense to this concept of "hygiene". My first reaction would be to consider them as somewhat different orders of thing, but thinking about it carefully, it does seem like avoiding drift is sort of one of the motivations behind maintaining rigorous hygiene. We maintain hygiene - or, equivalently, wield available authorities conservatively, in proven reliable ways - in an effort to prevent the game from developing wrong habits that encourage wrongful action. If the group consensus wants to drift the game, then hygiene will ultimately avail to nothing, but I'm sure that a generally hygienic practice will make minor drift more difficult.\n<blockquote>For example, I noticed Eero talked about the retirement of characters. The retirements occurred when their fictional motivations no longer aligned with the core concepts/activities of play. So this is a procedure put in place to maintain the hygiene of the game, correct?</blockquote>\nRetirement is partially hygienic as a concept, yes: the hygienic part is that by requiring characters to have solid reasons for adventuring we prevent the game from slipping into a situation where the referee is responsible for inventing false motivation, and we ensure that the characters remain balanced against the setting; characters who are strong enough to not need to be desperate adventurers anymore quite being such, instead of continuing as weird one-man armies. In this way the concept of character retirement serves to regulate the xp economy and direction of adventuring, in relationship to whatever directions the players desire for their game.<br/><br/>(The reason for why I call retirement a hygienic concept only in part is that it is <i>also</i> a satisfying fictional conceit, and part of the game's genuine reward system; there's nothing quite like realizing that your character has achieved what he set out to do, and may now have his epilogue - stop adventuring, invest your wealth in something sensible, play dollhouse to whatever degree you find amusing, and perhaps start up a new character if you feel like it. When D&amp;D lost this notion in favour of endless adventuring, or adventuring until the level cap, I think it lost not only an important regulatory element, but also an important reward system.)\n<blockquote>When and how do you look at certain kinds of drift and decide it is reaching the bounds of the core concepts of play? Do you decide as a group, does the GM decide but then gain the approval of the other players to support the decision? Something else entirely?</blockquote>\nWhat I personally do with drift is that when I realize that it's happening or happened, I attempt to determine what the group's interests are about it. Sometimes drift happens because we wanted it to, in which case we well might simply acknowledge it afterwards. For example, our current D&amp;D has sort of arrived where it is in certain aspects of its creative concord by drifting: we did not know when we started the current campaign how e.g. creative authority would be divided between players, and where the balance between realism and victory would be set in terms of motivation. Only afterwards we could smile at each other in satisfaction and declare ourselves just about the best D&amp;D crew ever.<br/><br/>Sometimes drift happens due to ignorance and old habits, and it's actually not desired. I'd say that my method in combating this mainly consists of giving inspirational speeches <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> For example, we occasionally have players who like to argue from the rulebook (as authority instead of precedent, I mean), which doesn't work too well in this game; one might look at this as a sort of agenda drift. I try to be conscious of such matters and notice them, so I can bring the discussion to the meta level instead of having to listen to boring low-quality rules-lawyering <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>In general, though, I don't think that creative discord can be handled in any except one way in roleplaying games: you have to come to a creative agreement with the group to continue playing together. Sometimes that agreement can be live and let live, for minor enough differences, while other times you have to talk it out and either reach a compromise, or stop playing together.\n<blockquote>I think I also recall Eero talking about non-treasure XPs/non-monster killing XPs. If this is enacted, it's a kind of drift. At what point would some kind of hygiene-maintaining procedure need to be put in place?</blockquote>\nMartin answered this <i>exactly</i> the way I would: the hygienic issue about alternative xp systems is not in the fact that they are alternative, but rather in maintaining sharp goal-orientation and calculability of the experience points. I often say that the xp reward mechanism is in two parts, and you can't actually understand what it's doing without realizing that: the first part is the trigger ("We got treasure, thus we succeeded"), and the second part is the <i>quantification</i>, which answers how much xp should be collected. My personal understanding of D&amp;D is happy as long as the trigger is clearly goal-oriented, and the quantification is doable, somehow objective so that it's not just arbitrary.<br/><br/>For example, general quest experience rules are actually relatively tricky to write because of the quantification part. It's not that difficult to determine whether a quest has in fact been accomplished (we've long held that if nothing else helps in this regard, then at least we can write down the quests as they are undertaken, and use this written scrip as proof of the fact that a given deed was, in fact, an intentional quest and not just some random occurrence), but quantification of how much xp should be received for it, that's actually not so obvious. I have some thoughts, but I've never had the time/inspiration for really hammering it out to my satisfaction yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428828/#Comment_428828" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T07:31:33+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  7:31AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing about drift here is that I don't think that a changing fictional focus for a D&amp;D campaign is creative drift when your conception of the game is as let's say powerful and uninhibited as it is with me. I could see how a player whose character really wants to be a pirate would be a disruptive force in a campaign that really only wants to go into dungeons, but that's not the case in my sandbox, where the entire arc of play is more about discussing a bigger, much bigger issue: how does an adventurer become a heroic success in a world inimical to his purposes? When the society resists attempts at social climbing, and the very physics of the world are set against easy heroic narratives, how do you succeed despite all odds?<br/><br/>When that's your subject matter, it's not much of a drift for the party to decide one day that they're going to invest everything they've dragged out of old temples and musty dungeons, and buy themselves say a galleon with which to start engaging in triangle trade over the Atlantic. This is certainly a big enough shift in subject matter that it should be talked over with the referee (he needs to be ready and willing to prep entirely new types of content), but it's not <i>creative drift</i>. The creative rules are quite clear: either we follow the character onto his new adventures, or if we deem them non-interesting, we let the character retire into his new adventures. There's no drift where we follow the character's new maritime inspiration, but refuse to turn that into challengeful adventures, and somehow end up playing Monopoly when we tried to play D&amp;D; it's the same game, whether set in a dungeon or a deserted island.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428829/#Comment_428829" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T07:37:47+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  7:37AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to talk about quest XPs, but unfortunately, I have to run to work right now.<br/><br/>One thing I'd been considering for similar things was looking at the XP + treasure charts in the books, then using that to determine XPs, even if the actual treasure isn't given out.<br/><br/>Essentially, if the players rescue the 3HD/12 HP Princess as a quest, the XPs are for what defeating a 3HD/12HP monster are, + XP equivalent of the treasure a Princess "monster" would have, going by the random charts.

Here's a rough outline:\n<blockquote>Adventurers gain experience points by helping the free people against the Shadow, and other more mundane threats of the world. All characters are by default aligned "Good"; some few are aligned Neutral, and follow different xp rules. To be specific, a Neutral character gains xp from treasure in the traditional manner; this might or might not be a good deal, considering how we're not seeding dungeons with treasure just because we'd have to. Presumably "Evil" characters might gain experience points by personal achievement, although this is mostly an academic interest for the campaign.<br/><br/>Most characters, though, gain xp from good deeds. The basic amount is 1 xp per each person "saved from peril". Saving from peril is not an extremely high threshold in that the danger averted doesn't have to be immediately lethal; saving a village from a monster lurking in the woods counts xp for the entire population of the village due to everybody being at risk of grievous bodily harm, for example, despite the monster concretely eating only one person each week. Similarly vanquishing a tyrant scores xp for the population of the entire city-state. In other words, the "peril" needs to be life-defining, but it does not have to be absolute.<br/><br/>Helping named, significant characters accrues more experience: such a character rescued from peril is worth 1,000 xp per HD. Merely helping such a character in a less perilous quest or mission is worth 100 xp per HD. The difference between these cases is in the "peril": if the stakes of success or failure involve life-changing peril for the rescuee, then it's worthy of the higher rate, while a mission or service undertaken for a king or such is worth the lesser rate. The mission xp is "per adventure", pinged as appropriate when long-term service is concerned.<br/><br/>Finally, vanquishing creatures of the shadow (meaning, directly demonic beings with no capacity for redemption) is worth 100 xp per HD. This is basically because of the absolutist cosmology where certain beings <i>are</i> objectively evil. Where in doubt, only apply this reward to beings to which you know this requirement to apply.<br/><br/>Helping 0th level characters in non-perilous straits is not worth experience points. Helping yourself is not worth experience points, but helping a friend, PC or NPC, is. Vanquishing ordinary foes of non-shadowy persuasion is not worth experience points.</blockquote>\nThe thing about these alternative xp rules is that I don't consider these as creative drift, because I do not think that amassing loot is the core creative interest of D&amp;D; it's a game about challenging adventures, not a game about building a money silo for swimming exercises. The core reason for why the xp for treasure rule is a good idea is that it's objective-driven and easy to quantify; if we want to hack the genre of the game a bit, it's simple enough to switch to a different measure of success that is less about the money and more about heroic deeds, at least as long as we can quantify those deeds objectively. I'm pretty happy about this "1 xp for each person saved" metric in this regard: it's easy to calculate, and just as objective and sensible as "1 gp = 1 xp".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428832/#Comment_428832" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T08:32:09+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  8:32AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At least one edition of Rolemaster had an "XP for Miles Traveled" reward that might adapt well to an exploration/hex crawl type game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428834/#Comment_428834" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T08:40:23+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  8:40AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's another good example of an entirely reasonable and straightforward "campaign concept" backed by quantifiable xp rewards: brave explorers hungry for the distinction of being the first to the lake Chad or wherever, gaining 1 xp per mile traveled in uncharted territory.

A considerable chunk of time to be sure. It'd have been quicker if I didn't feel like writing it up on paper, of course. And the inspiration (the premise about an elf-cursed baronetcy, that is) was pre-existing, so that didn't take any time. I think I probably spent most of the time putting the details on that micro-dungeon at the end of the text.<br/><br/>The session we played took perhaps 8 hours, I think - it was pretty long, being a weekend session. Much of the material wasn't really plumbed right then and there, though; the \u017eupan still exists in the setting, the Solomonari order exists, a player character who's still in play adopted the quasit, we obviously didn't even scratch at the big dungeon implied by that prep, and so on, so it's a bit difficult to measure how much playtime that prep is going to turn into, given time. 8 hours immediately and however much in long-term consequences.<br/><br/>In general, though, I do agree with the implicit point that prep takes time in this style of play, there's no way around that. Fortunately, however, that prep is very much transmissible and accumulating: you'd be up to your ears in work if you were one of those poor bastards who feel the need to prep every single session carefully and specifically, but in reality it's entirely trivial to rely on other people's stuff and long-term prep for the majority of your content. That particular session got a more detailed prep because of how it was a one-shot run in a campaign where I normally participate as a player instead of GM, so I had more overhead than usual to fill; in ordinary circumstances I prep maybe one hour for each 20-100 hours of play, plus whatever time might be taken by pre-reading adventure modules (which is difficult to count as prep time, as I do it for all sorts of other reasons as well, whether I'm currently GMing anything or not).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428871/#Comment_428871" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T00:35:00+00:00" title="February 27, 2014 12:35AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't know, maybe 4-5 hours? </blockquote>\nSo 12-15 hours prep in normal-people time, right?

I've long been thinking how would I make a Traveller game interesting in this age of mechanics for player contribution to setting and rewarding player interests and goals. I'm not sure you need that, you just need a group of players ready to engage the game as presented and make the sorts of extensions Eero has shared for D&amp;D if absolutely necessary, but otherwise, engage the game as is, and find motivation for adventure.<br/><br/>I don't know all the procedures Paul Gazis used, but I always admired his Eight Worlds campaign. He revamped some of the game mechanics to suit his tastes, but I think he ran a pretty hygienic game and sure attracted quite a crowd of players.

From what I've heard I understand that it has been played for similar kicks as I do with D&amp;D, so presumably one could have a neutral referee, challenge-oriented campaign, goal-oriented player activity and so on in it as well. Certainly there's nothing in the subject matter to prevent it. Besides, many count recent interest in Traveller as a part of the OSR scene - as has been discussed elsewhere, the concept of "OSR" is pretty vague when all's said and done.\n<blockquote>Would you say that there's a certain need for prep, or at least to behave is if an objective scenario exists for which you are "referee" rather the later incarnation of the Dungeon Master as provider of entertainments through improvisation?</blockquote>\nWell, yes - it is a central conceit of the way D&amp;D is structured that the Dungeon Master is a "referee" who portrays a scenario and leads the resolution process to find out how the scenario falls out. It is also true that the conception of the Dungeon Master as a storyteller or circus ring-leader (these differ subtly in expectations) is a very early one, and e.g. Gary Gygax apparently subscribed to what I would consider an incoherent view of the activity. (I'm sure that somebody else would merely see his perspective as all-encompassing rather than incoherent; whatever the case, fact is that it was pretty early that D&amp;D got gripped by the challenging notion that you should be capable of being an impartial referee and an entertaining storyteller at the same time.)<br/><br/>You don't absolutely have to have a prepared scenario to run this sort of a game, but large-scale improvisation requires a much higher degree of procedural hygiene to avoid the game becoming the GM's arbitrary storytelling exercise. When running a sandbox you'll often end up improvising from very sketchy notes, so it's an excellent skill to learn. Meanwhile, though, a well-prepared dungeon environment is very easy to run: as is often remarked, one reason for why D&amp;D is so dungeon-oriented in practical materials might be that it's so easy to referee the fiction within the simple underground environment, with its limited social complexities and well-defined spatial geometry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428939/#Comment_428939" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-28T13:48:36+00:00" title="February 28, 2014  1:48PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Potemkin, Frank - I'm a little confused by your references to running Traveller "hygienically" without reference to specific goals.

Given that a bunch of players decides "hey, Fred just rolled a Merchant character who mustered out with a ship, let's play a game where all the PCs are crew members on the ship," one can then use the procedures provided in the game, along with perhaps some additional procedures developed by the group to run such a game hygienically.<br/><br/>The various Traveller modules might be less suitable for hygienic play (they did quickly fall into a metaplot), so there is more work by the GM to set up a hygienic setting (however, the game provides procedures for randomly generating sub-sectors).<br/><br/>The GM could also come up with a sandbox setting and then let the players decide what to do with that setting.<br/><br/>Frank<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428963/#Comment_428963" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-01T02:32:27+00:00" title="March  1, 2014  2:32AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is tons of sandbox support in Classic Traveller.

(Although D&amp;D is interesting in that technically speaking the task of party organization should fall on the party leader, not the GM, so in practice it's often not necessary for the GM to have a firm handle on social organization of the crew. Depends on the skills of the group, of course, and you can't exactly have party leadership established before a first session.) Both video chat and text chat have been suggested, and I'm up for either myself. Google Hangouts and IRC are respectively the easiest options for me in the two categories. I imagine that we'll use online whiteboards, Google Docs and so on in either case for secondary documentation.<br/><br/>As for the time, mid-afternoon GMT (Mike's last suggestion) would be around 3pm, right? I'm at GMT+2 myself, but currently also being somewhat nocturnal, so I'll likely take a nap before the game. It'd be most convenient if we can get the timing firmed up within the next 8 hours, so I can schedule my napping. An early start is probably better than a late one, all other things being equal, as it's not difficult to join in on-going proceedings mid-session, while the session setup ("logistical phase" as I like to call it) is likely going to eat up an hour or two from a first session, no matter what one does.<br/><br/>Regarding plan of action: unless Mike has some different plans, our initial to-do list will probably look like something like this:<br/>1) Mike gives the low-down on the setting, or we brainstorm the broad strokes if he doesn't have anything in particular. Role of the fantastic, magic, demihumans, religious and ideological nature of the society, technology level, literary flavour - that sort of thing.<br/>2) Whip up some characters according to whatever system framework Mike's starting with.<br/>3) Get the adventure from Mike, or the sandbox context if he's got multiple hooks. Plan, gear up and prepare for action.<br/><br/>The above are all things that can be done "in advance" to various degrees if one feels like it, so Mike shouldn't hesitate to call the session to begin a bit early if it comes to that; it is quite effortless to join a session even after other players have already processed the logistics phase, after all.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428997/#Comment_428997" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-02T03:17:40+00:00" title="March  2, 2014  3:17AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yo!

The players were Eero, DWeird and my non-SG chum Sam (who, incidentally, was my first DM) who explored the entrance to the Wizard's Seafort off the shores of Greysands. There was lots of good player strategizing, fast combat and meaty reward. After a few more session I'm thinking of opening another thread and posting a write-up. <br/><br/>Sam says he really enjoyed the game - it was the first time playing old school but he took to the procedural nature of play well and wants back for more. In other Sam news, I introduced him to Dungeon World; he loved it and has been running a game for 4 months now totally unaware of where it came from. <br/><br/>Over on this side of the DM's screen, I had real trouble deciding when exploration "turns" were over (i.e. when 10 minutes had passed) and so when I needed to roll for wandering monsters/torches etc. So perhaps the Dungeon was a little less crowded that it should have been. I might instigate some "ritual phrasing" to help clearly demark the end of the player's actions and the start of a new turn. "Time passes..." or something. <br/><br/>Also, I found converting my map into descriptions of space that the players are exploring difficult. The map was loose so I had to eyeball distances in play which came up when the players asked about how far the light from their torches spread, and generally the dungeon was so tightly spaced that that would never be a problem (i.e. if a PC has a light he can see everything in sight).

If your dungeon (and your rules gloss) is such that light and movement speed do not matter, then they don't matter. Not everybody has to fill their games with the same cookie cutter content.<br/><br/>That being said, a single torch doesn't really shed light too far; atmospheric scatter mutes light over distance, as everybody knows <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> For comparison's sake, I recently created a GM screen for OSR D&amp;D and put some numbers in it. ("Real Constants", a list of various useful natural constants from my own play and research.) Looking it over, I set a candle to shed light up to 5 feet, a torch to 10-40 feet (depending on the construction of the torch, mainly) and a lantern 40-60 feet (ditto). When you also account for some activities being light-sensitive, so that the dimness of lightning matters, it becomes easily possible for the party's chosen lightning strategy to become pertinent. Our home campaign regularly features situations where light is insufficient to see the other end of a room from its door, for example - especially when you'd need to see something more than just there maybe being a wall there out in the dark.<br/><br/>Of course these are definitely "expert" considerations of dungeoneering, I wouldn't expect a beginner campaign to pay too much attention to things like lightning conditions, dehydration, social hacking of monster encounters, proper shock entrance tactics, effective scouting and so on; there are many, many things that naturally only come up when the group has sufficient expertise to process the simpler things routinely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429048/#Comment_429048" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-03T04:58:14+00:00" title="March  3, 2014  4:58AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Potemkin:<br/><br/>If you're being a really evil DM, the problem with light isn't just that you can only see a limited distance around you effectively, it's that other people can see you holding the light from an almost unlimited distance, provided nothing is blocking line-of-sight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429050/#Comment_429050" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-03T05:36:44+00:00" title="March  3, 2014  5:36AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Potemkin:<br/><br/>If you're being a really evil DM, the problem with light isn't just that you can only see a limited distance around you effectively, it's that other people can see you holding the light from an almost unlimited distance, provided nothing is blocking line-of-sight.</blockquote>\nThat's the general assumption, right? I mean, it's a little tricky with the rules insisting on a "Surprise" roll for monsters as the standard beginning of an encounter but I'd assume that light and noise alert the denizens of the deep to the presence of intruders at a reasonable distance.

The undercurrent (theoretical, and apparently practical as well) was quite clear: high-level PCs would have their own alignments, political commitments and goals, that might potentially segue into conflicts between characters who could have been comrades in arms in the past. Some magic items such as the helm of reverse alignment mostly get their point from this assumed background: they're amusing excuses for team-swapping, a reason for why past friends become the bitterest enemies. (Tim Kask wrote about this a couple years back in a pretty compelling manner, I seem to remember; he should know.)<br/><br/>This is a pretty in-depth topic (mostly because the question is not how the game might work, but how it was in fact historically understood and utilized), and I encourage people interested in studying the hopes and dreams of the early '70s gamers to read e.g. the Dragonsfoot forums, and the articles and interviews by various people who were there. There is quite a bit of information out there. My own current impression of the matter, for what it's worth, is basically the same as Bob's: while the nature of the game might not have elevated into a complexly layered wargame consistently, every time and everywhere, the shared world and the potential of the game to segue into more traditional wargaming was definitely acknowledged. For example, it's quite explicitly known that the first Greyhawk campaign had multiple GMs, character stables, multiple adventuring parties, and such, just like our own on-going campaign does today. The Chainmail connection isn't an accident, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429089/#Comment_429089" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-04T02:23:45+00:00" title="March  4, 2014  2:23AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2014 2:26AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/> My own current impression of the matter, for what it's worth, is basically the same as Bob's: while the nature of the game might not have elevated into a complexly layered wargame consistently, every time and everywhere, the shared world and the potential of the game to segue into more traditional wargaming was definitely acknowledged.

I spent a great deal of time assuming that the player's characters were all wandering independently about a world map and could be generally coaxed or coerced into banding together for mutual gain (i.e. to go into dungeons), but for the most part players would be exploring the hex and uncovering secrets and treasures on their own as a part of a discrete individual player-turn, like a boardgame (perhaps <i>Talisman </i>is the closest game to what I thought D&amp;D was). What we understand as the party dungeon crawl would have been an advanced state of play involving player negotiation and collaboration before splitting off again. I had assumed that you could then take your hero with all his XP and Treasure into another DM's game and that players would walk around with a character sheet ready to adventure with anyone willing to provide a hex. Crazy, I know, but I was very young. I thought <i>Warhammer </i>worked in a similar way. <br/><br/>Is this kind of thing probably could do with another thread, but I'm loath to start more OSR discussion.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429091/#Comment_429091" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-04T03:04:46+00:00" title="March  4, 2014  3:04AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's actually a quite nice vision of how D&amp;D might be. Not that different from how it actually is, either, at least the way we play it. The character stable in practice causes everybody to have characters in the same place at the same time, though, as it is so easy to just say that hey if we're going to be spending this entire session messing about with your war here, how about I make up your NPC lieutenant as a player character - sort of a combined opportunity to develop more characters and a conceit for why the player is gabbing with you about your plans at the table despite his own character currently being at the other end of the continent, doing their own thing.<br/><br/>The way I explain the true nature of D&amp;D as an emergent phenomenon is that there is "low-level" play and then there is "high-level" play, and the latter is, indeed, all about individual heroes traipsing around doing their own thing. The point where this game breaks might be a little surprising: it's when you get the idea that same-level characters should stick together as a cadre. I've found that not having this preconception has enabled us to discover a much more natural dynamic of play where characters tend to drift apart when they get to mid-levels, new lower-level characters join them, and the original party branches out into a bunch of alternate storylines. Everybody plays each other's grunts and henchmen, in other words, instead of insisting on keeping the original cadre together when it doesn't feel natural to do so.<br/><br/>In our big campaign a few years back this maturation phenomenon started when individual characters started to get to around 3rd level, after a few dozen sessions of play. One character was ambitious for social position, so he married into a rich merchant family and funded his own mercenary company for the emperor's wars in Italy; another got a religious insight that indicated that he would have to put to rest this ancient pre-Christian pagan god that still existed as a malevolent presence in the dark recesses of the fantasy-Bohemian wilderness; a third quested for a cure to a divine disease he'd procured by stealing from the wrong holy places, ended up turning into an elf, and became a dark magician who ultimately perished by becoming the vessel of a high-level necromancer's rebirth. Then there were also two separate missionary expeditions to the Orient, led by two particularly religious priestly sorts of characters, and a side story regarding a crime spree ending in incarceration and a journey to a penal colony in the distant north.<br/><br/>All of the above storylines were strategic-level concerns in between actual adventures, and they were handled organically in parallel to each other. Generally speaking each player would have their own "main" character who had their own concerns, but they would then also have lower-level characters joining in on other people's stories. Which character you'd play in each adventure would depend on campaign causality (whether a given character was available at a given time and place, or if he was busy somewhere else) and individual motivations; no point bringing a character who didn't care about a given adventure's goals into it. Not all players had their "own" storylines, as this sort of thing depends on what you're interested in; some just want to tag along. Such players would usually keep their characters aloof of commitments, so they could naturally continue playing that one character at a time, jumping between "theaters of operation" as we usually call these different branches of a campaign.<br/><br/>The current "spin-off" campaign in which I'm being a player works exactly like this as well. I personally currently have characters involved in two main storylines: one concerns the setting up of a Skoptsi monastery in Moldova (gaining funding and social acceptance for it by doing great deeds for the locals, basically), while another is about delving into Stonehell dungeon for the cure to a space-slug plague infesting a a Moldovan city. (I think I've got two characters involved in each of these, in somewhat different situations.) These two branches of the campaign, and others that aren't currently active but might come up at any time, exist in the same campaign world and cross over where appropriate.<br/><br/>So all in all, it seems very natural to me to conceptualize D&amp;D as a large, meandering exercise in world-building and wargaming: once we have a campaign setting going, it's easy to utilize its existing lore and established events as springboards for further play. As is natural for my Platonic conception of D&amp;D, I consider most of the above to be natural necessities that devolve directly from the creative agenda and technical strategy of the game; I am not surprised that our own practices resemble the original '70s campaigns in so many ways, as we have just been doing what comes naturally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429096/#Comment_429096" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-04T05:08:20+00:00" title="March  4, 2014  5:08AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool!

For example, the aforementioned elf-turned-into-vessel-of-dark-magic was ultimately set against the entire rest of the crew. I think the player in question even played a second character who participated in the take-down. It's not really much of a problem to have PCs set against each other as long as the creative agenda aligns with it; the usual issues with PvP stem from an agenda conflict where players fail to discuss the nature of the challenge together, and one player ends up being disruptive (for reasons such as being bored and not being included in the decision-making over the real adventure), using character roleplaying as an excuse. If you have the ability to step out of the situation and talk it over between the players, then this isn't much of a problem. Just figure out with the players whether they see a legitimate, interesting challenge in having the PCs fight each other, or if doing that just ruins the scenario.<br/><br/>As for the inverse D&amp;D, that'd be quite interesting! The biggest issue is easily the fact that the normal D&amp;D technical toolset only basically has one way to arrange that low-level situation where each player has individual characters on their own adventures: choose one character at a time, establish their scenario, proffer companion or opposing characters for the others to play (so that they have something to do instead of just watching the proceedings), and then execute the scenario. Repeat with the characters of the other players. The problem here is that it doesn't make much sense for us to first create e.g. six 1st level characters, only to then play individual sessions for each of them in turn - why did we create these other characters if we're only going to focus on this single one's adventures at a time?<br/><br/>It would be possible to finesse this by abstracting things massively (as in, one-roll adventure resolution), so that play can skip from character to character in their own individual adventures in turn. This could perhaps be used as some sort of prologue for the game proper, I could imagine: during the first session you dice and tell about what your characters got up to before they joined together to sail this ship over the edge of the world, or whatever it is that causes the adventurer cadre to actually come together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429239/#Comment_429239" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-08T07:11:43+00:00" title="March  8, 2014  7:11AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I imagine inverse D&amp;D to have to reconfigure how "Player Turns" work. The level of detail in PC activities simply can't be sustained in this format; the table can't sit around for a session speculating on one player's adventures. A strict action sequence would have to be set up - much more like a wargame - so you'd have a movement round (the all players travelling announce their direction of travel, whether or not they're gunna forced march etc.), then an exploring round (the all players roll for encounters), then some kind of abstracted resolution roll with fallout tables for failure ("Ok Bret, your barbarian is defeated by the goblins... fall out is... [roll]... your horses or pack-animals are slain."). So, much more action is dependent on few rolls and we can quickly move from location to location, PC to PC to follow the action. <br/><br/>Ok gang, I want to try run some more Primordial OSR this sunday afternoon (GMT) so let me know if you're available!

The nature of the game is such that it only improves for the first dozen sessions (around which time it plateaus at a level of consistent satisfaction dotted with peaks of excellence, at least for me), so you should see about giving Sam a taste of how the mid-term arcs of the game work.<br/><br/>Regarding a second session, I'd love to play (if only to see how Mike's GMing and the group's adeptness at making D&amp;D procedures work in chat develops), but I'll very likely be out the entire day on Sunday, playing another game. Next week I'll be available on Tuesday and from Thursday onwards, especially if we can get the date a couple days in advance so I don't book anything.<br/><br/>Either way, feel free to use the chat room; that's what it is there for, and the natives don't exactly bite. I recommend that if you don't like going to visit the bishop for some strategic wrangling (that was my idea, I think - sounds like my thinking), just get back to that dungeon and see if you can drag out some treasure from there. Or wile wizard-cultists of arcane perdition, at least.<br/><br/>Regarding how to set up that reverse-party game, I'm thinking along similar lines regarding one-roll adventure resolution.

Doom with other PCs. Shove in a hex map, the power to spend money on services and a more robust character generation and you pretty much have what I'm looking at here. <br/><br/>There's another option here: dropping the early-game and starting the players off in the "realm-management" level of play. So, the players are lesser nobles charged with settling the wilderness - they each get a keep spaced out on two sides of a hexmap and have to hire parties to explore, build out-posts and pay taxes, as well as managing a band of powerful "PC" retainers. I'd like to say this is the bit where it gets all <i>Game of Thrones</i>/RTS, but my suspicion is that this phase of D&amp;D must be carefully controlled or else it'll loose all cohesion. <br/><br/><br/>The Wizard's Fort ain't going anywhere yet, Eero and Paul. I'm sure a little poke around tomorrow won't expose too many of its secrets.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429267/#Comment_429267" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-09T06:14:17+00:00" title="March  9, 2014  6:14AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Afternoon all - anyone interested in playing today should assemble <a href="http://irc.lc/ircnet/habavaara/irctc@@@" rel="nofollow">here</a> between 2-3 (GMT), all welcome.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429497/#Comment_429497" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-16T09:50:12+00:00" title="March 16, 2014  9:50AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Session again today, at 10 PM GMT, <a href="http://irc.lc/ircnet/habavaara/irctc@@@" rel="nofollow">same place as always.</a> As always, everyone is welcome.<br/><br/>We're doing a bit of buffet style gaming right now, where we pick between different styles or engagements (or even DMs) between sessions. We had ourselves some regular dungeon-delving, a long-term "doing stuff in the village" project that was aimed to deal with a specific type of threat in the dungeon, and the latest session was a hexcrawl. We'll probably continue the hexcrawl this session, though that depends.<br/><br/>Fictionally, we're now at the place where NPCs start to recur and the world begins to grow. A lot of it is couched in an ongoing conversation about the game, where statements about the greater world are first introduced as guesses, speculations or jokes ("Wouldn't it be interesting if..." "I wonder whether..." "Ha, that's strange! It must be because of..."), but then become 'facts' after someone picks one of them back up and runs with them.<br/><br/>Also, a lot of the theory-speak that kicked this thread off continues in the form of inter- or post-game analysis or commentary (as we've all got some interest in game design, we will take breaks to make clear not just how a given procedure functions at a specific moment, but also why and how it does in general, and what alternatives could look like). If you have no interest in playing, but would like to take a look at the game as it unfolds and then participate in the post-game discussion, feel free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429503/#Comment_429503" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-16T23:53:49+00:00" title="March 16, 2014 11:53PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted to say thank you for letting me try this out yesterday! I checked in three hours early, and we ended up starting early just me, Daumantas (Bodigon) and referEero. We started on a sidequest and Lark the Elf got some solid pathfinding stuff in before almost losing his sister to a hellhound.<br/><br/>However, I checked the character sheets this morning and found Agador, Zizek and Bodigon dead or MIA! What happened, and where was Lark? (If this is the wrong thread for it, just say so)<br/><br/><br/>As for the game, it was about what I expected, including at least as fun as I was hoping! I've never played anything OSR before. I started thinking about it after what ended up being my favourite session of that AW game. It had my gunlugger breaking into a guarded outpost to kill the leader and leave without a trace. I ended up not rolling for almost anything but the initial <i>read a sitch</i>, because I managed to solve the problem of navigating the fiction. It sounds simple, but after years of roleplaying I think that was the first extended conflict which felt like it was solved entirely by doing that. And it was great! The contract of "finding and meeting tactical challenges in a well-defined fictional world", or however you put it in this thread before, was in place for that scene.<br/><br/>And this meeting was like, only that! I've been looking forward to actually play something like this for a long time now, to see if it actually holds what promises I've built up in my head. Turns out it can! Both the hex-crawling and the combat (which in many respect was very much like stuff I've been thinking indie has "solved") was a blast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429504/#Comment_429504" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T04:23:05+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  4:23AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2014 4:26AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pleased you had fun! Once again I'd like to express my gratitude to Eero for being willing to GM at a moment's notice (my sunday evening was taken up ferrying a grandmother about and I could only join later as the player of Zizek). <br/><br/>I'm certain Eero would chide me for revealing what happened to our characters (the party being split at the time) but suffice it to say there may have been several tactical errors on my behalf that lead to the death of Brother Zizek, chief amongst them was failing as a player over IRC to read that Bodigon had fallen in combat and Zizek faced the PC-killers on his own. That being said, it was a good death (a 1 HP Level 1 Cleric killed one assailant before falling, always a plus).<br/><br/>I'm keen to renew my position as nominal GM. Who'd be interested in tackling the Seafort once again during an evening this week?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429506/#Comment_429506" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T05:16:16+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  5:16AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't mind not knowing what happened in detail, but if someone would fill me in on what Lark did for the rest of the session (or where he was left to do nothing, if that's it), that'd be swell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429507/#Comment_429507" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T06:29:11+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  6:29AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that there is such a thing as a code of omerta that would prevent people from bragging about what happens in the game <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> The only issue is that getting OOC tactical knowledge might undermine the challenge of some scenario you are about to engage yourself, but that's pretty much on the head of the listener - if you know that you're going to be playing that same scenario yourself not to soon, then perhaps you don't want to listen to minute analysis of what went right and what went wrong when somebody else tackled it. Certainly nothing that happened in this session is anything I'd consider top secret, perhaps excepting the fate of poor Agador.<br/><br/>The normal process for handling PCs whose players aren't present is to pretty much ignore their presence as a logistical, strategic and tactical factor - they are assumed to technically speaking be present in the fiction (they're not, despite how players like to joke, trapped in pokeballs for the duration), but they take care of themselves, take no initiative, are in no danger, tend to drift further away from danger, and do not affect the fate of other characters. For instance, in this case the elven contingent of the party as a whole rallied to defend and recuperate; they found an elfhome (a safe wilderness location with much reduced random encounter rates) and are staying there until everybody is again healthy and hale - probably about a week before they feel well enough to travel, what with that throat injury.<br/><br/>(Such "deprotagonizing" fictional positioning as having your character sidelined for a week because he's taking care of his injured sister are a richness for a sandbox for several reasons, not a weakness: the player might be under pressure to run a second character while their main man recuperates, or the event might turn into general downtime. In any case such "holes in the calendar" become important fictional cornerstones upon which other interesting developments may hinge. For example, now it is the case that the elves are the only party with first-hand knowledge of the fate of poor Bodigon, and of the ominous Tower of Love; this fictional positioning might or might not have significance in the future.)<br/><br/>That was indeed mightily amusing when two 0th level dishonest retainers overcame Zizek, Bodigon and the lone honest retainer. Zizek proved himself fundamentally unsuited to the dangerous rigours of the adventurer's life when he failed to take sides in the impromptu knife-fight, directly contributing to the death of Bodigon. The entire event was a fine reminder of the dangers of taking retainers for granted <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429508/#Comment_429508" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T06:59:25+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  6:59AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gah, and we the elves made such a point of being on our guard for them as well!

Bodigon made no attempt to elicit Zizek's help and with everyone distracted in combat I felt it was wise to wait until the deed was done and then attempt to bring the victor to justice for the ungodly murder of their comrades (sling-clerics don't enter melee willingly). Zizek so far had been a beast with his ranged attacks and I'd been hoping to take out both murderers before they closed the distance but, alas, I got charged despite winning surprise. This, combined with various little procedural oversights on my part as a player, meant leading Zizek to his untimely death. This is what you get for playing moral but hesitant holy men. <br/><br/>That being said, I have no idea how this fight got started. Were the disruptive henchmen only there because Bodigon decided to hang out with them and eat his lunch rather than join the others toward the tower of love, or were they always destined to rob the party's supplies and kill anyone in their way once we got out of town? Either way is fine, after all exciting things need to happen to the player characters, but I'd be interested to look into the procedure at work here. This kind of event makes me UTTERY PARANOID about hiring henchmen (without at least knowing their true disposition towards the PCs) despite how essential they are to low-level play.

As you probably noticed, I sort of clicked with the Moldway initiative system yesterday and rapidly developed it into something more meaningful during play itself. This was a good example of what I mean by organic mechanical innovation through rulings in play, as it arose from my personal relationship to the way the Moldway rules work.<br/><br/>For background context: I like group initiative, but detest the round-by-round initiative rolls used by so many Basic D&amp;D iterations. It's just not a worthwhile way to spend your time to have an extra roll at the start of each and every round merely to find out who acts first that round. This issue of action order doesn't simply matter enough for the amount of bother it causes, by itself.<br/><br/>I also, however, like to innovate regarding what initiative means: I find the traditional sense of "who acts first" to be devoid of realism and excitement. In a split-second combat situation initiative can be so much more, as quick decision-making and situation awareness allows you to make better choices and plainly get inside the enemy OODA loop to disrupt their actions and ideally overrun their ability to react to your action.<br/><br/>My recent home rules have generally used a 3rd edition derived complex individual initiative system that is relatively heavy-weight (we spend about as much time and attention with initiative as with attack rolls), but enables stuff like extra actions per round, exact quantification of how various actions start and stop and get interrupted, paying with initiative score for situation awareness, and stuff like that. Not really something I would even consider porting to an IRC game with a new crew while using the Moldway rules as a base - much too heavy, much too different from how the rest of Moldway operates. Besides, I don't think I have a letters patent from the group to just put fire on the entire Moldway mechanical base and substitute it with my own <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Now that I've been living here in Helsinki and been a player, the campaign has been using the LotFP rules as its base, which means return to the Basic initiative system, essentially the same as Moldway. You might imagine that I've thus had my fill of the vapid initiative rolls: nothing exciting ever happens, that initiative roll just shuffles the actions so that sometimes instead of ABAB the actions occur in ABBA or BAAB order.<br/><br/>Anyway, in last night's session I had a vision of how this concept of lightweight d6 initiative should be utilized: you roll the initiatives, and then the difference between the rolls indicates a "series" of combat rounds during which one side or the other holds the initiative without further rolls. So rolls of 2 vs 5 indicate that the latter party holds initiative for three rounds, for example.  Such a "series" can be broken by any extraordinary interference in the flow of battle (successful disengagement, one side's leader biting it, etc.), in which case there are simply new initiatives rolled. Each "series" represents an unbroken melee combat at utmost levels of effort, perhaps \xbd-1 minutes or so in length. (So instead of each round being strictly 10 seconds, we assume that each series is a minute long - or perhaps we assume both of these at once.)<br/><br/>So far so good, but the real point comes in considering what it means for a party to hold the initiative during a single series, and what it means for a "series" to end, in fictional terms. For the first point I basically started piling on any advantages that came up for the side with initiative: both sides of the combat dynamic still get their goes, one per round, it's just that the initiative side tends to get better intel and opportunity to act. For examples, the init side gets to choose action last and execute first, the init side may choose to attack or defend (in footwork terms - whether you're giving ground or taking it), the init side may switch weapons at the start of the series without penalty (using that couple of seconds that they stole for it), and so on. Basically, with the initiative you're just treated a bit better in the action negotiations.<br/><br/>As for that second question, I promptly stole the notion of "reorientation action" from my home game - in that system with its minute-long combat rounds each round has a "between bouts" phase in between combat rounds, during which things PCs can do things that are untenable in actual melee; retreat, drinking potions, talking with the enemy or allies, committing to spells for the next round are things that are done at this juncture, the round itself being much too quick and hazardous action for such things.<br/><br/>Applying this concept to Mentzer, I found myself pushing these off-melee tactical actions to the end of individual "series" of rounds, according to the concept as I explain it above. So instead of letting the players deliberate e.g. retreat or reshuffling of melee every round, I delayed that until each individual series finished due to either disruption (somebody did something to disengage the melee) or the series running to its natural end. (Each series with these d6 initiative rolls are 1-5 rounds long, depending on the rolls).<br/><br/>The most dramatic use of these new concepts was in that fight between the General and poor Mithryn: Mithryn was entirely outforced by the 10 HD General, despite its modest unarmed stature, and the situation was only made worse by the General's utter domination in terms of initiative - it's not a fast creature, but even a heavy and slow one can get the jump on you if you stumble, leaving you to scramble for defense while it rains heavy blows on you. This was what happened to Mithryn, who in fact attempted a disengagement action to get out of the lethal series of action rounds before he'd be taken down by the monster. I was pleased with this fight, as I was with the elves vs. the hellhound fight earlier, as they showed concretely how I could make the initiative matter more: the elves had a major advantage in being able to predict who the hellhound was going to jump for each round (thanks to getting to hear its action before taking their own), and the General had an advantage in being able to prevent Mithryn from disengaging from a fight that had turned ill for him.<br/><br/>So that's an interesting thing from the session, at least for me - I can totally understand if the above seems like hot air and GM arbitrariness to other people, but from my viewpoint I was developing new tenets for a slightly different twist on the D&amp;D combat procedure. Making it my own once again, in a sense <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> If this sea-change is allowed to flower, I imagine that my next step will be to decide how missile weapons and magic latch onto this concept of "series" of rounds...<br/><br/>The implicit creative nature of the process is also illuminating to consider, when thinking about the creative dynamics of D&amp;D: as is often the case, this development of new initiative concepts happened largely through the agency the GM has in instructing the mechanical process: I never stopped to explain what I'd realized to the other players, I merely implemented it. I in fact don't know if the others noticed that I was drifting mechanically - either they accepted the way I parsed the fiction into mechanics, or they noticed nothing different, even as the principles behind the combat round logic were undergoing a revolution. Over the long term the players would presumably either tacitly accept the new parsing of the familiar concepts, even if I didn't get around to explaining myself, or they would complain, starting a judicial review process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429511/#Comment_429511" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T07:19:07+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  7:19AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That being said, I have no idea how this fight got started.

Is this the difference between a henchman and a retainer?</blockquote>\nA good question. As the scenario is over and done with, I can comment up this: these henchmen and their very specific relationship to Sir Fondleroy Addleton, your erstwhile patron, are carefully outlined in the scenario I was running. So I didn't need e.g. disposition rolls or such as long as we remained within the purview of the scenario, as I knew exactly what these particular NPCs would do in certain conditions.<br/><br/>(Anybody wanting to read the scenario text upon which this adventure was based is welcome to find "The Tower of Duvan'Ku" in Fight On <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, I think. However, you should realize that reading that pretty much makes you non-eligible for entering the actual tower, should you be planning to do that later on. You can either read the adventure or play it, it doesn't make sense to do both.)<br/><br/>It is notable that the nature of these men had in fact been foreshadowed heavily in earlier parts of the adventure; Addleton himself hired you guys to escort him specifically because he'd overheard the men speculating about robbing him earlier on their travels. It wasn't exactly a surprise to Bodigon what happened.<br/><br/>Bodigon's remaining behind affected basically only one part of the events, and that was the fact that he decided to check up on the retainers, which ended up with him stumbling in the midst of their argument about what to do with Addleton's treasure now that the man himself was out of sight. Here Bodigon had many options as to how to approach the situation, including letting the men do whatever they wanted, but he decided to sort of float (refused to try a Charisma check to take control of the situation, for instance) until they got violent at each other, at which point he sided with the one guy who wanted to remain loyal to Addleton. Had Bodigon not been there, the two dishonest retainers would've knifed the honest one and left with the mule and the pearls, just like they did after finishing you two off.<br/><br/>Also: I definitely have no critique for how Zizek acted, or how Mike played him - it was all just fine with me. I'm just commiserating philosophically when I speculate about Zizek perhaps not having been cut out for an adventuring career, after all. It was just a tragedy how such a frail yet just man ended up mingling with such a band of cut-throats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429512/#Comment_429512" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T07:45:27+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  7:45AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2014 8:30AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff! <br/><br/>I noticed the new imitative order but felt discussing it during play would only steal back the time it had liberated. It's a fine system, sure, but brutal as all getout. It was excruciating watching Mithryn stagger under the orge's blows, unable to act for 4 rounds (or suffer opportunity attacks trying to  flee) while the orge let loose. In retrospect I feel Mithryn's death was a little unfair and feel the need for a review: having to sit and suffer 3-5 consecutive attack rounds is (a) dull and (b) unreasonably lethal even at high levels. Mithryn's only available action seemed to be to take the attacks or attempt to withdraw (and suffer AoO). A small change could be that for every "bonus" round the initative winner scores over 2 counts to another combat advantage (like disallowing withdrawl, or some other combat trick, disarming attempt etc). <br/><br/>This kind of thinking leads nicely to the creation of a swashbuckler class (conceptually one of my favourites but usually poorly implemented esp. 3.5) that gets specific situational boons for rolls in the initiative round if fighting on his own (much like a Thief's skills to use the Moldvay sensibilities - which I think are a good frame work for finding common ground between players from different play-cultures). I like the idea of having a mutable class system, or at least the capacity for reasoned player invention. <br/><br/>Coming late to play I was largely out of the picture in regards to what this adventure was and any understandings you'd come to with the other players. Perhaps this led in some way to Zizek's demise (which was always coming anyway and I'd rather die avenging another PC than to the proboscis of a random Sturge), but it's not too likely. The master strategy would have been to wait until the thieves took their spoils and withdrew, stabilising Bodigon if possible, then following their mule-tracks and harrying their retreat, hopefully fatally wounding them. Zizek could have then claimed the loot and XP (for ill or good).                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429513/#Comment_429513" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T08:31:59+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  8:31AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you're ignoring the default response of attacking back - it wasn't just one side getting "free" attacks on the other <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The only major difference here was the concept that breaking off a melee engagement has a price, you can't just decide at an arbitrary moment in close combat that you've had enough and leg it, not without risking repercussions. I feel that this is both pretty realistic, and pretty interesting.<br/><br/>I should clarify, the available means of getting out of combat under this systemic model would be as follows:<br/>- Outright run, unheeding the present and immediate danger of your opponent. Because the opponent is on top of things and has initiative, they're going to have a chance at striking you in the back as you turn your back on them. In other words: they get an opportunity attack, you get to flee.<br/>- Retreat defensively, attempting to outpace and mislead the opponent to get that crucial few feet of distance that'll allow you to turn and run without suffering that opportunity attack. This takes an action, requires a roll to succeed, and also gives you +4 to AC (or something of the sort - could be +2 maybe) even if you don't succeed; only possible if you can trade space for security, of course.<br/>- Wait under their onslaught for a break in the action that'll allow you to slip away. In other words, wait for the current "series" to end, and declare retreat before the next initiatives are rolled.<br/><br/>I don't think that this is that unreasonable, really. The traditional parsing with the miniatures logic feels much more unreasonable, in fact, as it assumes perfect balance, perfect footwork, and no combat friction of any sort. Of course under those assumptions it is always trivial to move out of combat - just move your miniature away from the enemy miniature. In real (open skirmish) combat it's not that simple, as you're moving all the time <i>anyway</i>, and the opponent is trying to actively kill you; you can't just wait for your turn and move away while they stand still waiting for their turn to occur.<br/><br/>In the actual situation with Mithryn he could have escaped earlier, before he was too weak to safely disengage (a typical D&amp;D player mistake regardless of mechanical details, by the way - players routinely play it too close in fights, leaving themselves open for an unexpected follow-up attack), or he could have had better luck on the dice.<br/><br/>I should note that I definitely don't want to criticize Shreyas's conduct of the fight here - D&amp;D is a wild and woolly game where situations change, and it was his first session with us, so it is entirely natural that he wouldn't know exactly what levers to pull there. Sort of like a newbie lawyer, they simply don't know when to call for that all-important objection to the opposition's dirty tricks. I admit that this sort of situation is inherently "unfair" - how could it be fair when the GM is experimenting with the combat system right in the middle of play, instead of carefully writing it down and sending it for approval in advance.<br/><br/>Also, for clarity: I introduced these innovations on referee operative prerogative yesterday - it's a right you have due to the fact that it's not possible to run an entirely inimical system reliably, so we generally let GMs fiddle with systems until they feel comfortable with them. However, this does not imply that I would require other GMs in the campaign to utilize the same procedures, or even that I demand these innovations to be used in the future. As I said above, anybody may call for judicial review and have my ideas from yesterday overturned in reasoned debate, such as what we're having here. (I feel the need to clarify this social process because the alternative opinions seem pretty wide-spread in the OSR scene, such as the idea that the GM is king and it's his way or highway. Can't be that, I don't have any right to piss on the campaign like that with rules that other players don't like.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429514/#Comment_429514" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T09:11:19+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  9:11AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recognise the shifting nature of our experimental play and don't hold you accountable for "getting it wrong" or anything like that, I'd just like to advocate for a peer-review of this system. Once I manage to get back into the DM chair I will certainly be testing innovations that still reward a good initiative roll but translates into more nuanced results; I am sickened by the concept of multiple attack rolls per round (especially as fast monsters, etc, have multiple attacks figured into their stats already) and anything more than two/round gets me very hot and bothered on either side of the DM-screen. I would rather give a damage boost to a single attack roll on a good initiative rather than describe how its victim is incapable of action (which produces similar rewards for good rolling but cuts down on the number of rolls per combat significantly). Frankly, if you were looking to save time in the procedure, there are more balanced and interesting ways of doing it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, perhaps Attack of Opportunity needs a dark twin: Something like "If a "to hit" roll is missed the victim can elect to seize the opportunity to withdraw from immediate range without suffering AoO." So, if the General had missed one of his blows then Mithryn could have interrupted the combat flow to withdraw from the immediate multi-attack being performed on him (although not from combat all together).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429518/#Comment_429518" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T11:31:43+00:00" title="March 17, 2014 11:31AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless you're referring to the attack-of-opportunity effect, I don't think there were any "multiple attacks" in play here. If I'm reading Eero correctly, his interpretation of the initiative roll was something like this:<br/><br/>"Okay, the evil general [ogre] has won initiative. This means that there will be 1-5 rounds before Mithryn has an opportunity to slip away with ease... if he wants to slip away now, he's vulnerable and he could get hit as he does so."<br/><br/>It doesn't limit his options against the ogre at all, it just means that he's entangled enough not to be able to simply step out of the ogre's way and run: the beast got the jump on him, after all.<br/><br/>I like this interpretation of the initiative rules, grim as it turned for Mithryn. (This had to do largely with everyone else abandoning him, mind you: while Zizek threw a stone at the general - to great effect, as usual! the shot would have felled any one of us - everyone else, including Bodigon, the retainers, and Agador, left him to die. So Mithryn's fate here is largely on the group, not just a series of poor rolls.)<br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>I very much like your take on initiative here. I've always thought that the interesting aspects of initiative were not "who goes first" in a perfectly symmetrical system (although that does make a big difference in the very first round of combat), but rather the declaration of actions (i.e. ability to know what your opponent is doing and react), flow of information (<i>how much</i> do you know before having to make your decision?), and perhaps better control of battlefield conditions (the initiative winner might have a better chance to pick <i>where</i> the clash of arms will take place on the battlefield, and to position themselves accordingly).<br/><br/>When I used to play Fudge, I always had a character ability called "Combat Reflexes", and it had to do with the character's battle experience. Someone rolling well would be able to collect information and make careful strategic choices; someone with poor outcomes might just be told, "Some dark shape is coming towards you, and there's a roar! What do you do?"<br/><br/>This seems like a good representation of character experience, in my mind.<br/><br/>However, I'd never considered the idea of extending initiative to a random "series" of rounds; this is a pretty neat idea. It sounds like it could be difficult to balance under certain circumstances, but very interesting, and represents the ebb and flow of combat well.<br/><br/>The only issue I see (aside from working out the specifics of just <i>how much</i> of an advantage having the initiative gives you) is that it must be possible to break out of a series. There should be a number of ways to interrupt the series and/or force a new roll before it's over. Eero, you mention a few above, and I think this is a good and important direction to go. A group which is facing 5 rounds of lost initiative against an overwhelming foe must have some good strategic options on hand rather than being forced to weather the 5 rounds. Fighting back is one good option: essentially, accepting the conditions of the fight and engaging in it fully seems right and proper to me. But other options might be worth considering. <br/><br/>For instance (and, for all I remember, maybe we even did this last night), when Zizek landed a powerful blow against the general (6 hit points of damage to the head has to be a pretty serious hit, as it would kill most men), I feel a good argument could have been made for that triggering a new initiative roll, perhaps allowing Mithryn to escape while the ogre was knocked off-balance momentarily. (Again, maybe this is what happened anyway - I don't particularly remember).<br/><br/>For the readers and onlookers, yes, all the characters but Lark perished in the mess, while Fondleroy disappeared into the Tower of Love. Agador pursued him and entered the Tower as well. Alas, he hasn't been since. Hence, I've marked his status as "missing in action" on the character sheet.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429519/#Comment_429519" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T11:31:49+00:00" title="March 17, 2014 11:31AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I emphasize once more: my suggestion above does not give anybody multiple attacks per round.

This is functionally the same as multiple attacks per round, only it takes more game-time. They're synonymous to be, but I can see were my language is confusing. I'll restate the point in clear terms but I think Paul caught it nicely when he said...\n<blockquote><br/>The only issue I see (aside from working out the specifics of just <i>how much</i> of an advantage having the initiative gives you) is that it must be possible to break out of a series.

I keep putting myself in Mithryn's shoes: if the combat sequence is so engaging that I cannot end it without taking injury, what options do I have? The best option is to weather the attacks and hope your assailant misses, rather than to flee and suffer an auto-hit, and that seems unintuitive. <br/><br/>Perhaps players could choose to loose ground or break formation, or a dozen realistic-sounding responses to being overwhelmed in combat? I don't think imitative success needs to always translate directly into opportunities to make a "to hit" roll. <br/><br/>I hope you don't find my bolshie attitude about revision mean-spirited, I'm just keen to get to the meat of the issue - I think this is a product of my time as a DM, operating under a credo of <i>"rule fast, rule light,"</i> and quickly barking out ruling tweaks in the manner of a combative auctioneer waiting for the subtle nods of players "buying in." It's a rude communication style and I should probably spend a little longer unpacking my thoughts on what and where feels off to me. <br/><br/>I can see the balances you've put onto this - like allowing interruption of a 1-5 round sequence with certain actions - but I don't think those balances are strong enough or communicated to the players at their time of greatest need (at the time of writing, of course :P ). <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429521/#Comment_429521" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T12:36:55+00:00" title="March 17, 2014 12:36PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The only issue I see (aside from working out the specifics of just <i>how much</i> of an advantage having the initiative gives you) is that it must be possible to break out of a series.

While I personally don't think that initiative played in this manner would <i>always</i> be decisive, at times it might well be a very good idea to be able to force a new initiative roll to seize the advantage. A lot depends on if you're fighting a conservative stationary battle, or relying on complex maneuver, as the latter is much more difficult if the opponent is on top of things and you aren't.<br/><br/>Regarding the General's reaction to Zizek's blow, it suffices to say that there are elements of the scenario in play there that influenced by judgement, but which I'm loathe to reveal before it's clear whether anybody's going back into that scenario. (I am of course discussing the specific mechanical abilities of the General here.) I will say that I considered the angle you're presenting, and judged it to my satisfaction, which holds in hindsight. In the situation that you think you saw, your judgement would be mine as well - such a surprising blow would well warrant a new initiative check.<br/><br/>The next interesting question I'll have to ponder on regarding this new idea is whether it warrants adding some slightly better tools for initiative manipulation to the game. The Basic D&amp;D initiative is basically a random roll, with few ways to influence it, but with the slightly increased importance it takes here it might be worthwhile to have a few basic ideas for how to guarantee a better initiative score. There are of course a lot of stock options in D&amp;D's mechanical history, I'll need to see if there are some that resonate particularly elegantly with this notion of "round series", and the conceit of group initiative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429523/#Comment_429523" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T12:41:51+00:00" title="March 17, 2014 12:41PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like maybe you'd want an option to attack the opponent's initiative, throwing them into disarray or something, instead of attacking their hitpoint pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429524/#Comment_429524" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T12:46:45+00:00" title="March 17, 2014 12:46PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yes, it's the lack of strategic options apparent that bothers me, truly.

Seems fair to me. It doesn't guarantee that you can escape every melee every time, but it's likely enough that after at most a couple of rounds of combat you'll be able to get out of underfoot and get the chance to run away. Frankly, to me this seems like the ideal balance: I want a melee combatant to be able to force combat on another, but I also want the other side to be able to run away if they don't want the fight.<br/><br/>I guess it could be even more powerful, but if you could just declare action to get out of the exchange of blows, then that pretty much obviates the whole concept of battlefield control - we're back in the "you hit, I hit" paradigm, where fighters just trade blows until one side decides that it's time to run rather than be taken down.<br/><br/>Of course, if the entire notion of melee being a dangerous pressure cooker doesn't entice, then I understand how this course of thinking doesn't seem appealing.

It's kind like saying "I like my comedies to be funny!" - that combat is supposed to be tense and suspenseful is a given, yo. Though it's probably safe to say that everyone interprets tactics and combat differently when you get down to it (we're armchair generals to a man after all). My general notion is that, while it feels realistic for you to be able to lock someone into combat, there should be a range of strategic options available to the defender - many of them negative but several preferable to loss of life that I would assume to be similar to "real world" events. It's at this stage that I think that forward thinking by the players about strategy, formation, command etc can be rewarded - that moment where the rat men are raining blows on your shields and the line's about to falter! Then the fighter leaps over the beleaguered henchmen's shield wall to stab the rat-king between his beady eyes! D&amp;D perfection. But maybe that's the point we're at already? The fighter's leap-attack would be the interruption to the ratmen's initiative victory, permissable in the situation because the fighter in question chose to hid behind the shield wall for that very purpose. Maybe this just needs to be enshrined in a few good "creedos" or something.<br/>\n<blockquote>Seems like maybe you'd want an option to attack the opponent's initiative, throwing them into disarray or something, instead of attacking their hitpoint pool.</blockquote>\nI like this. Consider it filed away under "<i>Iiiiinteresting..!</i>"\n<blockquote>+1 to Christopher's idea of attacking the opponent's initiative; pulling a maneuver that can disrupt the enemy's attention long enough to force a new init roll.  One thing I like in particular about this: it would give tactical benefit to really minor spells and legerdemain.  A sparkle of lights or a small sound off the enemy's left flank might be all you need to potentially throw him off his initiative.</blockquote>\n<i><b>INTERESTING..!</b></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_429542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429542/#Comment_429542" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T17:14:37+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  5:14PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I experimented with a melee mechanic that had some similarities with this intiative series concept.  Each player had a deck of playing cards, and the one with initiative played a card out; the opponent had to play a card in the same suit or suffer harm.  If the defender could play same suit as well as higher value, the iniative switched.  Obviously then, the attacker is best served by playing out their highest cards first, but in so doing they tend to run out of high value cards, while the defender only needs to play low value cards to stay out of trouble.  Sooner or later the attacker plays a card which the defender can beat, and so the intiative switches.  This is a fair way removed from D&amp;D initiative, but it may have some relevance in the way the switch over emerged naturally from mechanical decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429552/#Comment_429552" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T04:51:36+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  4:51AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, Contra!

So much depends on a good initiative!  <br/><br/>Eero and I discussed my next character. Potentially a homebrewed "Shield Bearer" class that has some robust custom shield rules - perhaps the retro-inclusion of what we'd recognise as a "Tank" roll in a MMORPG in low-level OSR play. <br/><br/>The current shield-rulings for Shield Bearers is being parsed as: <i>"Shield Bearers fighting defensively gain 4 AC against 'to hit' rolls until they are injured by an attack, at which point the shield is considered 'knocked aside' and the SB looses their shield's AC bonus until their next turn when they can elect to fight defensively again."</i><br/><br/>I can feel my routes in 4E coming through here, a bit, but I'm not sure that's a bad thing. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429629/#Comment_429629" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-19T08:24:45+00:00" title="March 19, 2014  8:24AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had gotten the impression that in the kind of OSR-play that Eero tended to engage in, this kind of character build stuff was de-emphasized? That characters started off very similar, and anyone could take advantage of, e.g., shield-fighting rules just by describing what their character was doing with a shield. Am I right, and this game is just different from the stuff that Eero has been describing previously, or have I misunderstood Eero's previous descriptions?<br/><br/>I know that at least one of Eero's campaigns had Initiations (feats) that were gained in-fiction, but were loosely tied to 1/level. But I had assumed these were not the main focus, as characters rarely attained even 5th level, and so can't have had very many of these.<br/><br/>Eero, perhaps you could talk more about how character abilities, feats, and progression have worked in games you have played? Some things that I would be interested in (answer as many as you like):\n<ol>\n<li>How important are feats?</li>\n<li>Do you need to get feats in order to do certain actions? Or can everyone do everything, but feats improve your efficacy?</li>\n<li>Who invents feats?</li>\n<li>If feats are only available in-fiction, how do stop the GM from having too much control over PCs' progressions? (Not that I am expecting the game to revolve around players plans for their character's progression. Rather, my concern is that by making the GM responsible for providing opportunities for all these advancements the GM is overloaded and ends up stunting PCs growth by failing to provide enough interesting feat-learning opportunities.)</li>\n<li>Are feats defined mechanically or fictionally, and then worked out mechanically in real use?

The Fighter could have access to an improved shield technique just because he's Fighter, the Servant by virtue of his skill-adaptation mechanic - be the servant of a great fighter, you learn to bear his arms and help him in a fight a bit.<br/><br/>As for the shield rule, as we discussed, I much prefer stronger shields than standard D&amp;D gives - that +1 AC is ridiculously piddly for such a central tool of war.<br/><br/>My currently favoured alternative of the ideas we discussed, for the Moldway context, is this: "A shield provides its user +2 AC against a single opponent, or +4 for Fighters. This bonus goes away if the opponent knocks the shield aside; a hit that strikes the shield does it, or a maneuver. The shield can be reinstated in any break in the exchange of blows - either maneuver for the chance, or reinstate at the end of the series at the latest if using that notion."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429631/#Comment_429631" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-19T08:33:32+00:00" title="March 19, 2014  8:33AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, the initiative system is cool.

Rather, we're re-investigating this subject matter from a fresh angle, with fresh interpersonal creative relationships in play. I would never have played with the Moldway rules, with demihuman classes in full and active use, were I going solely by my own inclinations. It's a fresh start!<br/><br/>Specifically, the Moldway chassis immediately makes much of my homebrew system inapplicable - it makes no sense whatsoever to implement many of those ideas in a context where we have HP-as-physical-damage, 10 second combat rounds, ability modifiers referenced off elaborate tables, and so on.<br/><br/>However, I do hold to certain precepts that I do not consider "mere game mechanics" - the actual system of ideal D&amp;D as I conceive it is unitary, even if there are a multitude of mechanical directions one could take. In this wider context I consider the idea of character builds an unhygienic practice; it is very important that players do not desire, and can not, predesign characters and armchair speculate about their supposed combat effectiveness as a replacement for actually playing the game. Allowing character builds was the single greatest flaw in 3rd edition to my mind.<br/><br/>Regarding your questions:<br/>1) Feats are as important as you make them. My theoretical answer is that D&amp;D needs some way of phrasing the idea that individual characters may have a fictional position that translates into mechanical hooks specific to them; the old way is to have these arrangements be entirely informal (you write in the back of your character sheet that your guy got special training/blessing/whatever and now can do thing X), while the new way is to have some formalistic rules and constraints and processes that encourage and balance these things, perhaps. My homebrew with its "initiations" is an example of the feat-like style, with certain formal processes that both ensure that you get cool stuff, and ensure that you don't get too much of it even if you try for it religiously, and ensures that you can't prebuild your character despite cool stuff existing and being known.<br/>2) I think that the 3rd edition discussion about feats "preventing" people from doing things is somewhat ancillary to me personally - I dont' think that the criticism of 3rd edition is that well-placed in this regard. It suffices for me to say that the system in play has failed if a character who fictionally speaking should be capable of something is not.<br/>3) Mechanical innovation is the purview of everybody in D&amp;D, I believe; specifically, D&amp;D has so much stuff that can be done, and should be done, at the table, that there simply isn't any need to fight over who gets to do what. If your GM is a control freak who can't live with the players being proactive and suggesting things, that's his problem - make him see that new Lego movie, perhaps it'll help <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>4) Because your play is not predicated on getting cool new feats in the first place, it is not a problem if the GM is somewhat stingy about it. Either the players push harder if they really, really need something (like I do on occasion in our current LotFP-based tabletop campaign arc - the GM is really not proactive about cool stuff in that one), or they make do without. It's a negotiation, as are most of the things in the game.<br/>5) I define a feat in fictional terms first, but I am only truly happy with feats that are also mechanically interesting and unique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429635/#Comment_429635" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-19T08:43:57+00:00" title="March 19, 2014  8:43AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, the initiative system is cool.

Even to the point where the later mix as flavor with the former to create these builds. I've seen Dex based tanks, where the character distracts the enemy but keeps avoiding his attacks, I've seen Tank Wizards, who use magical shields and magic armor to withstand greats amount of damage. I know this is probably going too far from D&amp;D roots, but do you think it would be viable to built class options around this instead?</blockquote>\nI dislike the video game combat role classifications personally because of their artificiality and resulting shallowness in their ability to speak about humanity; those roles mainly exist as an artifice of the way D&amp;D hitpoint rules and combat rounds were transferred into the digital medium. That does not prevent other people from working with them, of course, if they're considered creatively interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429645/#Comment_429645" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-19T13:00:33+00:00" title="March 19, 2014  1:00PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2014 1:47PM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In regards to the shield bearer concept, I'm very fine with this be parsed more generally through a certain brand of fighter or positioning rather than being a bold-letters <b>Character Class</b>.

(I've especially enjoyed playing with honest-to-god nice woodland elves first time in 15 years, and I'm also fond of that idea I had for a new direction with the Basic D&amp;D initiative system.) I feel that this bears emphasizing, as people don't seem to usually consider that something may well be a good thing even if e.g. I personally would not have made that choice. If I were a perfect monad, self-sufficient in everything, I wouldn't even play with you jerks.<br/><br/>As for the role of rules, that's pretty much my stance, as I've been trying to explain it: the actually interesting element of old school D&amp;D that is most relevant today is not necessarily in the specific mechanical conceits it happens to have (although there are interesting and highly relevant details there as well, among the should I say less successful notions), but rather in the systemic process behind those mechanics: the role that mechanics have in a rpg is conceptualized completely differently in older D&amp;D than it is in e.g. trad games, new D&amp;D or Forgite design. It's a fresh change of pace even if you've seen everything else already.<br/><br/>And yes, go and write about constructive play whenever you feel you're ready.

My character, Bodigon, was a mechanically a dwarf. However, due to the character's actions, he became: 1) a well-connected individual that was a major connector for recurring NPCs - the kind of guy you go to if you want to meet a guy; 2) a sort of de facto caravan leader for various expeditions or trade routes - I've spent more time negotiating retainer wages and trying to collect advance payment for requested goods than I have dungeon-delving; 3) a budding alchemist - having encountered some green slimes, he made a homebrewed powerful base to fight them, with plans to catch some green slime itself for the acidic property and finally getting an ever-warm hellhound heart.<br/><br/>None of this is a mechanical ability, but it is certainly a kind of character role. You get stuff like that not as part of chargen, though, but through play.<br/><br/>A minor problem with that is, Bodigon having died to a mule-thief, the new character I rolled up is naturally significantly less interesting than the one with all the actual play behind him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429664/#Comment_429664" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T03:06:08+00:00" title="March 20, 2014  3:06AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2014 3:06AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's the beauty of it, DW, you have all these ambitions and ideas generated from playing a character and then -WHAM- 0 HP!

My homebrew with its "initiations" is an example of the feat-like style, with certain formal processes that both ensure that you get cool stuff, and ensure that you don't get too much of it even if you try for it religiously, and ensures that you can't prebuild your character despite cool stuff existing and being known.</blockquote>\nThat's a helpful description of the aims here. One thing I wasn't sure about with your Initiations system was the 1/level rough limit. It seems to me that this is too limiting to describe all the different things that characters might be good at. Do you find with this limit that you also have a more informal character traits going on? So say my level 1 character has some "Healer" Initiation, but then it's also decided through play (say they ace a knowledge roll) that they know lots about currency. Also, in down time between the 1st and 2nd sessions they declare that they spend the time reading up on dragons. Does that character now get bonuses to rolls relating to currency and dragons? The first one seems too small for an Initiation. Perhaps the 2nd one would result in an Initiation, and they wouldn't be allowed to learn more things in between sessions until they've leveled up? Or perhaps there is just no mechanical benefit for these fictionally established facts? <br/><br/>How practically do you handle the nuances of fictional positioning of character expertise? I'm happy to hear about other approaches, not just the Initiation one, although that's what I'm most interested in - how Eero has brought some kind of structured/mechanical system to this problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429674/#Comment_429674" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T09:43:38+00:00" title="March 20, 2014  9:43AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ya, I get that the game you guys are playing on IRC is not "Eero's game".

I understood your questions in light of the recent IRC game discussion. That game differs in many ways from the mechanical approaches I took a couple years back for a tabletop game.\n<blockquote>One thing I wasn't sure about with your Initiations system was the 1/level rough limit. It seems to me that this is too limiting to describe all the different things that characters might be good at. Do you find with this limit that you also have a more informal character traits going on?</blockquote>\nYes. To be specific, the initiation system is predicated on "one big thing" structuration of fictional space, same as e.g. FATE aspects, D&amp;D feats or such: it presumes that each initiation, feat, or whatever we call them, is a fictionally pretty interesting, "big" thing. It does not suit well for codifying smaller details, even when those details might be locally pretty important.<br/><br/>A good example of this are languages: the way the initiation system would codify languages is by presuming whatever as the default case, and including an initiation such as "Multilingual", which might then e.g. allow the player to establish foreign languages equal character level that the character knows, writing them into a list under this initiation. This is obviously far from ideal in many situations (although that is a respectable initiation per se), as real linguistics are much more nuanced than that. It does, however, conform to the primary purpose of the initiation system - namely, control over the width and breadth of information.<br/><br/>(The point of the information control thing is simply that the notion of "feats" or "initiations" enables us to provide constructive limits to how much information we need to or may encode about our characters - at some point you no longer gain mechanical benefits from establishing more identity elements, because you don't have any more feat slots to dedicate to the purpose. The rule tells us what information to preserve and what to ignore, in other words. That's the formalistic nature of the rule in comparison to a completely organical approach, in which you can theoretically gain an infinite amount of mechanical advantage, as long as you can establish your character as a member of every cabal, ethnic group, school of philosophy or whatever else that ever might provide some advantage.)<br/><br/>Later on I've come to conclude that my system requires another step "down" from the big identity elements that the initiations offer. The game works well with these "small" things being informal and largely unwritten, but there are psychological and methodological advantages to keeping track of them as well. Some things are even practically mandatory to record, such as the exact list of spells your magic-user knows; these are really no more significant details than what languages your character knows, or whether or not he's read a book about dragons, but you can see how it'd be difficult to play the game if you didn't track whether or not your character knows Magic Missile.<br/><br/>My latter-days solution to recording this sort of "chaff" about character has been a white space in the character sheet called "Notes" or "Details", and an instruction to the players to write down whatever things that they desire to maintain as records; such records will then form compelling evidence in the matter later on, should it come up for some reason. In other words, I punt the problem of what's important and what's not to the players, and let them act as their own curators. Some prefer lean character spec where they rely on oral tradition ("Hey, we found out ten sessions back that my character speaks this one language"), while others fill their sheet with minute scrawling about the most inconsequential details in the hopes of garnering some advantage from it down the road. Very similar to how inventory and encumbrance are handled, in fact.<br/><br/>With this principle in place, and a clear delineation between the properly feat-slotted things and inconsequential "chaff", I've found it easy to be more liberal with the latter. Like, your character reads a book about dragons, hey you get +2 for dragon-lore checks - and it doesn't necessarily have to be just this one check. Perhaps that's something you'll just remember for this adventure and ignore later, or maybe you'll write it down. Maybe you'll stop writing them down after the tenth one, and just trust in that you'll find it easy enough to establish this condition anew if and when you actually need it <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>My latter-days mechanical border-control "initiations" and "chaff" has pretty much focused on dropping some less useful initiations and making them into incidental details instead. This particularly goes for the skill initiation - an individual skill, even one classically used by adventurers, is just too boring to be a full-blown initiation most of the time. Players still can get that "Expert acrobat" initiation if they really want it, and they'll get that bonus die for it; however, they could just write it down in their chaff that they used to be an acrobat, and rely on the GM applying that as a modifier to checks or whatever.<br/><br/>One important formalistic feature of the chaff is that the chaff can't have stable mechanical associations, by the way: you can write in your chaff that you used to be an acrobat (or that you know a language, or a spell, or are a member of the local Rotary chapter), but you can't write down mechanical consequences of this: if your feature is so special, specific, interesting and important that you need to have guaranteed mechanical representation for it, then that'll need to be an initiation instead. The chaff is basically just fictional positioning detail that's been given extra weight by writing it down.<br/><br/>The chaff is at this point a bit too green a concept for me to be entirely certain where it goes - I should play actively with the system to find out, and that's not been the case for a while now, as I've been here in Helsinki playing with LotFP instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429675/#Comment_429675" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T09:58:53+00:00" title="March 20, 2014  9:58AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, that's helpful - I had basically been thinking along the same lines.

Amendments to the procedure can come from all sides.<br/>*Writing It Down is important as a player, less so as a DM. <br/><br/>Eero will now post telling me that (a) these principals aren't anything like what he's doing and (b) you can't shorten lengthy mental processes down into snappy little sentences.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429687/#Comment_429687" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T04:28:17+00:00" title="March 21, 2014  4:28AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that looks basically good to me. I would add that "letting go of intentionality" is something you need to do as a GM, if you're living under the impression that it is your task to predesign what the game will become. This is different from goal-oriented, intentional play, which should very much be an emphasis: in my eyes one of the biggest differences between the player role in old school D&amp;D and the player role in traditional roleplaying games is the presumption of intentionality in D&amp;D: the game assumes, rewards and supports players forming goals and striving for them. The game's procedures reflect this: the GM can do almost nothing, while the players can do almost anything, when it comes to actually initiating action. If the players aren't being intentional, if they just twitch randomly and spout nonsense at the game table, then that's the quality of your game right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429689/#Comment_429689" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T07:47:24+00:00" title="March 21, 2014  7:47AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2014 7:50AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to think of it as the DM being a computer (in both ancient and modern senses) with actually very few actions to perform (aside from the ability to wax lyrical about rose-bushes as a form of idling activity), but the DM-computer has to be operated by the players.

In Eero's vision of old-school D&amp;D (and I'd say this is probably a common one among OSR group and goes way back to the roots of the hobby), the GM provides the material for play (in the form of adventure hooks, spouting off about rosebushes, and the like) and negotiates outcomes to actions, but it's entirely the players who drive the action forward.<br/><br/>The players' job is to initiate action and decide on the pace of play. The GM responds to that and resolves actions as they are presented to her, quite in contrast to many more modern games, where the GM is a very active role and develops the story, which players then respond to (e.g. Sorcerer's Bangs). The idea that the GM is a "referee" is a very apt analogy here: not an initiator but a negotiator and resolver. The players control the pace of the game by the way they interact with the GM. (An important point to remember if the game seems to be stalling or moving along too slowly for your liking; for this reason, in many groups, an ability to generate active and even reckless play is considered to be a valuable player quality, simply because it makes the game exciting. Of course, balancing that against smart tactical decisions is always a challenge: maybe <i>the</i> biggest challenge for a player in this style, in fact.)<br/><br/>So the players engage with the GM and the challenges of play at a pace of their choosing, and the GM responds to that by resolving their actions and giving them answers at the appropriate pace. (Note that this is not necessarily related to the fictional pace of events: you could gloss over the events of two days in a single roll, and you could spend 20 minutes debating the details of how your character tumbles down the stairs in the seconds before the oil is set on fire.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429701/#Comment_429701" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T11:20:59+00:00" title="March 21, 2014 11:20AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nicely said, Paul.

I would be surprised if these simple steps didn't fix the recruitment and scheduling difficulties. Obvious, really - of course we're having trouble getting a quorum of players if we're basically relying on people stumbling to the chat at the right time by accident. I don't think anybody expect Paul, Daumantas, Mike and myself even knew about yesterday's session, and of those both Daumantas and Paul showed up after Mike had already left <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/>Speaking of which, Daumantas has been making noises about playing more tonight or tomorrow. As it happens, my plans for tonight fell through, so I'll be available.<br/><br/>I should clarify that the above is an observation and a recipe, not particularly a call to action; if I felt strongly about it, I would do the above myself. As you know, I technically speaking have plenty of other stuff to do as well, so I'm relatively agnostic about more play - I have enjoyed the sessions so far quite a bit, and would be interested in seeing more, but not enough to particularly worry about when or whether there is another session in the near future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430025/#Comment_430025" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-26T10:21:33+00:00" title="March 26, 2014 10:21AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been following along with this thread since the beginning, and just as an example of how unclear things are to those of us who haven't joined in, I'm not sure if you're gaming in IRC or using an IRC channel as a staging place and then taking it to videochat or what.

(Not that I apply that rule literally - it should obviously depend on the level of maintenance and nature of the "trap" how likely it is to go off on you.) I was mostly intrigued yesterday by the realization that there is no trap-detection or general awareness check of any sort in the Moldway procedure - if you don't say that your character is being careful, and the trap triggers on you, it's an automatic hit and time for saving throws.<br/><br/>Compared to rules that allow you a dice roll to detect or avoid a trap, the Moldway system is quite unforgiving about traps. (Especially and specifically compared to things like combat: your character does not generally speaking just impale himself on the opponent's weapon if you don't explicitly declare a dodge.) Basically the only credible defense you have is explicit fictional positioning: you've gotta say that you're watching out for traps, for the assumed default state of your character is optimistic idiocy. Of course the "watching" might not help much, either, as the only kind of watching the system knows about is taking entire Turns at a time to search things for that piddly 1/6 chance to find stuff.<br/><br/>My own philosophy of mechanization for D&amp;D generally runs towards more consistency in the player/character relationship, which usually means assuming somewhat more character autonomy - as I often say, the player is the character's superego, not the ego, and definitely not the acting mind. If he were, the character would forget to bring food, water and torches - heck, he'd probably forget to breathe, considering players <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Sometimes this spirit of "you're not your character and we cannot have you micromanaging his farts" makes life easier for the players, such as when I roll various wits dice to see if the character might have realized to do something the player didn't explicitly say, such as be on the lookout for traps. Other times it increases the challenge, as the player can't be assumed to have total control over the character's feelings, either, and therefore I find it legit to have players roll about things like fear, exhaustion, boredom, lust, and such, which all might cause the character to act against player desire when his control relaxes. I suppose I like to have the characters be a bit more like hapless lemmings than a glove the player wears <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430230/#Comment_430230" name="Item_179" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T12:07:12+00:00" title="March 29, 2014 12:07PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My own tastes run that way, too, Eero.

I asked this in more detail in the other thread, but it probably makes more sense to talk about it here.<br/><br/>How much do you prep as the GM for a game like this? Clearly, once the game is rolling, and things have been established, the work required drops significantly and becomes rather player-driven. But in the beginning, given your interest in offering multiple plot hooks, how much do you bring to the table right off the bat, and how much can be improvised as you go along? Do you have a 'stable' of modules on hand, for example, and just look for excuses to drop them in to the gameworld, or other techniques?<br/><br/>2. On a related topic: you have explained that your own vision of D&amp;D fantasy here is somewhat more "realistic", and draws more on real-world history and less on D&amp;D tropes (like Elves and Orcs and magic swords). Given that, how do you justify the existence of horrible monsters, and bizarre dungeon environments? Is it all handwaved away, or is there a premise which is used to explain how a group of adventurers walking down the road can run into some supernatural beast, and why there are caverns full of traps, monsters, and treasure (and, more to the point, in several locations near wherever the characters turn out to be)? How do you approach this, and how much of it is thought through in detail, as opposed to just ignored as one of the requirements for play?<br/><br/>3. On telegraphing difficulty to the players.<br/><br/>When something is potentially difficult and/or dangerous, we have to carefully consider how it's presented to the players. Is it obvious that the danger is great, or should it "look" the same as the rest of the world, and or is this a case of "the players will find out about it the hard way"?<br/><br/>I can see this being an important issue in two regards:<br/><br/>a) When the players are presented with adventure hooks, how much do they know about the danger involved? Is it up to them to do investigate and pick up information, and, if so, how hard is it to do, how much is given away freely, and how much must be fought for? <br/><br/>In our IRC game thus far, adventure hooks are presented more in terms of Colour (Hey, there's something about Love, and a sleeping princess! Hey, some halflings want an escort!), and the players following up on them can only guess at the level of danger/reward involved. How much effort do you put into telegraphing these elements to the players, and how much do you let them just figure it out slowly over time ("Ok, we've lost two parties in that cavern.... maybe we'll leave it alone until we've leveled up significantly")?<br/><br/>I know that in some forms of hex crawl-style games, there's an expectation that things get more dangerous based on their location (e.g. the further away from "base camp", the more dangerous the adventures might be). Is there anything like this in your games?<br/><br/>b) In a smaller scale, when dealing with scary or dangerous stuff in a dungeon (for example), you often to get more information from the players. Someone wants to fool around with the lever that you secretly know is connected to a deathtrap - you'll probably want to know what, exactly, the character is doing with that lever, and is there any chance they might pull it, accidentally or deliberately?<br/><br/>In this kind of situation, asking for more details could be seen as telegraphing potential danger to the player. ("These skeletons are potentially a threat, not just Colour, so I'm asking you in great detail about just how you approach them.")<br/><br/>Do you see this as potentially problematic or not? How do you deal with it in play? I've been trying to figure it out in our game, but I don't quite have a handle on your particularly approach to this (potential) problem just yet.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430351/#Comment_430351" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T14:06:28+00:00" title="March 31, 2014  2:06PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1.

For example, this IRC game is pretty light-weight stuff in that I'm not responsible for much in there; the setting is a joint project that relies on constructively interpreting Moldway, for example. Consequently my prep has pretty much consisted of moving a few key adventure modules closer to hand's reach in case they come up in play. I've refreshed myself a little bit about what adventures I have in my library, so I can select things to highlight in adventure hooks.<br/><br/>Note that the reason for why I can go essentially "no prep" here is in the hidden, more general preparation: I have previously done work to become a reasonably skilled improviser with an interesting and literarily varied imagination, I have come to a peace with myself regarding how D&amp;D works, and I have read through a sufficient number of adventures so I can have something to offer a selection from. I did none of these things as prep for this particular campaign, so they sort of don't count, though.<br/><br/>The other extreme in terms of prep is an ambitious, uniquely colorful campaign where you create all the material yourself, and rely on consistent techniques over the entire campaign. For an example of what that might look like, consider Carcosa or Vornheim - those are based on real campaigns prepped by their respective authors, and successfully played. They're entire books. You can spend quite a while preparing for a campaign if you want to achieve something specific that can't be done by improvising and parsing together random materials.\n<blockquote>Eero, 2. On a related topic: you have explained that your own vision of D&amp;D fantasy here is somewhat more "realistic", and draws more on real-world history and less on D&amp;D tropes (like Elves and Orcs and magic swords).

How do you approach this, and how much of it is thought through in detail, as opposed to just ignored as one of the requirements for play?</blockquote>\nWell, this depends on the setting. I mean, my D&amp;D is not solely about historical fantasy, that just happens to be what we've been rocking recently around here.<br/><br/>For the historical fantasy setting, though, I think that the key hangup, at least for me personally, is in how to imagine a real kind of world that is not changed into something altogether different by the presence of magic and monsters. (This exact issue might not be your big issue, but for me it's like 80% of the challenge of the genre - once I resolve this, I've got the rest in the bag as well.) How is it that we have this adventure module with genuine non-human lizard people, and still the Roman church refutes the existence of non-humans?<br/><br/>My answer to making this work has been strict localism, and willingness to let the PCs change the setting. The first of those principles, localism, means that nothing in the world except my own preconceptions forces some supernatural phenomenon to be successful in becoming ubiquitous in the milieu. Sure there might be wizards, but who's to say that they're important to the world at large? Clearly they're not, as if they were, the world would be a different place! Logical application of localism ends up with the weirdness coming up in a sort of pulp fiction manner: there is this one village full of fish-people here in this distant place on the coast, but it never gets into any reputable newspapers, and even if it does, it'll just be explained according to the prevailing world-view.<br/><br/>As for that second principle: it might be the case that the historical fantasy setting can't withstand the action of the player characters, and the setting might very quickly slip towards the fantastic. The traditional gaming answer to this is to use GM fiat of various flavours to protect the nice setting with the knights and princesses in their castles; my answer has been to embrace the change. When the ambiguously dead general succeeded in invoking Satan and the dead rose in Northern Italy, you can fucking believe that the world (or Europe, at least) changed overnight. Of course two months later the Pope <i>still</i> didn't quite take the news entirely seriously, but most anybody who actually had a clue did.<br/><br/>So I guess my answer, as regards the genre of historical fantasy, is to treat every fantasy element like it was a Solomon Kane story, and if and when the players succeed in "breaking the masquerade", by all means let them. The fact that the world has managed to remain relatively mundane for the last two millenia (or at least the people right now think that it has; my historical fantasy is often very ambiguous about this veil of normalcy that ordinary people enjoy) doesn't have to mean that it will withstand the epic scale on which PCs tend to screw up.\n<blockquote>3. On telegraphing difficulty to the players.</blockquote>\nThis is a good question. My theoretical answer is that we provide or withhold difficulty data for three reasons:<br/>a) To make play actually occur; this is "constructive unrealism", one might say - the medium just forces us to be practical at times.<br/>b) To negotiate challenges; without difficulty information players might not be willing to commit to an adventure, and without commitment there is no challenge.<br/>c) To provide legitimate information that characters should reasonably get, considering their maneuvers.<br/><br/>Note that I say "provide or withhold" because the way I see it, these are just two sides of the same coin: sometimes you have to reveal or hide something for practical reasons, sometimes you have to reveal or hide something to make the challenge work, sometimes you have to reveal or hide something because of player maneuvers.<br/><br/>From your musings it sounds to me like you're most concerned with my category "a", the information that has to be revealed for reasons of the medium. It is certainly true that on occasion you are forced to telegraph vague things to the players by the mere processes of play. For example, a player making a search check can tell that they succeeded or failed, and can thus distinguish between "there is nothing here" and "you haven't found anything yet". This kind of thing can be improved upon by choosing better or different procedures - some GMs routinely roll search checks themself, for example, so the players don't know whether their search is unsuccessful or if there's just nothing to be found there. It is a choice of mechanical implementation to strike the compromise you desire between different values, such as ease of handling, player psychology, robust treatment of fiction, and so on.<br/><br/>The other facet you mention is about how much the players should get in negotiating a challenge. I think that they should get as much as they settle for, as long as the adventure is still legit, and there is a reasonable channel of information. What I mean by that last one is that black boxes are black boxes; if that mausoleum has never been opened since it was closed a millenium back, who's gonna tell you about what's in there? If you can't name a credible information source, then you've got a black box, and it's up to you whether you want to open it or not.<br/><br/>I hope that the pool adventure from yesterday demonstrates in hindsight the above principles: I'm willing to part with information the players want, information they need, and information that is reasonable available in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430366/#Comment_430366" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-31T22:56:44+00:00" title="March 31, 2014 10:56PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Excellent answers, as usual.

For instance, someone crossing a bridge without a trap on it might just say, "I cross the bridge", and the GM is free to carry on describing what's on the other side. However, if the GM knows there's a trap on the left-hand side of the bridge, he or she should logically ask the player: "Hang on, are you walking on the left, or on the right?" This can potentially "clue in" the player to the existence of danger (or opportunity, at the very least). How do you approach this aspect of play?

I read a bunch of adventure modules for other reasons (for my webstore, and academic curiousity) during the preceding year, so didn't need to reread them to start play. Most time was spent in doing the geography, as I developed the hex wilderness and locations of adventures in it in advance. I spent maybe 4-8 hours in prep before the first session in enumerating the adventures and developing the map, and then about the same twice or thrice more later on when expanding into new theaters of operation (that required new geography and partially new adventure selections).\n<blockquote>2.

This process of affirmation may indeed clue the players in on there being something awry, but it's also sort of too late for them to anything about it at that point; there is technical meaning to shouting in a quick "I back away!" or something of the sort, as it illustrates the mentality of the character, and his ability to react quickly and decisively, but it's not a panacea that'll automatically save you, because when the GM needs to ask you're presumably already in the deep of it.<br/><br/>If a player tries to contest walking into a trap due to the GM introducing it in the wrong order somehow from player viewpoint, then I just patiently go over the fictional sequence of events at hand, and have the player judge it with me: how is your character actually making any choices here, or could it be the case that you're rapidly reacting to meta concerns, such as your knowing what just now happened to this other character around the corner? The vast majority of players will be <i>reasonably</i> fair when faced with such a Socratic method, and I personally feel like my hands are somewhat tied from doing anything more than insist forcefully on my own opinion; if a player is absolutely committed to having their own character live unreasonably, the only recourse I have is to state the situation clearly to the floor (the group, that is), declare my opinion that the player is in my opinion not attempting to achieve a good faith realistic resolution, and then let them have their way. After that a lot depends on the nature of the creative relationship - could range from continuing play with the rest of the group sort of mocking the pisshead subtextually for being unwilling to take the game like an adult (sort of "he's playing with training wheels" attitude), to being understanding and accomodating towards the child among the group, to the player being subtly shamed so that they'll be very keen to prove their fairness in the future.<br/><br/>To be clear, those last parts of that negotiation progression are <i>extremely rare</i>, I have had to give up on fictional positioning negotiations like that for real like one time in a thousand resolution situations, between several scores of players. It is much more common for it to be the case that once I've explained how I think the situation went, what I thought the player had voiced as their action, and the player does the same, that we find that we have reasonable grounds for compromise. It is definitely the case that the GM's personal control mania or tendency towards taking sides is a much, much bigger potential issue in these discussions than a player being genuinely unwilling to have their character face the consequences of a fair scenario. (A fair scenario is one where the fictional event is clearly a valid possibility to occur, and the process of resolution is being fair.) The key is to recognize that how the player perceives the game matters <i>too</i>, and even if you feel like they had fair warning and a beat to react to it, it's possible that their attention was distracted, or yours was, and you're simply seeing the situation in different light. The mature individual makes way and compromises, instead of trying to enforce absolutely perfect obedience to his own vision for the sake of polishing your authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430369/#Comment_430369" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T00:38:43+00:00" title="April  1, 2014 12:38AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Considering the IRC game, we haven't had any real big to-dos of this nature (disagreements about what is happening), but I think that if you think back you might be able to remember some small situation where something harsh is going on and I'm leading the process of fiction discovery. I think that I generally tend to go slower and have the players affirm the legitimacy of the choices more when the stakes are higher. For example, when we were doing the stairway traps in the pseudodragon adventure, I asked the players explicitly if they thought that we should consider some specific mechanical constraints in Moldway that I seemed to be ignoring, and only once nobody contested my call, had the trap take effect to lethal consequence. In other words, I first procured player agreement to the fact that the character had in fact stepped on the trap unassuming, and only then progressed to revealing the exact effects of the trap.<br/><br/>This kind of approach obviously relies on a certain basic level of creative cooperation skills or (alternatively) trust among the group; I've had players who have stewed uncomfortably at the table due to personal self-worth issues, for example, which make them unable to see that their difficulties in the game might be in part because they don't assert their rights and own understanding about situations strongly enough. This in turn leaves them sort of in a potential position to be a GM punching bag, as the GM does make human errors, and he doesn't have the time to make sure even players who don't defend themselves are treated fairly. The game's nature is such that you are at times your own legal counsel, although most good groups tend to have at least one or two players who are interested enough in the process qua process that they'll counsel everybody else about precedent, positioning and possible arguments in their favour (or against them, as the case might be). It's not a magically perfect system, though, so it's possible for the table dynamic in a certain session to be such that a wise GM paddles backwards especially much, paying particular attention to drawing out genuine player concord and cooperation on slaughtering their characters in amusing ways. The goal of the process is not to have dead characters, but rather to have the players enthusiastically agreeing with you about how fair and legit even the most astounding outcomes in the game have been. That goes for both the horrible and the heroic outcomes - you need everything to be legit in the eyes of the group for the play to be real.<br/><br/>(With players who can never accept that bad things happen to their own characters and smile about it because it happened legitimately according to the spirit of the game, the only choice in the long run is not to play, as they will only be disappointed by my GMing, and I will be disappointed by their lack of intellectual honesty. Asking about such would be akin to asking about the guy who can't play tennis because from their viewpoint it's ultimately all about bullying the others into accepting their wide balls as being in. I have met a few people who are fundamentally opposed to high stakes gamism, and we simply don't play games like this together.)<br/><br/>Anyway, as you can see from my long explanation of seeking mutually guaranteed concord in a situation with high stakes, I see your original question more in terms of creative agenda cooperation than as a technical matter; I'll just go as slow as needs be, have my GM judgements verified as explicitly as needs be, and listen to complaints as long as needs be for there to emerge a true consensus that your character deserved to fall off that bridge. If that consensus doesn't emerge, odds are that your character doesn't fall off the bridge, and either I forgive you because you had good cause to complain, or I'll dislike you for being so childish about it. More likely though we'll just agree that in the interest of brevity you'll acknowledge that I'm not fundamentally wrong and the game process is basically right, you get an extra Dex check to make sure no local injustice has occured, and then play proceeds.<br/><br/>In the end this entire process doesn't really care massively about the GM signalling danger, because at the point he's signalling it by asking for extra rolls or whatever, character intent is usually already locked down. Of course some players are more subtle about reading GM signs than others, but the GM just needs to train themself to signal less, and the players need to play more fair, so that the true and realistic character intent gets room to breathe. If you always react to the GM asking about marching order by having your character leap to the side, you'll either train the GM to give false alarms (to discourage you from over-reacting), or train the GM to argue more strenuously against choices predicated upon meta-information (can't jump aside without fictional signals of danger), or you actually succeed and have broken the game by making it impossible for your character to ever fall victim to marching order related dangers - congratulations, you lost the game by making it so that your character and tactical choices are no longer being evaluated fairly within the fiction (a result very much like winning in Chess by taking so long to move that the other player goes home).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430371/#Comment_430371" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T02:17:30+00:00" title="April  1, 2014  2:17AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Avidly taking notes here... or at least attempting to internalise for mental regurgitation next I'm at table.

It's also not a particularly counseling position, or particularly nurturing of the other players; when you're the caller, or party leader, your attention is always on moving the decision-making process on, getting the game to move quickly forward, and getting results. Doing that, you don't really have time to worry about whether the other players are carrying their end - in my experience the caller is just about the last person after the GM who's likely to notice when a player is e.g. zoning out and not paying attention. D&amp;D is a game where it is very easy to ignore the disinterest of other players, in this way.<br/><br/>Note that the caller is not a relevant role in crisis situations, where one might need legal advocacy or other types of detail-oriented play; the caller is most useful and relevant in getting the game through the routine events of environment exploration, whether dungeon or hex crawling. When a special situation unfolds, the caller is not relevant (the tactical leader of the party might still be, if the party has good organization), as every player is queried for their actions in turn, and everybody's moment to moment contribution matters independently.<br/><br/>In my tabletop play the caller is used routinely, although we call him the "tactical leader" (roughly, that's a translation from Finnish). His task is essentially to handle the routines so everybody else can lean back with a slice of pizza and observe the developments. In our tabletop sessions over the last winter I've often been the strategic leadership, while Peitsa (familiar from the IRC channel) has been the tactical lead. Our local circle has a bunch of other capable tactical leaders, so the roles are and can be switched around depending on who's playing and what everybody's inspired to do.<br/><br/>As for distribution of the workload, I personally think that there are many possibilities in D&amp;D in this regard, and from what I've seen and heard of other people's play, it seems that they regularly choose to distribute workloads less than they could. The caller isn't really a relevant thing here (Mike sounds like he's a bit excited about the caller, in fact, the way he tries to fit him into situations that have nothing to do with tactical dungeon task flow) per se, as it's a role used in routines of play, but there are other roles that are important to fluid play and sharing the workload. My own favourite is the "logistics manager" or "NCO", who centralizes supply management and can buy and sell routine materials to the party, thus freeing up the GM from answering questions like "what does a lantern cost" or "can I buy chain mail in this town".<br/><br/>My ideal for a D&amp;D crew these days consists of experienced players who work efficiently together and have established, eager experts running the tasks of strategic lead, tactical lead, logistics and mapping/secretarial. Often these roles are combined in practice, especially as it seems to be rare to have a team with more than two or three active and competent players. A good team of players can reduce the GM bottleneck considerably, as a GM who can trust the team to take care of routine matters can focus on the interesting stuff more. And of course such a team gets more done per unit of play, and to a greater degree of quality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430385/#Comment_430385" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T09:30:37+00:00" title="April  1, 2014  9:30AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My own favourite is the "logistics manager" or "NCO", who centralizes supply management and can buy and sell routine materials to the party, thus freeing up the GM from answering questions like "what does a lantern cost" or "can I buy chain mail in this town".</blockquote>\nI know there was some interest in some sea-hex crawling this weekend. When I've been doing that, I explicitly ask the players to appoint a whole bunch of roles along these lines. Some are best handled by experienced players, but some are a great ways for low level people to get in the game too. We have the boatswain as logistics manager, some combination of captain and mate as strategic and tactical callers and often negotiator and morale checker, a lookout who establishes direction and distance and other stakes for encounters as well as weather, a steersperson/coxswain who has to make constitution checks if you want to pull advanced maneuvers and also tracks rower endurance in long engagements, etc.<br/><br/>Usually nowadays there's someone who's been transformed into a wind or water elemental to make the boat faster too. Last night it was a level one dwarf who went mad in a spree of boat-crushing and they had to leave him after he took their enemies' treasures to the deeps with him.<br/><br/>Having a job is fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430410/#Comment_430410" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-02T05:25:56+00:00" title="April  2, 2014  5:25AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Eero, this discussion came up a little bit last night on IRC about whether goblins are people or monsters.

For example, in our big campaign, set in a "fantasy-Europe" essentially similar to that in Ars Magica and such, it is simply not possible to have <i>tribal</i> monster goblin like TSR does - it's just too weird to have like this intelligent non-human civilization living liminated with human communities, while also pretending like this is the Netherlands in the 16th century. So in that kind of context you gotta split the TSR goblin in twain: all adventures where goblins are tribes that live in ruins or dungeons become encounters with "human goblins", essentially forest-living ethnic groups of humans; goblins that come up in mystical, magical, folkloric contexts can then be "real" goblins of the fairy tales.<br/><br/>For a different campaign where it's cool to have green pseudohumans hanging around in broad daylight it might well be perfectly sensible to use the Gygaxian goblin concept. There is certain grandeur and majesty in the Greyhawk vision, really - I could see myself running it at some point, but I would go all in with it in that case, making it all about the ethnic cleansing and racial wars and so on. (If that sounds strange, you should read up on what Greyhawk is like. Topic for another day, no doubt.)<br/><br/>I should note that Mike is an originalist of sorts regarding D&amp;D, from what we've discussed - he seems to derive some sort of pleasure from seemingly arbitrary aesthetic choices like "D&amp;D is about dungeons" and "you gotta be after golden treasure for it to be D&amp;D" - and apparently, "greenskins gotta be monsters or it all falls apart". Needless to say, I don't agree with him on any of these points.<br/><br/>(And because this is the Internet, I should note that I have no problem whatsoever with disagreeing with Mike. I'm adult enough to, you know, accept that not everybody wants the same exact things all the time that I do. Aesthetic judgements are allowed to differ, at least in polite society. I would feel Mike's D&amp;D constraining and a bit less than it has potential to be, the way it limits itself artificially to a strict set of dungeoneering challenges, but that's no judgement on the man himself.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430412/#Comment_430412" name="Item_191" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-02T06:02:35+00:00" title="April  2, 2014  6:02AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2014 6:11AM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's disingenuous to say I feel <i>strongly</i> about whether Goblins are sympathetic or not, it's just that the Finnish game-culture that's agreed that Goblins are this European aboriginal People (or at least this is how I understand their usage here), who are human for all extents and purposes except in their treatment by the White Man, and this strikes me as a radical creative departure from the norm.

Mostly this is to lurk in caves, assault intruders and be associated with a random amount of gold. <br/><br/>Goblins are the arch-perpetrators of this behaviour (or at least are regulars on Wandering Monster tables universally) and have been enshrined in our culture as a subterranean-dwelling, diminutive race of mischievous, green humanoids that are motivated by violence and gold (which, interestingly, is the default motivation for everything in OS D&amp;D...).<br/><br/>This is a longwinded way of saying that I, personally, don't envision Goblins. Gygax envisions Goblins, I read Gygax. The reading is important. I want to try examine what those dudes were thinking about in, like, an art history/anthropological sense. I'm a nerd, I like words. The OSR has this approach in regard to rules ("playing like it was really played!") but I'm interested in what the text implies about the setting ("seeing like it was really seen!"). Sure, this would be easier if I weren't just going off the B/X books (which are skimpy on the detail), but that restriction is part of the...fun? Challenge? <br/><br/>Hm, not sure I actually feel as strongly as the above might imply about all this. I'm just trying to avoid bringing my own setting intentions into my reading of the text. If Moldvay implies bitter and eternal race-war, I gotta face that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430421/#Comment_430421" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-02T09:01:35+00:00" title="April  2, 2014  9:01AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An important amedum here, before the trail begins, is that I'm not against the Finnish School of Goblins at all.

Chaos\u201d-style unproblematic depictions of the monstrous. But my solution is to exclusively use fairy-tale goblins. My goblins do not have society, they only have games and transparently monstrous imitation. My goblins are spontaneously generated from the earth to repel intruders in the fiction as well as in the mechanics (in wandering monster checks).<br/><br/>If I want a tribe of humans I use a tribe of humans (and I feel strongly that this tbh the most ethical choice here but I don't want to ruin the conversation, that's my politics, informed by my own relationship with indigenous people and the political theory that they have produced).<br/><br/>I am super-interested in the colonialist assumptions of D&amp;D (in the wild landscape, the general store, etc) and to me the OSR, the act of peeling back this published material that has built up where D&amp;D references mostly other derivatives of D&amp;D, is a really powerful tool for examining some power structures in the culture that produced it. The spaces between our viewpoints are indicative of that, too\u2014I think all three of them engage that material quite directly.<br/><br/>PS: it is possible that either of you may feel that I am not describing or do not understand your positions properly, I don't want to pretend to be representing them fully in this comparison<br/><br/>PPS: I also allow my players a lot of authorship of the setting through character creation, so that we get a lot of creative problem-solving happening when they re-introduced received D&amp;Disms, scottish dwarfs or tall wise elves rather than my Midsummer Nights' Dream/Medieval Green Men versions, but I like that a lot<br/><br/>PPPS: I keep thinking of things! I had a good discussion on Monday where some newish players kept asking me how the goblins ship <em>worked</em> given that I had described it as being full of holes and completely falling to bits but yet it was actually a little bit faster than a similarly-designed human ship. I started with "you know, goblins are like that" and continued with "there's a bathtub on the side of it, a bit of siding from a house" and a little more of "goblins are like that" and I think we got somewhere in the end. Goblin ships don't work, that's the whole idea!

No monster, for example, needs a light source to see in the dungeon. Even human bandits. And dungeon doors always open for them despite being locked/jammed for the players. The implication is that, textually, things really do spring supernaturally out of the dungeon to assault the players. I totally express this in the same terms you do, Adam. Or, at least, I think I do. <br/><br/>What is a monster? <br/><br/><i>"Any creature that is not a player character is called a monster. Monsters may be friendly or unfriendly, wild or tame, normal beast or fantastic."</i> - B/X B29. <br/><br/>Depending on which Goblin you meet, the encounter might be an incredibly friendly one - this idea that being a monster is a bad thing to be in its own right is questionable when you can have a warm, Tolkieny interaction with just about everything.<br/><br/> Monster, in my game-head, isn't a purgative title, it's a category of... existence? Yes, yes, I realise this definition also includes innocent human NPCs. And, yes, it's problematic, but I have to roll with the deconstruction: is there a subtext here about human nature/heroic privilege, or just a misstatement that's not that useful? The idea that killing normal humans grants as much XP as a goblin speaks loudly about how Gygax is trying to model the world and direct our conduct in it... or not direct, rather - we are free moral agents, or free at least to be Chaotic, Neutral or Lawful. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I keep on about textuality. I'd like to say that it's not guiding me strictly in the actual running of the Greysands campaign, there it's all about communication and finding the path through with the rest of the table - which is <i>totally</i> my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">jam</span>.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430450/#Comment_430450" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-02T17:13:10+00:00" title="April  2, 2014  5:13PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2014 5:13PM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may be somewhat relieved to know that the same blurry dilemma exists on the opposite end of the spectrum.

I mean, I'm totally on board fairy tale goblins, as I think my answer to Christopher's question indicated; it's just that this commitment does nothing for me, or you, if there are actual traditional D&amp;D dungeon adventure modules at the table!<br/><br/>How so? Why, have you guys ever read or played these things? (That's a partially serious question - many people play extensive D&amp;D without using a lot in the way of adventure modules, relying on their own material instead.) There are like 60 goblins in this dungeon, some in the random encounter tables, some scattered in specific rooms. One room has 8 warrior goblins (with spears or even swords), in another one there is a goblin kitchen pit. In one there are all the children, women and oldies, behind a locked door to be safe from adventurers. In one room is the shaman with some guards and the tribal treasure, in another a tribal king on his throne. That's what a traditional D&amp;D goblin's usage looks like in actual adventure modules, the majority of the time. (Thinking of "Dyson's Delve" and "Tomb of the Iron God" here specifically, but this is a strong trend since the TSR days.) That's the "Gygaxian goblin", in my experience - and I've spent much, much more time with adventure modules than I've done reading monster manuals.<br/><br/>When you're using something like that, a strict fairy tale interpretation of what that little word "goblin" means is not gonna cut it. Those are a primitive people of some sort, just looking at what they're doing in the adventure module and what they have, no way around it. The question is just whether I'm going to make them a non-human intelligent species of creatures fundamentally tainted by evil, or a slightly exotic human ethnicity, or what - I can't just make that civilization disappear and replace it with like rhyming behaviours, stealing babies, having highly magical fae nobility, and doing everything backwards in amusing, magical ways without extensively rewriting that adventure module.<br/><br/>(D&amp;D incidentally has plenty of monsters that are of somewhat later derivation than the classic "goblin" and other pseudohuman monsters, and that are intended to bring that folklore swing into the game. If you'll look at the monster manual, the various redcaps, gnomes and other fairy fellers and little people are pretty clearly intended to be used when you want to have a mysterious encounter with a singular weird forest fae who'll steal your hat and your cow and bites you in the ankles when you try to run after it. The common goblin is incredibly prosaic in comparison.)<br/><br/>In other contexts, when I've used adventures that make goblins more mysterious and magical, or when I've straight invented the material myself, I've obviously had plenty of room for fairy tale goblins, or perhaps "hiisi", the Finnish equivalent. It's just that when you use a ready-made adventure scenario, goblins are much more commonly used as tribal humanoids than the lowest rung of the fae order, so that's necessitated figuring out how I want to do that. For me it just has happened to be the case that I've found it very useful to swap tribal humans in there instead of keeping Gygaxian humanoids around. Mike seems to find it useful to do the opposite - fine by me, it's his lookout.<br/><br/>As others, I find the political and literary themes of D&amp;D quite interesting (which is not contradictory with the creative agenda of challengeful gaming, in case you were wondering), which plays a major part in my choice to essentially remove the classical goblins and other humanoid monsters, and replace them with either more magical beings ("orcs" my campaign interpreted as soulless underworld demon-beings that were let into the world through "orc rifts" created by necromancers or such) or humans. I just didn't want to deal with the setting flavour of extreme racism (or perhaps "racialism" would be clearer in an English context) that results from positing whole non-human civilizations that sit on top of all the gold that adventurers want to own.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough Jim Raggi ended up with the same exact solution around the same time-frame last decade that I did. (You can read about what he does with goblins in the GM book of LotFP - basically recommends doing the same thing I do when you encounter goblins and such in adventure modules.) In general it is a little bit amusing how it's not entirely misplaced to talk about a "Finnish" approach to D&amp;D styling, thanks to certain broad creative harmony in mine an Jim's recent play. We've both influenced a few other people in direct lineage (and more by writing about our playstyle), which means that although we started independently, at this point there's a bunch of people here who've been influenced by similar ideas. Of course not everybody is running historical fantasy, and it's not like I'm planning to stick with these particular aesthetic choices for ever and ever, but right now the effect is strange. Just yesterday after the game one of my friends here remarked about how strangely this historical fantasy thing seems to have taken over in his local circles over the last couple of years, as if everybody's doing it instead of what we seemed to be doing 10 years back <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>For an example of a prominent OSR author who's working the opposite approach, consider Zak Smith's Vornheim setting. He's got these amazingly colorful heavy metal folklore underground magic goblins. They've got like entire cities of goblins where the ruling elite walks on the ceilings, and stuff like that - very fae beings, which fit well in the setting as whole, the way it rocks surreal fantasy.

This is how our campaign ended up intepreting the critters, one at a time as they came up during actual play:<br/><b>Goblins</b> - human "hill-people", reclusive known hunter-gatherer peoples living in the wild spaces where civilization had not enroached yet. Sort of likes Lapps in Finnish history, or Finns for Scandinavians and Russians. Where they have subhuman HD (remember the sources often differ slightly), that's because of malnutrition and general hardship in life.<br/><b>Hobgoblins</b> - warrior elites of the goblin tribes. When encountered alone without goblins at hand, often a warrior cult consisting of the best from multiple goblin tribes, engaging in short or long term pilgrimage, training camp, guarding holy goblin site, etc.<br/><b>Orcs</b> - non-human, soulless demon-warriors made of non-earthly matter. No language, but swarm instinct and integral capabilities in the ways of war. There is a <i>Control Orcs</i> 2nd level M-U spell, of course, known to demonologists. When orcs are treated anything like a tribal civilization in an adventure module, I just swap them 1:1 with goblins and hobgoblins.<br/><b>Ogres</b> - a religio-social malady/curse affecting the "whitey" civilization (that's not me being cute about American racial slang so much as me being cute about translating an old Finnish racial epithet used to distinguish between the Christian, agricultural majority population and peoples such as gypsies and Lapps); on occasion people living reclusively away from regular church-going folks get these cannibalistic urges (several possible reasons, but essentially it's just the way of the world) that, when you give in, turn the person over time into a predatorial, hulking mass of hungry flesh. Some (perhaps depending on their human inclinations or whatever) turn into "ogre mages", cunning beings capable of disguising their ogre nature and walking among humans to prey on them. Ogres tend to be solitary, but on occasion they form communities controlled by an ogre mage, joined together by their inhuman appetites.<br/><b>Bugbears</b> - (this was the "furry giant goblinoid", I think) a sort of a goblin ethic/cultural counterpart of the ogre; the animist goblin tribes do not seem to suffer from ogricism, but they have a similar encepalopathy particularly associated with tribal shamanism that causes gigantism, excessive fur growth and irrational behaviour patterns to some few tribesmen. Bugbears are generally driven out of their tribes, and the phenomenon is considered a sad plight against which goblin mothers sacrifice to venerated spirits, although occasionally they are exploited by unscrupulous goblin shamans and such.<br/><b>Ghouls</b> - considering the intimate relationship of ogres and human cannibalism, one is forced to ask whether ghouls have something to do with it as well. Interestingly enough the answer seems to be negative, despite "ghoul" in my historical fantasy campaign having been sort of a disease-like affliction as well; they're just two separate phenomena that have something to do with cannibalism, it seems. The ghoul in our campaign was a sort of a biological/memetic disease (one of the absolutely weirdest adventures we had concerned a company of 400 foot soldiers being quarantined on an island near Venice while a rash of ghoulism raged among their ranks and the PC command cadre attempted to cleanse the company) that would not let go in far-progressed cases even in death, so that a ghoul colony would generally include about 50% "technically living" ghouls and 50% "proper undead" ghouls. I know, it's weird to have two unrelated cannibalism myths going here, but that's how it came out when the historical fantasy aesthetic was smashed together with a random series of adventure modules featuring both critters.<br/><b>Kobolds</b> - mythical earth fae, encountered in deep mines and such. This was a given, considering how the campaign tramped over German landscapes. Rare, magical creatures, essentially same as Finnish (or English) gnomes. Where an adventure would require otherwise (a rare situation - the OSR adventure stock I've mostly used has kobolds pretty rare, for some reason), I just put in particularly malnourished, almost comically wretched goblins instead.<br/><b>Lizard-men</b> - as an interesting exception to the tendency of getting rid of the humanoid monsters on aesthetic grounds, I actually actively preserved the lizardpeople, and even used them myself in original scenarios a little bit <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> The idea was that lizardmen are an extremely reclusive, degenerate, exclusively underground species descended from the mythical, nefarious snakepeoples of antediluvian Earth. Pulp fantasy inspiration here, basically - by having them be an unknown horrible secret of the inner earth I'd avoid having them like steal sheep from local farmers. The shock factor is nice for players who are used to dealing with goblin tribes that you can sort of deal with - unlike my primitive tribesmen goblins, you can't live among the lizardmen and sing their songs, not without utmost degeneracy of your own humanity. Where lizard-men are used on the surface by an adventure, I substitute a degenerate human snake cult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430472/#Comment_430472" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-03T07:20:19+00:00" title="April  3, 2014  7:20AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to think that as I use more adventure modules and TSR stuff generally then my view and interpretation of the monsterous in D&amp;D will become more nuanced. That's not necessarily to make Goblins into a "race" of aboriginal humans as opposed to an adversarial species of supernatural origin though. I'm interested, Eero, in why your playgroup has given this treatment to Goblins (to make them essentially capital-p People, right?) but hasn't awarded the same position to Orcs or Lizardmen (who of all the adversarial beings in your campaign most sound like they should be given an equal status to humanity, being it's genetically estranged mirror-image after all). Why are Orcs demonic summonses that can be controlled like chess pieces by lv.2 Magic Users whereas Goblins are the noble savage? I appreciate a lot of it comes down to the aesthetic (or even moral?) tastes of the group and the justifications of the positioning that come through play, but it strikes me as slightly discordant - could you walk me through the thinking here? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430477/#Comment_430477" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-03T10:01:17+00:00" title="April  3, 2014 10:01AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think maybe my use of "gygaxian naturalism" is too AD&amp;D for this conversation, yeah. I am talking about that fundamentalist interpretation of the text, which is very powerful for setting up a game and expectations.<br/><br/>But here is another go at describing the difference: I considered it very important to write some of my own materials, especially a little booklet for character creation, because I want that rock-solid reasoning that comes from saying "this is how goblins behave in the rulebook" that you use, mike, but with only some of the ideas there. Although I walk new players through character creation orally almost always, the text I give them still offers a lot of hints about this stuff if they ever actually bother reading it: that elves are probably changeling children in human places rather than what they have learned from video games, that if halflings reach their level limit and you don't retire them they are basically going to turn into monsters or faeries or leprechauns or something.<br/><br/>I don't play modules, very intentionally, although I'm interested in doing more to reference or interrogate them. But I do find it very interesting that Raggis game, which seems to follow a lot of that same motivation, falls back on that support, which as you say Eero, makes most sense as a way of interpreting past texts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430482/#Comment_430482" name="Item_209" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-03T11:31:03+00:00" title="April  3, 2014 11:31AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those specific interpretations I have there are entirely organic in nature: the adventures we played, in the specific order we played them, ended up with those interpretations being the ones that worked for me as the GM.<br/><br/>Specifically, orcs ended up the way they did in part because the only orcs that came up for like 60 sessions were some individual ones dropped nigh-randomly into an adventure with a necromancer.

I could easily see that if we had played something else instead of "Tomb of the Iron God", "Tower of the Stargazer", "Three Brides" and "Temple of the Ghoul" as the first adventures of the campaign, then surely those monster interpretations would also have evolved differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430484/#Comment_430484" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-03T11:45:21+00:00" title="April  3, 2014 11:45AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, did you ever encounter a situation in some adventure that caused a notable dissonance or raised difficult to integrate issues?

(I don't have anything in mind that would even qualify, but it seems like if there was something like that, it would be instructive.)</blockquote>\nI wouldn't say that this would have come up as a problem. It is easy for the GM (seems easy to me, I mean) to spin things creatively, or make the necessary changes in an adventure to make it all make sense. Note that "make sense" is not here the dry prune legalism concept that players occasionally use to argue their cases - there is no need or requirement for things to go the way a player with no imagination expects them to be, and a mere player claim that things have to be the way he wants them to be or they "won't make sense" is not true without further substance. The fiction can take a surprising amount of variation and surprise before you even need to consider changing anything.<br/><br/>For example, it would be a small mind that would claim that all goblins all over the campaign world have to worship that same goblin god, wear the same goblin dresses and speak the same goblin language that the first tribe we encountered did. That has not been true of a single tribal culture in the real world, as far as we know. The word "goblin" is just a word, if it becomes important we can discard even the subtle suggestion that all of the goblin tribes that show up in play are ethnically related to each other - maybe slightly different parts of the campaign world have entirely different stocks of primitive forest people that have nothing to do with each other. Note that the term "goblin" may or may not be swung around in actual play - in our historical campaign any and all terminology is local and ethnographic anyway, the PCs don't have like a pokedex where they check out the official name of something they encounter. "Goblin" is usually a local whitey ethnic term/slur (little difference in a pre-liberal world), often mired in weird superstitions (so the local human NPCs really believe that goblins spoil milk and kidnap babies, it just so happens that these "goblins" are actually real people who live in the wilds).<br/><br/>Regarding practical themes, for us the colonialistic theme with D&amp;D adventurers and goblins has worked quite naturally: the players are quick enough on their feet that even somebody who doesn't know about goblins being a "primitive hunter-gathered ethnicity of humans" generally speaking has their footing back after five minutes of actual play. (I don't think I've ever met anybody outside the Internet who would just plain choke on the idea that they have to deal with human NPCs in a dungeon crawl.) After that point it's just a matter of depicting encounters between civilizations with massive discrepancy in material culture and significant differences in spiritualism - not to speak of language issues and such. Many players go all Pocahontas on the situation, some play hardline conquistadors (that is, standard D&amp;D adventurers - there is no practical difference), some basically empathetic yet practical opportunists who'll sell some wildmen down the river if there's real reward for them in it. It's all quite reasonable as a social roleplaying challenge, where sometimes the adventurers end up like trading with and learning from the local goblins, and sometimes they end up in bitter genocidal wars with them (gratifyingly often to their own detriment, although not always). Easy enough for even a single hardliner to blow up any peace conferences or such, after all, and the goblins generally aren't stupid enough to let you betray them twice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430509/#Comment_430509" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T00:00:57+00:00" title="April  4, 2014 12:00AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I can see how you've reskinned a lot of D&amp;D tropes regarding monsters and races (which, in my mind, made sense in the context of Tolkien's own mythology, but took on a whole different sense when mixed up in the D&amp;D-verse), in part by circumstance (I can see how the campaign ideas develop organically, depending on which adventures are being pursued) and in part by following your own aesthetic principles and demands. <br/><br/>Did you go through a similar process when dealing with the assumptions of D&amp;D adventure? After all, the vast majority of D&amp;D adventures include a number of supernatural events, items, or locations, some extreme danger (in the form of monsters and traps), and a very significant quantity of treasure, wealth, and goods. <br/><br/>You've already explained that seeing the supernatural elements in these D&amp;D tropes doesn't bother you, essentially by saying that these are local phenomena, and we won't deal with how they impact the world until the PCs have encountered them. (And then, as you say, if the resulting events bring the existence of snakemen or elves to the awareness of the Pope, something in the setting may change!)<br/><br/>But what about the incredible danger/threat present in typical D&amp;D adventures (e.g. a group of wandering monsters, ambitious necromancers, pits which bring forth endless cannibalistic monstrosities, massive deathtraps, etc)? Do you spare any effort to make it believable that there might be three such sources of danger within a few miles of a small village, and no one has relocated or fled? <br/><br/>Similarly, what about the vast treasures which tend to appear in D&amp;D adventures? Do you justify them somehow, or does it just so happen that every little indigenous tribe happens to hoard riches beyond the pale? If there are treasures in a nearby cave, why haven't they been plundered?<br/><br/>Do you spend any time on these concerns as the campaign develops, or is it hand-waved away, since it is, after all, almost necessary for play? (I'm thinking in particular of a situation where an adventure module might be attempted by a group of characters, and then abandoned - perhaps due to a TPK. Now this thing has been established as entering existence nearby some rather normal European settlement... what happens next? Does it just fade away into obscurity until the next PC encounters it, or does it have an impact on the outside world?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430510/#Comment_430510" name="Item_216" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T01:16:07+00:00" title="April  4, 2014  1:16AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do agree that it's surprising from an external viewpoint that the credibility of the setting can withstand having a necromancer's lair near an ordinary European town. I would not have expected this to work myself, had I been presented with the aesthetic notion in advance of trying it out. However, it is apparently the case that normality can stand quite a bit of stress and still contribute entirely meaningfully to the game's setting and strategic landscape.<br/><br/>We do certainly pay attention to the things you mention, but it is apparently not the case that these concerns would become showstoppers. A healthy amount of constructive priority (meaning, we assume the facts on the ground and then deduce their reasons, instead of assuming our own baseless assumptions from some medieval movie and then deducing why the facts on the ground can't be true, like a destructive player thinks) helps, as does a varied knowledge base and a general maturity in understanding the natural and social sciences - it simply is not the case that we would get stuck in idiotic arguments about like whether katanas were known in Europe in the 16th century, if you're imagining the setting discovery process to be like that. The world is a complex place and <i>everything</i> has justifiable exceptions as long as you're willing to keep an open mind.<br/><br/>Some specific notes:<br/><br/>The "vast treasures" in D&amp;D adventures are not actually so vast for the most part. A big part of that impression is that people often don't have a very good grasp on economy, and a part is that they're treating these treasures at a personal scale - so it's sort of a myth that D&amp;D dungeon treasures are unrealistically insane in scope. (Many of those treasures are exceptional and unrealistic in <i>social</i> terms, yes - but that doesn't matter as long as your hoard is owned by like elves or something; who's to say that those don't just sit on top of big gold piles because they smell nice?) Ultimately, after a couple hundred sessions of "historical fantasy D&amp;D", I have to say that PCs have never been even a blip on the radars of true merchant princes and other money men of the late medieval. An ordinary high nobleman (hochadel, I mean) brings in like 50 000 accounting units a year as profits from their estates (on top of political influence and such, and of course this is a number that varies massively case to case), while adventurers find "huge" treasure hoards in the thousands of units. Springs them from rural poor to urban middle class, sure, but getting further is behind some real serious work and luck. We've played ordinary published adventures (mostly OSR, mostly low-level), and we've never seen a dungeon that would have come even close to triggering a genuine gold rush or cause any such large scale economic disruption. Dungeon adventure operations are simply too small in scale and too quick in time-span to cause economic realignment, except in the personal finances of the adventurers.<br/><br/>(Remember that I have stripped the game of all artificial level-ups, and generally 90% of adventures seeded in the setting are "low level", so the campaign's power-level profile is different from what you might be used to; from my reading it seems that many, even most groups that play D&amp;D use various cheats to get to "mid-levels" quickly, and then stay there for the rest of the campaign. The TSR level 4-8 monty haul adventures you're thinking of are very, very rare, and treated as epic exceptions instead of any kind of routine. Practically no hoard has more than 10 000 units of treasure in one place in this sort of low-level sandbox; we had exactly two exceptions in 100 sessions, I think, and one of those was clearly broken design while the other wasn't a "hoard", but rather the on-hand warchest of the Northern League of Italian merchant city-states condottieri army.)<br/><br/>As for magical monstrosities and such, remember that the medieval rural landscape is full of such superstitions <i>anyway</i>. When the player characters unearthed Jason Morningstar's viking tomb full of undead crewsmen, and then abandoned the place for a couple months, that became a wild folklore story for the local villages; the undead vikings renovated their burial boat, brought it to the river and sailed it out to seas unknown. Admittedly that specific example could have turned into a paradigm shift if the undead vikings had, I don't know, proved contagious or something. Didn't happen at that time, although later we did indeed get that massive paradigm shift when the PCs had that zombie incident in Italy. Most such events, though, may have local witnesses and then they just become wild stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430511/#Comment_430511" name="Item_217" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T01:16:15+00:00" title="April  4, 2014  1:16AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Point is, the historical landscape does not get shaken by a few elves in the woods or revenants rising from their graves - that's what people entertained at least half-seriously in their worldview <i>anyway</i> in historical Europe. A necromancer? Say rather, a witch or demon-worshipper, unless you're particularly latinate. Sure, of course over a long term we would see serious skew from our reality in a world where this superstitious folklore actually has a basis in fact, but let's just take that as a genre conceit of historical fantasy, shall we? We'll just pretend that somehow the world has gotten so far with the supernatural being somewhat obscure - well known as the religions and superstitions of the people attest, but fundamentally exotic and unknown to the people anyway. Perhaps it is in the divine plan for the fantastic to wilt and pass away beyond the dominion of Christ? It's the same setting <i>Ars Magica</i> uses, so perhaps reading those books might give a more detailed view of what's what.<br/><br/>It should be noted that my wilderness random encounter processes are much, much less drastic than the standard D&amp;D practices indicate. Gygax wants a savage wilderness where non-leveled human population lifespans are measured in diurnal cycles as horrible monsters (much worse than any real predatory animal) attack every day. I do not, obviously, see the point in that (this is of course because we prioritize different things: Gygax wanted short-term logistical friction for mid-level parties moving through wilderness while low-level parties wouldn't dare to do it, while I seem to have much more concern for setting realism), so it is simply not the case that fantastic monsters would lurk in every nook and cranny; the vast majority of the setting is essentially historical, and when something fantastic is encountered in the wilds it's like an adventure hook: there is some reason for this thing, ankhegs or owlbears don't just <i>happen</i> in this setting with no explanation to them.<br/><br/>There is a constant low-level fabulation happening when you play the game like this. For example, it is the case in this setting that the dominant branch of "arcane" magic in medieval Europe has been inherited from religio-cosmological ideas of neo-Platonic philosophy of late antiquity; wizards are essentially "natural" philosophers following a different (strictly speaking heretical) cosmology. This interesting little detail comes up on occasion, and it is used to colour in the details of what magic looks like, but there's no big setting sourcebook that the most anal-retentive players would study obsessively so they could then apply this by itself huge setting fact to rip apart setting consistency. (Speaking as the GM, I totally would give a fucking hardcore resistance to any Sunday historian who wanted to puncture holes in my fantasy history, but ultimately they would obviously succeed - I could not logically defend the consistency of the conceit that neo-Platonism has magical powers and accidentally happens to die out <i>anyway</i> without significant impact on Christian cosmology against an intentional, concerted assault forever.)<br/><br/>I would say that the ideas of hidden treasures, horrifying monsters and magical mysteries secreted within obscure cults and uncovered by the occasional holy men in their hermitages aren't really all that difficult to work with. This might sound funny, but ultimately the specific conceits of Gygaxian dungeon construction can be much more bothersome: why are these monks building pit traps in their cellars? Whoever has the time to dig these long and labyrinthine dungeon corridors? How come all these dungeon giant insects are always poisonous? How does this massive stonework arch stay intact without support pillars? I rely on explanations such as gothic insanity (many of the builders of places that later on become adventure location ruins weren't right in the head in the first place), goblinoid cultural pathologies (their religion encourages digging pit traps, say), dungeon giganticism (the pseudo-scientific observation that these pesky little critters sure seem to grow fucking huge whenever they get to live underground for a few generations) and above all seeping dungeon otherworld in the Philotomy vein: when you get deep enough underground, your petty European assumptions about the nature of the world get thrown out of the window: maybe there <i>is</i> a vast Agharta down there somewhere, a vast sinuous empire of degenerate lizard-people and all manner of Gygaxian lunacy viewed through the feverish nightmare eyeglasses of a human explorer of these alien reaches. We are non-committal on that until we know exactly how far down the rabbit hole leads.<br/><br/><i>Of course</i> much of this creative process is necessarily ironical in nature - we know perfectly well that we are making a Gygax/history mashup instead of starting from pure historical precepts (like Ars Magica does - the only difference between our setting and Ars is that the latter lacks the D&amp;D fantasy elements) and sticking to them. If we wanted to do the latter, we would not use a wide variety of published adventure modules, now would we? Because of the specific manner in which the campaign has grown, it is a necessity to have a bit of good humour and an ability to accept that some things in the setting are just pretty weird, thanks to the D&amp;D fantasy well we are sampling from. I don't mind this personally, as the combination has proven vivacious, exciting, surprisingly realistic in historical fantasy terms, and much more colorful and phantasmagoric than we'd get if we decided to play more restrained on the historical front. Things like say dobbelgangers are fucking terrifying in a setting like this, with deep cultural implications, rather than just being dungeon ecology curiousities like in Greyhawk.<br/><br/>In fact, an observation: you don't need to have that perfect nerdy faith in the perfectness of your setting that e.g. <i>Harn</i> or <i>Glorantha</i> fans seem to evince at times. For challengeful adventure gaming you merely need the setting to be consistent enough for a robust local shared imagined space to occur and be applied in strategic problem-solving. That's a localized process, has nothing to do with large scale setting concerns. So anybody who reads my preference and excitement for a more historical D&amp;D setting as some dusty desire for perfect realistic fidelity should revise their ideas - there's a long, long distance on the spectrum of gamer geek pathologies from where this campaign sits to actual historical nerdery <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430512/#Comment_430512" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T02:38:39+00:00" title="April  4, 2014  2:38AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>maybe there is a vast Agharta down there somewhere, a vast sinuous empire of degenerate lizard-people and all manner of Gygaxian lunacy viewed through the feverish nightmare eyeglasses of a human explorer of these alien reaches.</blockquote>\nIt is not for the first time I wished I could speak Finnish. I want <i>in</i>! <br/><br/>It's gratifying to read your thoughts expanded: It's interesting to see how the your process of justification is similar to mine in method but takes a few different turns. I suppose it's all down to taste and a little prior inclination. <br/>One considerable difference in my conception of the D&amp;D world compared to yours is in regards to Wilderness encounters - I was working on the assumption that this table wasn't intended to model the real passage of everyday people over a wilderness, but is the sole reserve of the adventurous party breaking new ground and discovering things unseen by human eyes: the wilderness is a Hex dungeon in a sense. To phrase it differently, the common highway and ploughed fields don't cause travellers to roll vs. wilderness: such civilised places obviously don't house supernatural monsters with any frequency, otherwise they wouldn't be civilised. <br/><br/>I'd like to defend the merits of monsters as humanity's antagonists and the colonial mindset in D&amp;D at some point, but I feel it's a tricky one and involving a bunch of motivations and potential pitfalls.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430514/#Comment_430514" name="Item_219" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T04:38:46+00:00" title="April  4, 2014  4:38AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The D&amp;D attitude of "let's have the antagonists be monster-men so we don't feel bad about killing them all" seems like it has pretty transparent motivations. If anything, in this hedonistic age one may well ask why somebody would feel the need to mess up their wish-fulfillment fantasy with inconvenient criticism. For me personally it's largely because I'm more interested in real challenges, and fighting a war of underground xenocide against "goblinoids" is a pretty pale and bloodless scenario insofar as wargames go - troop morale, war goals, fifth cohort action, social hacking, strategic alliances and a multitude of other wargaming elements are twisted unrecognizable by the Gygaxian "humans vs. monsters" scenario. It's artistically more interesting to play in a sandbox less distanced from the real world, one where such basic questions as "do we even need to wage war here at all" are initially up in the air.<br/><br/>Also, I have to admit that I'm not very good at framing my pastimes in hedonistic terms; the idea that I would simply color-code the bad guys for harmless convenience in slaughter sits ill with me, I guess because I presume that I'm trying to do something better than just slake my hidden fantasies of racist violence in a socially acceptable manner. I would start questioning the entire thing if I myself thought that the point of the game is to have things be easy and fun, and that "wish-fulfillment" for us means slaughter and rapine without consequence or moral depth. How would that be different from being entertained by murder porn?<br/><br/>(To clarify my mind-set, what first comes to mind to me as "inconsequential wish-fulfillment" would be something like I don't know, <i>My Little Pony</i>. It just doesn't strike me personally as entertaining to play D&amp;D with the attitude that a goblin needs to be monstrous so that we would have more fun killing it.)<br/><br/>Questions all, of course, and I definitely will not be the one to launch this spring's moralistic shit-storm by starting to sling judgements about other people's fun. The above's just trying to explore why the great convenience of the Gygaxian fantasy world sits a little bit ill with me aesthetically. One part distaste for how it simplifies the strategic picture, one part distaste for the videogamey convenience of the entire scheme of for-profit monster-killing.<br/><br/>As I indicated earlier, I could see myself running <i>Greyhawk</i> as well - the original Gygaxian fantasy setting. I would probably make a point of not romanticizing or ignoring the nature of the setting, though; it is a savage horror of social Darwinism, with little hope for the world unless the Good peoples succeed in wholesale xenocide, extinguishing the Evil broods from the face of Oerth. It is a setting in which the worst fantasies of white power ideology are explored, as strategic rape taints humanity with orcish blood and entire races of human-like beings are pawns of a dualistic struggle between the light and the darkness for no other reason than their heritage of blood. A majestic, feverish fantasy world where it is fully justified to raise your blade for the greater glory of Good <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(That is of course just what strikes me as interesting and unique in the Gygaxian fantasy world. Please forgive me a certain degree of rhetorical emphasis in characterizing the Greyhawk setting - I don't mean to indicate that the setting would have been originally imagined <i>for</i> the racialist themes, it just happens to be what you get when you want to have the bad guys conveniently color-coded for easy killing. It is the case, though, that this exactly is my point: if you're not going to depict evil humanoids in that light, then what's the point of having them in the first place? Little enough, and that's why my less racial holy war setting doesn't feature them, striving instead for the historical ambivalence of our own world - ethnicities exist and they matter, but they're not split into convenient cosmological camps by natural law itself.)<br/><br/>Also, in case somebody's reading along and wondering how come I see any difference between killing goblins for their loots and killing indians for their loots, the difference is in that first objection, basically: once our strategic question is no longer "how do we kill these monster-people", but rather "how do I grasp at fortune in this cruel world", the game doesn't feel queasy for me any more, despite occasionally swerving towards grim topics. Sure, on occasion the free-booter adventurers will choose to accomplish their quest for fortune by wholesale xenocide of a convenient out-group, but at least it's no longer obviously color-coded into the bones of the game; rather, the rapine becomes a sort of a simulation of the colonial challenges and issues, a little window into what makes a conquistador tick. A small aesthetic difference, but I feel that where Gygax largely <i>celebrates</i> conquistadorialism (intentionally or not), our play <i>explores</i> it. Over a longer time-frame the difference is seen concretely, as PCs find constructive ways to relate to the savage peoples that come their way in their looting, and we start seeing more and more things such as goblin PCs. It is actually rather exciting to realize that in a world where "goblin" does not automatically mean "meat to be wasted" there is some slim room for play that attempts to align all human peoples together against the unknown. After all, why couldn't you join forces with the goblins you find squatting on the 1st level of the dungeon, and dig up the forgotten big treasures of the ancients from their cursed tombs with their aid? No structural reason in the game at all why not, once you drop the specific Greyhawk (or D&amp;D, these being interchangeable) cosmology with its Evil-by-birth thinking.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430524/#Comment_430524" name="Item_220" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T06:42:25+00:00" title="April  4, 2014  6:42AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2014 7:34AM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm dead-set on challenging the idea that my interests in monster antagonism is hedonistic or serving any purpose other that to make entertaining play. I'm really baffled by the idea that I'm engaging in murder porn of zero creative worth simply because I'm engaging with a game whose main interests revolve around battling in-human beings and taking their (?) property. Confusing Goblins with the figure of colonial Native strikes me as problematizing where the intent of the text is a much more innocent in this regard and is clear that the central conceit of the fantasy setting is that the white European native is no longer steward of the Earth and must face well-equipped and often hostile co-inhabitors of the landscape - Dwarves, Halflings, Elves, Goblins, Fairies, Ogres, etc. This is demonstrable in the "post-apocalyptic" or medieval-millenniumist mood: the D&amp;D setting often assumes a once-great civilisation that has since fallen leaving only ruins and secrets (the historical reality being the High Days of Rome moving into the "Dark" Ages) that the PCs now explore. I see this as a historical period where the European human hubris has led to a new dark age and communities coming under threat by "barbarian" forces (monsters, magic  - orcs and goblins typically) is a new and terrifying prospect. What I'm saying is that I'd circumvent the colonialist interpretation by not choosing to interpret the conflict between men and monsters as one of colonial contact and control by the white man but a model of equal rivials engaged in protracted feudal competition to a shared homeland. The idea of the Shire, Rivendell and Gondor as separate but equal communities drawn along "racial" lines (by species? The language is confusing here) that might be allies or enemies against one another is a good example of this. Obviously these conflicts aren't without consequence (any notion of having a continuous setting implies actions have consequences) but they simply aren't drawn up in a colonialist debate. In effect, the Goblins I meet in the dungeon aren't the native inhabitants who have a moral right to defend their home - they're combatants from an enemy nation participating with consent in a territorial dispute over this dungeon corridor. Of course even modern warfare is varied in tone and exchange, so the conversation could well be civilised and negotiations made if the monsters aren't in the mood for combat - but it's called diplomacy or parley for a reason. Usually I conduct my PCs in-line with the Geneva Convention (the good treatment of prisoners, avoiding cruel or inhuman weapons) and I feel some moral requirement has been met, like playing the Allies in a WW2 setting. Conflict and murder are essentially immoral but I feel I can stomach it if I'm playing at consenting soldier-mercenary (not conquistador) and the point of play is negotiating fictional conflicts. Genocide is a loaded word and I am loath to use it when talking about D&amp;D. <br/><br/>I do, however, love the motivation behind play being "how do I grasp fortune in this cruel world?" Even in my war-game conception of early D&amp;D that strikes me as a good way to direct the game to a potentially less problematic place. Good work! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Though the real moral debate isn't one surrounding colonialism but one about mercenary activity and proto-capitalist/feudalist greed.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430525/#Comment_430525" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T07:01:36+00:00" title="April  4, 2014  7:01AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've liked the approach of treating goblins and such in modules as aboriginal tribes since I discovered it via Eero. I am thinking of using it in my new campaign.<br/><br/>One concern I've had is how to introduce it to players who may have more Gygaxian expectations of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>On the one hand I don't want to have villagers worried about "goblins" in the hills, and the PCs then go and slaughter them without realizing that goblins in this context means something different than they are used to. Only later on they realize, "my god... we're monsters!". Well, no - the GM just set you up for guilt.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I'm not sure I want to have this whole OOC setup thing where I say, "Look this is how this world is," because it destroys some of the way in which the characters would think about the goblins coming from the cultural background of the main civilization. I kind of want to have the PCs having some racial bias that we can then explore.<br/><br/>Basically, if we were starting from somewhere other than D&amp;D, I'd just say, "The villagers tell of you of the nasty gremlin folk who live in the woods and swap their children for changelings" and I'd expect the players to not necessarily trust this info and go in at least expecting the possibility of more nuance.<br/><br/>Whereas with the starting point of D&amp;D, I'm worried the players will just assume that of course the expectation is genocide, and won't bother to explore their other choices as they'll assume that would be counter to the system's expectations.<br/><br/>How did you handle this Eero?

I couldn't possibly tell, I'm just musing up there based on prior discussions about these sorts of topics. It's something of a trend for the D&amp;D setup to be justified by it merely being a game, and by the fact that the players want to kill things for loots, so you got to provide.<br/><br/>Your specific take on avoiding the colonialist overtones is interesting as well. In many adventures it is somewhat possible to interpret it like the humanoid monsters are not defending their homes in the dungeon, that is true. I would still say that the majority situation is one where that interpretation is not really credible: goblins clearly don't have a complex civilization where they'd project force over great distances, and they often seem set up to stay, with hearths and families. Other humanoids (like hobgoblins, often represented as organized and civilized beings, sort of fantasy nazis) are more credible as organized polities competing for dungeon resources in a cold war situation, of course.<br/><br/>I guess that in a setting like that monstrous humanoids don't necessarily need to be dealt with as victims. If you don't have the "inherently evil" aspect, then it's not like Greyhawk, either. Given those two points (monstrous humanoids are non-victimized, and are not inherently evil), then you do indeed have sort of a Great Game situation, with brave PC officers of his majesty's navy facing down the dastardly frogs over natural resources under contention. Of course that Greyhawk question does persist: why have them be non-human if you're just going to deal with them like human ethnicities. I suppose there are subtle aesthetic reasons, similar to why Star Trek has so many forehead alien types when they could just have an "ancient human diaspora".<br/><br/>Regarding the intent of the D&amp;D text itself, though, I think it's pretty clear that there is a stark dividing line between good races and evil ones in by the book D&amp;D. You can live with elves and dwarves, and their mutual distrust is a great tragedy, while the best you can hope for with a goblin is a cease-fire while they plot how to stab you in the back. Surely this is not controversial, as regards the actual D&amp;D mainstream.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430528/#Comment_430528" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T07:19:38+00:00" title="April  4, 2014  7:19AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How did you handle this Eero?

There simply isn't any book you can look in to cross-correlate it when a NPC uses the word "goblin". You have to ask the GM whether your character's supposed to know something about these goblins, or ask the NPCs, and that's just an ordinary process of discovery - if you end up killing everything and later regretting it, perhaps you should've done your groundwork a bit better. It's no different from my viewpoint than the PCs killing a "witch" before they found out that they're really a good witch.<br/><br/>When I have players with a firm grounding in D&amp;D I tend to open the first session with any such by simply telling them that this isn't your grand-daddy's D&amp;D, and that it's no good to assume that anything works they way you're used to. This isn't generally a problem, as people for whom officialness is important have generally self-selected out of the player pool long before they end up at the table. "Contains excessive house ruling" is the normal warning label that you put on a campaign like this, seems to have been the standard when D&amp;D was still being played in houseruled manner <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430537/#Comment_430537" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T11:49:00+00:00" title="April  4, 2014 11:49AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2014 11:51AM by adamwb.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely do not recognize my game in your description of monsters-qua-monsters play, Eero.<br/><br/>D&amp;D creates a model of the medieval in which problems are solved by combat. Insults are solved with to-the-death combat, because that is what they do in heroic romances and the sagas and the fiction that is based on those things. You make deals with people and if they don't work you fight them. Sometimes this is in a tunnel in the ground and sometimes it is a ritual duel above the ground.<br/><br/>This is not because of war, it is because that is how society works. You get to be a lord by getting enough treasure to be 9th level. It's a mistake to try to live in this fictional medieval by liberal ethics.<br/><br/>I don't think my players could be described as making war on goblins any more than they make war on men, although they have certainly fought many of each.<br/><br/>Yes of course post-greyhawk published worlds have a certain dynamic. But we are not beholden to Gygax's politics, which in my mind at least lines up pretty well with your description of a social-darwinist world, Eero. He was an American exceptionalist who ultimately demonstrated that he was actually a shitty businessman despite viewing collaborators as instrumental and discarding them to preserve his own power, and his play culture was also informed tremendously by American military culture.<br/><br/>Why not just throw out the bits you don't like directly?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>To me, changing the nature of goblins doesn't solve Gygax's racism. What is described as "interesting" play involving colonial guilt etc. sounds overplayed to me, and perhaps just an attempt to feel smugly superior to the module authors without actually changing the problematic parts of their play-style. In the mean time, it also blocks the things that I am much more attracted to, and that I think D&amp;D is well suited to: addressing the landscape as composed of beings which can be bargained with, tricked, or fought, but don't obey the rules of humanity because they are fundamentally different in nature.<br/><br/>I get so sad when, outside of this game talk, I read people speculating that folkloric beings are based on, say, extinct Neanderthal people or early European tribes or something like that, this incredible yet profoundly unimaginative stretch that ignores the easily observable way that we like to assign personality to the forces of the world around us, and refuses to consider that people have lived with different ethics than we have now. We have been using an animist landscape to structure our lives and actually solve problems for much longer than we've had post-tolkein, post WWII, orcs on our minds.<br/><br/>Part of what led me back to this game was reading a lot of theory and games criticism coming out of speculative realist philosophy / object-oriented ontology, that recognized games in general, but especially those coming out of D&amp;D's tradition as being powerful in this way, and it connected pretty well with things I was thinking about real people's worldviews, especially some thinking about constructing Neopaganisms that I have a lot of exposure to. It's what I play the game for. Monsters cannot be human for me to address these ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430539/#Comment_430539" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-04T12:18:47+00:00" title="April  4, 2014 12:18PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great discussion. I'm really enjoying reading all the (slightly) different takes on this topic, and find myself nodding along with all of you: there are different subtle ways to look at issues of race and violence, and I think there's room for variation here. \n<blockquote>[...] addressing the landscape as composed of beings which can be bargained with, tricked, or fought, but don't obey the rules of humanity because they are fundamentally different in nature.<br/></blockquote>\nThis resonates with me, and I see that feature in Eero's playstyle, as well. (Kind of makes me wish we could encounter some "goblins" in the IRC game, just to see how Eero presents them in "real time"!)\n<blockquote>I'd just say, "The villagers tell of you of the nasty gremlin folk who live in the woods and swap their children for changelings" and I'd expect the players to not necessarily trust this info and go in at least expecting the possibility of more nuance.</blockquote>\nThis would be sufficient for me as a player (along with a frank discussion that this isn't some kind of generic vanilla "by the book" D&amp;D). More than sufficient: it tells me everything I need to know and, combined with intelligent GM-description when actually encountering said goblins, leads me naturally to play where I'm questioning what I'm seeing and reacting to it without assumptions. (I've found that minor aesthetic changes are enough here; for instance, if the "goblins" in your game are presented as having light orange fur covering their lower body, that's enough to let me know that these aren't "generic D&amp;D goblins" but rather unique creatures I need to assess and deal with without a priori assumptions.)<br/><br/>I can't speak for everyone, of course, but to me that's plenty clear.<br/><br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>Your approach to handling the weirdness of D&amp;D-tropes for adventure in a semi-realistic setting makes sense now; there's a certain level of ironic enjoyment, I think, in throwing together the "real" and the bizarre D&amp;D-stuff and seeing what comes out, and that's quite appealing.<br/><br/>But what about the necessity of providing enough adventure hooks for the game to remain interesting? How close together do you place your "adventures"? Do you try to space them out "believably", or do we just assume that the characters happen to be in a weird place in the world where, by some chance, there are two haunted castles and three underground tombs infested with monsters all within 25 miles of each other? Do you spend any effort rationalizing this kind of thing, and how it has come to be?<br/><br/>I also like Mike's approach of handling "danger" (e.g. encounter tables) as a feature of the unexplored: I think it's pretty key, at least for me, to present dangerous and potentially rewarding territory as being a place no one's really delved into before. I'd find it pretty unbelievable, for example, to find the entrance to a massive dungeon full of monsters and treasure next to a major city, without some explanation for why there aren't armed guards standing at the doors and why it hasn't been pillaged, buried, and turned into a prison already. I suppose something along the lines of these places only appearing recently ("a doorway to another world...") could be sufficient, with the characters forming the vanguard of human exploration.<br/><br/>Do you have conceits such as these if and when "adventure potential" crops up in civilized areas? After all, a plague outbreak of zombies could take place in Renaissance Italy, but after the initial event it's not terribly believable to have a group of four middle class nobody heroes dealing with it instead of a regiment of the local military.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430556/#Comment_430556" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-05T06:38:19+00:00" title="April  5, 2014  6:38AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But what about the necessity of providing enough adventure hooks for the game to remain interesting?

As with some of the earlier aspects we've covered, this is also a thing that works surprisingly effortlessly in actual play. I'll try to explain why this seems to be the case, although in practice I just tried it out and found it less problematic than we would assume from an armchair perspective.<br/><br/>Obviously we're applying a healthy amount of PC exceptionalism in that they have the wonderful ability to stumble upon the most interesting things going on in each environment by the virtue of them being our actual playing pieces, and it wouldn't be much of a game if the PCs never found anything interesting. It's not an absolute and automatic guarantee of adventure, but practically the threshold for finding stuff is very low. No different from how Sherlock Holmes regularly gets interesting cases to work on, because otherwise there'd be nothing to tell.<br/><br/>In practice we find that the world is a big place, and it is almost impossible to include so much weirdness that you'd smother the ordinary setting in it. For example, consider the traditional sandbox campaign starter set: a local market town (like thousand denizens total), and three adventure locations in reasonable distance. Reasonable for 1st level characters is basically like under 2 days of travel to one direction. This means that you need to set your three starter adventures within a circle with a diameter of under say a 100 miles, if we assume that the local terrain is basically fit for travel. That's 8,000 square miles. For comparison's sake, that's half the area of the country of the Netherlands; it includes an arbitrary number of small villages, a dozen of such market towns, and multiple large cities, when speaking of a highly urbanized country like that. Alternatively, we can be in a more sparsely populated area, in which case there's more room for the unknown in those dark recesses of the woods where nobody ever goes.<br/><br/>Specifically, a student of folklore might tell you that typical folk legends, what might be termed "local supernatural stories", have a range of like 30 miles or so in most rural environments. Get any farther than that, and the tales might still basically be the same, but they'll be attached to different local landmarks, simply because the people don't just move that far in their ordinary lives. When we replace all this folk legendarium with the presumption that some of these stories are actually true, we get a sense for how much weirdness it is appropriate to have in an area. I would like to claim, based on experience, that credibility is hardly stretched if a colorful village that the players like, with a few recurring NPCs, also has say 1d6 weird local legends, of which about half are shared with other local villages, and of which about half are "true" in the sense that there is an adventure hook associated with them. So this calculation tells us that we can easily have <i>at least</i> one strange adventure per village - and pre-modern farming villages are spaced out with like 10-20 miles between them at most. And that's just the ordinary "white noise" of adventurers traipsing around the countryside, it doesn't take into account the fact that you <i>want</i> to have local curiousities that break the patterns. So <i>in addition</i> to that spooky story the locals tell about a headless horseman that robs people and hides their gold in a bog, that same area might well have adventures the local farmers know nothing about.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can throw usual patterns to the winds and accept that in your campaign PCs actually travel more should I say pulp adventure distances in between adventures. Forget having three adventure locations within a 100 mile circle; rather, give the players a map of say the entire country of France, and make them Richelieu's secret witch hunters. At that point you'll have to literally throw hundreds and thousands of adventure hooks at them before the number starts to look screwy. Sure, they might have to travel a few weeks from place to place, as one week they're in Rouen looking after some werewolf rumours, and the next they're in Paris after the ghouls (which we all know live under the city). That's obviously just an arbitrary example of a historical adventure campaign pattern where it doesn't matter that adventures are hundreds of miles apart - just don't mess with unrealistic travel complications, and perhaps let the players abstract "strategic travel" to speed things up, and there's no reason why things can't be spaced out more than you'd usually see in a D&amp;D sandbox.<br/><br/>In practice I found that I could have like 20 different adventures in a geographical area about the size of the Netherlands, and that didn't start feeling like the weirdness would have broken up the normalcy. Of course the players developed a healthy respect for the wild places, but as there was no clear pattern to the excursions from normalcy, it never became a reason for the PCs to outright discard their worldview or anything like that. It would definitely be different if all 20 of those adventures were about say an Andromedan invasion of the country, then that amount of aberration would definitely have to cause societal reactions. However, as the adventures were mostly about forgotten old ruins, crazy wizards, dangerous animals/monsters, degenerate cults, domestic terrorism... all those are already things that history has in plenty, the fact that the PCs actually believe in werewolves existing (because they're the people who actually go out and encounter them) makes no difference whatsoever to the average burgher.<br/><br/>Also, of course not all adventures are about supernatural weirdness. When the adventure is about some robbers having broken into a family tomb, that shouldn't go on any player's "let's bust the GM for unrealism" list - that's the sort of thing that you'd expect to happen in a non-fantastic world as well.<br/><br/>I can imagine the situation where you have too much weirdness all in one place. Being brazen will basically let that pass - remember, we're deducing things about the nature of the setting on the basis of established facts, rather than trying to find reasons for why the established facts can't be true. Also, you can always find actual connections between strange adventures, which will explain the weirdness peak in a local area - basically the Hellmouth explanation <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>In our campaign one such joint explanation phenomenon was the ancient civilization of Duvan'Ku: the local environs of fantasy-Holland included several adventures involving ancient ruins and crazy wizards. It was natural enough to find subtle connections between these - like, find out that the necromancer is a Duvan'Ku cultist relying on the same magical tools that you found earlier in that old ruin. This kind of strategic development doesn't only deepen the sandbox and make room for higher level adventures (such as one where the PCs travel back in time to confront the evil empire in its own time), but it also helps with the credence issue: five supernatural adventures near the same town, all in a world that is supposedly relatively normal, might look strange otherwise, but when we find out that all five are actually connected, it's no longer that strange - it's really just one anomaly at that point, and the rest of the superficially separate events are causally explained by the root cause.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430580/#Comment_430580" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-06T11:48:47+00:00" title="April  6, 2014 11:48AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff, Eero. I think a large part of this whole process, as I'm looking at it, has to do with actually playing the thing and letting it evolve. As the game develops one step at a time, new creative input can set a larger context for what has come up so far. For instance, I would imagine that, in a game like ours, it could happen that by pure chance a small area would generate an unusual number of rather significant random encounters (like our "black beast" in the woods). If so, I would be tempted to reduce the number of other adventure hooks, and develop adventures based on those random encounters instead. Perhaps the "black beast" would become its own adventure, or I'd find a way to hook it into another adventure (the monster happens to live in the Tower of Love, say).<br/><br/>To change tack entirely, I want to ask you again about hit points. I know that in your vision of D&amp;D, hit points represent a Hollywood-esque plot protection to dramatically significant characters. You've mentioned that you allow certain exceptional attack rolls to "bypass" hit points. How does this work? Does the target automatically die (barring a Death save, I believe, at least for PCs)?<br/><br/>What other circumstances allow damage to "bypass" hit points?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430582/#Comment_430582" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-06T12:55:52+00:00" title="April  6, 2014 12:55PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, a character who is hit and does not have hitpoint protection dies, barring ordinary or extraordinary processes otherwise. It's handled in the same exact manner whether the hitpoints are bypassed or exhausted: if we're doing death saves or whatever for characters at zero HP, then that's what you get when the HPs are bypassed, as well.<br/><br/>(A minor feature of this kind of thinking is that I much prefer having characters at zero HP to still be fighting-fit; in other words, the sudden deathstrike occurs when you can't pay in hitpoints, not when your hitpoint store is exhausted. This is a minuscule difference math-wise - although nearly significant at 1st level - but it just makes more sense to me. For example, it allows me to just say that non-leveled commoners have no hitpoints at all. Were I writing 4th edition with its ample 1 HP mook enemies, this would have been my semantic choice there as well.)<br/><br/>Situations where an attack bypasses hitpoints range from the traditional (poison being probably the most common) to the innovative. In our home game it is the case that a 5th degree success on an attack roll (20 points over opponent defense value) bypasses hitpoints, striking home as if the opponent's HP were exhausted. It's sort of a critical hit, really, ensuring that all combat carries risks that are unmanageable to a degree.<br/><br/>My general philosophy, though, is that hitpoints should provide generally effective tactical safety to characters - I do not desire to go so far with "bypass" effects as to cause hitpoints to seriously depreciate in value as the ultimate dramatic defense. In practice this means that if anything, I'm more prone to moving bypass effects into hitpoint-affecting effects than to invent new ways to bypass HP. For example, I'm quite fond of the 4th edition conceit that spells like say Hold Person only work on targets under a certain hitpoint limit, or they just cause HP damage that might or might not be enough to take you out of a fight. It is indisputable that the maths of the game work out better when certain types of attacks don't arbitrarily bypass hitpoints, but rather that you always have a good, intentional reason for when it happens. I haven't so far instituted these sorts of limitations on the various save or die spells, but that's mostly just because our play is so low-level that this hasn't been much of an issue.<br/><br/>(It would be very easy to copy the mechanism of the Power Word spells and institute a HP limit instead of or in addition to the saving throw in all spells and special attacks and so on that ordinarily bypass hitpoints. For example, Hold Person could say that it works if the opponent fails a save and they are currently at under 5*[caster level} HP. That'll still work on practically anything, but you might have to exhaust some targets a bit before they're properly softened up for magical bondage. Sounds preferable when the alternate option is to have a 10th level fighter be essentially powerless against a 1st level magic-user - and yes, I am aware of all the calculations, I know it comes down to initiative. Still.)<br/><br/>Aside from having critical hits bypass hitpoints (which I think is a good idea, combat should have some uncontrollable risk), two other conditions that have at least some arguments in favour are called shots and surprise attacks. As with the magical special attacks issue discussed above, it is always a good question to ask how far the plot protection provided by hitpoints carries you. Clearly it suffices almost always to help you get out of the way of a lethal sword-swing in a duel, but does your hitpoint "plot armour" make it so that you awaken at the last second to an assassin's knife in the deep of the night, and thus only take HP damage instead of dying, despite having been surprised in your sleep? Perhaps this is necessary, even if it means that a PC never gets to be the cool sniper who takes out the evil warlord from the rooftop with a crossbow. (Assuming the warlord isn't a non-leveled character, anyway.) Either way it goes, I think that it's fruitful to consider this in terms of desirability of plot protection in different situations, rather than as a question of physical robustness or whatever it is that the traditional D&amp;D rabbit hole leads you to.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, my take has generally been that the hitpoint "protection" generally presumes being generally aware of your environment and capable of free movement, and thus I have generally allowed attacks to bypass hitpoints in extremely clear fictional conditions where this has not been the case. If I were really pressed on the matter as a matter of firm systematic ruling, I suspect that I'd end up like fractionalizing hitpoints or something - you lose half your hitpoints (or take double damage, maybe) if you can't move out of the way of a danger, stuff like that. Not elegant to my mind, especially as I already perform similar armor class calculations. Certainly a difficult question when you look at it from up close - in what conditions should hitpoints be ignored as a defense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430597/#Comment_430597" name="Item_229" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-06T21:12:35+00:00" title="April  6, 2014  9:12PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero! You're quite correct that it's not an obvious question, but a fun one to grapple with. As you can see for yourself from my various hacks, I also like the idea that 0 HP does not say anything about a character's physical health, but rather just a... lack of hit points.<br/><br/>As a point of curiosity, does that mean that you've removed Constitution bonuses from hit points, as well? (It's hard to argue that Constitution has anything to do with plot immunity, after all, unless we posit that a character's "constitution" is, retroactively, a measure of their increased plot immunity, such that someone appears more sturdy because that's precisely what our story requires.)<br/><br/>My own solution when I played D&amp;D was similar to yours in terms of critical hits:<br/><br/>I remember that back in my AD&amp;D2E days (the only kind of D&amp;D I really played for any significant length of time), there were some really intense and colourful "critical hit tables", with lots of unpleasant outcomes like broken legs and memory loss and whatever.<br/><br/>The idea I came up with was that when attacks seemed to have a chance to bypass cool badass hero stuff counted as critical hits and warranted one or more rolls on those tables. The hypothetical knife stab in the middle of the night wouldn't kill you, it would just do the usual amount of hit point damage. However, it would have other effects, maybe leaving you bleeding heavily or unable to hear out of one ear or something (kind of like your "death crosses", in retrospect).<br/><br/>Hit points, then, represent not so much your ability to dodge injury but your ability to avoid death even in unlikely circumstances. (Falling from a great height similarly caused multiple rolls on the critical hit tables, if it was from high enough.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430598/#Comment_430598" name="Item_230" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-06T21:29:02+00:00" title="April  6, 2014  9:29PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Also, does this mean that non-lethal damage which bypasses hit points is handled purely in-fiction/by fiat?

It's one of those too passive armchair general things that I guess sort of makes sense in a theoretical way, but does not actually account for tactical success or failure in the source material, and is therefore unnecessary. For the things where Constitution matters I find that a more general Stamina score, encompassing both Strength and Constitution, serves just as well. Or if not that, then a Feat that gives you a hefty bonus for general health. You might be surprised how few players actually care about having "I'm a healthy specimen" as part of their character concept when they actually have to pick it instead of just getting it randomly with a high Con score <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Surgery would typically be cause for a saving throw rather than hitpoint damage - it bypasses hitpoints, not being an action movie hazard. I try to be logical about hitpoints not being a measure of physical robustness. The whole point of differentiating at all between action hazard survivability and general survivability is to maintain the sense that the characters are still strictly speaking human, with human limitations, and it's not a superpower that's keeping them standing where lesser men fall - not a superpower, but rather a combination of luck, fate and such immeasurables. Characters themselves don't know that they have hitpoints, and they can't test for their existence by knifing themselves and seeing if they bleed - they do.<br/><br/>It would certainly be entirely modern to have hitpoints be an absolute measure of survival - a formalistic rule that says you can't be out of the game as long as you have hitpoints, no matter what. Like, you fall off a ship in a storm, the GM assigns 1d6 hp attrition per hex to closest shore and if you can pay that, you have subjective guarantee of washing up on land later on. (This would be entirely in line with the case of falling out of the window of a tower, well established as something that is primarily resolved by hitpoint damage.) This would be a very "Forgite" way of thinking about hitpoints, just throw out all the vagueness about when a high-level character is vulnerable and when they aren't. You got the points, you have a subjective right to survival.<br/><br/>Would have to mess with the hp recovery rules somewhat with such a change, of course. My current rules in that regard are predicated on hitpoints being primarily an issue of "action scene" arcs, where characters regain most of their hp in between individual crisis situations. This makes less sense in a mechanical environment where you might e.g. try to reduce somebody's hitpoints to zero by debating them or something, so that they could be removed from the game, TSoY-like.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430612/#Comment_430612" name="Item_232" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T06:06:51+00:00" title="April  7, 2014  6:06AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My feeling is that the specific Attributes are probably the first thing you could ditch when evaluating the rules and still be safely in D&amp;D territory.

Sort of a sop thrown to players to appease their desire for characterization. Historically they developed into a central importance, but one could go in different directions as well for a quite interesting set-up; we often discuss the relative benefits of having attributes be more or less important.<br/><br/>Personally I favour either using a different attribute set (the classic D&amp;D set gets a bit long in the tooth for me, is the simple way to express it) and building an universal resolution mechanic on top of it like Tunnels &amp; Trolls, or removing attributes altogether. I find the classic formula of having attributes but only using the kinda-sorta now and then to be pretty inefficient; players use them for roleplaying characterization, they pay a lot of attention to them, and it's all basically deceptive, as in reality the attributes don't amount to that much. It's sort of like giving the players a plush toy to hug while you send them into dark woods; might make them feel better, but does nothing for their understanding of the actual game mechanics.<br/><br/>As we've seen in the IRC play, I have a strong instinctive tendency for utilizing attribute-related mechanics heavily even in Basic D&amp;D. Attribute checks, and adding the attribute modifier to all sorts of other situations. Illustrates how I work instinctually right now when thrust into driving the Moldvay vehicle, but perhaps not that indicative of what I get up to when I cook up mechanical solutions from the ground up.<br/><br/>Three interesting philosophical approaches to the role of the base attribute array in D&amp;D that I've considered:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> Universal resolution with degrees of success built on top of a flexible attribute array, made into the central pivot upon which lesser character elements (e.g. class and level) turn. Modern approach, excepting the lack of a skill overlay. This is what our big campaign utilized. Note that the attribute array does not have to be static, nor does it have to prevent exact character spec where desired; for example, I had rules procedure for deriving or subsuming individual attributes should we decide to get rid of Will (the attribute that I mostly considered dropping) or reinstitute Agility (which was also considered in my one-physical-attribute scheme). The attribute scheme also technically speaking recognized "specialized modifiers" - some few characters had scores like "Stamina 14, +2 Strength" to indicate their capabilities more clearly.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Remove the attributes entirely, and replace them with personal qualities. Two 1st level Fighters would be mechanically identical by definition, with the only exception being if one or the other would happen to have some personal qualities that would distinguish them. Feat-like things, such as "Waste-born: +2 to survival checks". I've been considering running something like this for a few years, could be interesting; I would likely have the players roll up personal qualities for their characters in a sort of Traveller-esque life tree chargen process.<br/><br/>(Note that even in the most attribute-excising version of the rules that I consider seriously I don't actually remove all personal differentiation between characters; I find both the random element and the personalized element very important to D&amp;D character development dynamics, it simply wouldn't be the same if two 1st level Fighters were genuinely exactly identical all the time.)<br/><br/><b>3)</b> Keep attributes, but rework the procedures so that they're genuinely never used in resolution procedures, and therefore attribute modifiers are also never needed; instead, attributes act as funnels and abstractions of downtime activities, and as characterization aids in roleplaying. Appropriate uses in this strategy would be as limitations upon class entry (to be a Fighter you got to have minimum 12 Strength, for example), as cause for bonus experience points, as feat requirements, and limitations upon logistical maneuvers (Cha limit on how many retainers you may maintain, for example). For actual tactical play, though, attributes would be set aside and you'd play strictly upon the mechanical landscape that may or may not include some stuff derived from the attributes earlier. Want your great Strength to matter in combat, get a weapon or combat technique or something that leverages it in concrete terms, rather than just adding your Str modifier to attack automatically. In this strategy attributes determine who you are in general and vague terms, yet do not directly affect moment-to-moment resolution procedures at all; a subtle difference, and one that might well inspire some quite powerful mechanical innovations if strictly implemented.<br/><br/>To clarify, the point of listing the above alternative models is that I personally find them interesting, elegant or beautiful as mechanical design directions - not saying that there's anything wrong with the sort of mixed-qualities system that by the book D&amp;D uses, except that I find it somewhat confusing and unruly in play; a system that flows more logically from first principles is easier for me to use and appreciate, as there's less arbitrary choice between entirely different yet overlapping game mechanics to consider.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430616/#Comment_430616" name="Item_234" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T07:36:08+00:00" title="April  7, 2014  7:36AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2014 7:36AM by Crunch.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OED has this on the etymology. \n<blockquote>Etymology:  &lt; Anglo-Norman and Middle French monstre, moustre, French monstre (mid 12th cent. in Old French as mostre in sense \u2018prodigy, marvel\u2019, first half of the 13th cent. in senses \u2018disfigured person\u2019 and \u2018misshapen being\u2019, c1223 in extended sense applied to a pagan, first half of the 18th cent. by antiphrasis denoting an extraordinarily attractive thing) &lt; classical Latin m\u014dnstrum portent, prodigy, monstrous creature, wicked person, monstrous act, atrocity &lt; the base of mon\u0113re to warn (see moneo n.; for the formation compare perhaps l\u016bstrum lustrum n.).

So we really must say "by <i>normal</i> humans" (whatever "normal" means).  Certainly this leaves in a species-ist element, whereby any species considered "ugly" or "wicked" (by normal humans) could rightfully be called a "monster" (by those normal humans).<br/><br/>(Despite this, it seems that literally speaking, a giant could be called a monster even if it was handsome and friendly.)<br/><br/>Etymology: from the Middle English <i>monstre </i> &lt; Latin <i>m\u014dnstrum</i> -- portent, unnatural event, monster, equivalent to <i>mon ( \u0113re )</i> [to warn] + <i>-strum</i> [noun suffix]<br/><br/>The etymology suggests that a monster is simply "something warned about".</blockquote>\nI think the OED definition is interesting for a couple of reasons actually.

We generally tend to speak of "healing" spells, but it's understood to be strictly a technical term, and what actually occurs when hitpoints are recovered is ordinary post-combat recovery: you get your stamina back, you deal with the psychological issues, you get your courage back, the audience gets used to you having survived, whatever. This is in a context where the majority of hitpoint recovery happens through a "short rest" that takes a Turn and gets you most of your hitpoints back, most of the time.<br/><br/>This is separate from actual fictional healing, which can be natural, medical or magical in nature. That type generally speaking doesn't have direct hitpoint meaning, but you'd generally get much of your hitpoints back as a side effect when hit by a magic that restores your broken bones or whatever.\n<blockquote>Also, I get what it feels like to have HP whittled down in a single fight causing impending tension - I haven't been stabbed yet but it's clear that this enemy is closing in for a killing blow. But what about when you lose a few HP in one battle, a few in another, and you're on one or zero hit points, but it's been ages since you were under threat, and now a goblin turns up? Mechanically we know that death is on the table, but fictionally, how do we make that tally? Or is this a case of dramatic irony at work, where we know that the character, somehow is marked for death, but they might not?</blockquote>\nI personally deal with it by the fact that your hitpoint total sort of aligns with how tired you are; you can always get much of your hitpoints back by a short rest if you just have a couple of minutes to catch your breath. This slowly stops working through the day (you get less and less back with each short rest), but generally speaking we rarely face a situation where a character is extremely low in hitpoints unless it is also a situation where the character is exhausted, either because they just came out of a fight (with no chance to rest in between), or because they've been fighting (and taking short rests) for the entire day, and therefore simply can't get up to their normal hitpoints anymore today.<br/><br/>All this means that for our particular mechanization your scenario is unproblematic: it makes perfect sense that a dead-tired character forced into a swordfight will soon be dead as well as tired.<br/><br/>Other specific mechanizations have their own problems with hitpoints, but I find that for me personally aligning hitpoints fictionally with concepts like tiredness and stamina works quite well. Of course you'll make that lethal mistake when you're at your most tired. And of course you can recover most of your strength between combats if you'll only get to catch your breath. I would hazard that most people would find this concept of "hitpoints are stamina" to be a blindingly natural thing in comparison to the standard, if they tried it out a bit. It is always a small mystery as to what the traditional hitpoint is even supposed to be measuring, considering that it doesn't impact your combat effectiveness until you run out, but it also apparently only comes back after days and days of complete rest. I know that the traditional explanation is "bruises and scratches", but those of course don't accumulate into a killing blow the way hitpoint loss does - not without the fatigue element. My closest guess is PTSD, really - I could see myself modeling that with mechanics sort of close to how the traditional hitpoint works, in that you pile on stress until you become non-functional, and it can only be managed by extended and regular breaks away from combat <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(Ultimately hitpoints are of course an abstract pacing mechanic. I'm just engaging into fictional explanations because the question was how we end up explaining these things in play. The important procedural point for me is that this fabulation is something we do because we feel like it in play - there's no dogmatic reason to have a single truth available about hitpoints. Some mechanizations just make explaining things easier and more natural, while with others you just have to ignore how it works for the most part.)<br/><br/>Ultimately dramatic irony is, of course, not a problem. It is inherently present if you play D&amp;D combat mechanics "realistically", so that the characters themselves don't know that they have hitpoints. Two men go over the trench wall, but we the players know that only one of them is in danger of dying of the 1d6 damage immediately inflicted by enemy machine gun fire; one is an ordinary soldier, while the other is a 3rd level fighter, you see. This is why D&amp;D is a heroic game at higher levels, once you drag yourself up to that level: after having experienced the deadliness of it in your guts, you get to enjoy having plot armor. Our local group up north used to call this psychological experience "coasting" - it is quite relaxing to be the fighter with like 15 hitpoints in a world where everybody else has about 5; you can get into the middle of melee and even come back when hit, all without being in serious danger of dying by accident.\n<blockquote>- similarly, how about traps? Would you tend to use a saving throw? Or do projectiles always miss you unless they kill you?</blockquote>\nDepends on the nature of the trap. As I discussed above, I have a theoretical leaning towards bringing more things into hitpoints, but in practice I follow the module text when running modules. After having done a few weeks of gameplay in whatever mechanical context I'll also use those conceits when GMing myself.<br/><br/>Having a fall into a pit cause hitpoint damage does not seem any more problematic to me whether I interpret hitpoints as drama protection, or as physical well-being. In both cases I have to basically just check whether hitpoints ran out, and if they didn't, then apparently that fall wasn't so bad after all. Of course the fall marked this guy for death later, sort of - now he'll fall to the next swordblow, where before that fall he would've survived one. Here the drama shield explanation actually fares better than the physical welfare explanation: there's no earthly reason why a fall that at most scratched a knee would make you markedly more likely to die in the following swordfight, while the dramatic conceit that you deserve to die now for dodging death earlier makes just as much sense as the whole concept of dramatic protection does in the first place.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the theory of dramatic protection fits well this idea that regularly comes up, where players know their HD, but not their HP. If it wasn't a pain in the ass to apply, I'd probably use it myself. Quite sensible for the players to have some vague sense of how much their character can get away with, but no exact knowledge. Of course the randomized damage already gets us about half of the effect, without having to centralize and blind the book-keeping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430647/#Comment_430647" name="Item_241" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T15:41:35+00:00" title="April  7, 2014  3:41PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Eero on this one.<br/><br/>The whole concept of "healing" for hit points has never made sense to begin with - it doesn't represent anything we can point to sensibly as representative of some aspect of fiction, with the possible exception of pure mass (which sometimes appears to be the case with monsters, but not generally with chararacters). If hit points are actual, physical damage, then high-level characters should have healing scaled to their hit point total. If hit point are stamina and luck that kind of thing, then we don't know why having dodged a blow from a poisoned bastard sword would take longer to "heal" from than dodging a thrown javelin, and so on. <br/><br/>Eero's concept of PTSD is perhaps the only reasonably sensible one I've seen which holds up under most scrutiny, and explains how, for example, a "Cure Light Wounds" spell (which obviously does nothing of the sort*) consistently heals 1d8 hit points no matter who it's applied to.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I've come to the conclusion that dealing with hit points as anything other than some kind of meta-measurement of something well outside the scope of the fiction (such as "plot immunity") is a losing proposition.<br/><br/><br/>*: After all, this spell does little good to a high-level character who's just narrowly avoided death for the tenth time, but easily brings back to full health someone inexperienced, even if they had their guts torn out and were on the verge of death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430670/#Comment_430670" name="Item_242" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T03:52:54+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  3:52AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With that kind of approach, Eero, do more minor wounds get much of a chance to be involved in the fictional positioning?

Are these just not an area of focus in the games you've played in so far, and so you haven't encumbered yourself with additional rules and book-keeping to deal with them?

That is, characters are generally not expected to suffer any as long as they have their hitpoints. This is, after all, D&amp;D, with its basic presumption that we do not generally desire to track deterioration of combat condition. When D&amp;D talks of "minor" wounds, it generally speaking means cinematic injuries that look like you've been in a fight but do not actually affect your capabilities mechanically.<br/><br/>The way our home system deals with tactical damage (that is, injuries that have mechanical effect but do not outright take you out of the fight) is basically like so: when you're out of hitpoints or suffer a critical hit for some other reason, you make a save to see if the hit is actually critical, or merely significant. Failure indicates that you're out of the fight, while success indicates that you're still capable of combat, although with a possible minor issue such as the ones you mention. This basically means that most characters are out of a fight after the first real hit (as befits realism), but some particularly vigorous or desperate individuals might refuse to go down, and they might thus take a few more hits before their accumulated injuries force them to fail organically.<br/><br/>Another way for such tactical damage to occur in the home system is via the stunts system - when an attack roll is exceptionally good (measured by passing the opponent AC by a multiple of five points), the player may "stunt" to expend these "extra successes" for various effects. One typical thing, provided that the nature of combat and armament allows, is for a player to describe a minor injury that causes some penalty to the opponent. Blinding them with dirt or their own blood is a typical example - 1 degree for momentary blindness (one round, basically), 2 degrees for a thorough mess (taking an entire round to clear, or preferably a break in the action).<br/><br/>So I'd say that our home system does account for minor tactical injuries of the like you mention, it's just that they're not mixed in with the hitpoints issue at all - they're either imposed by the opponent (not necessarily intentionally; stunting doesn't need to imply that the attacker tried to cause that exact thing to occur) or happen as a less serious alternative from critical hits.<br/><br/>It is technically speaking possible to "bypass the HP" as we say in this system by accumulating fictional positioning that leaves the opponent practically incapable of fighting, despite still having plenty of hitpoints. As I've discussed above, I'm of a mixed mind about this; it makes sense, and is allowed by the logic of the combat system, but it also breaks the currency system of the game. Basically the problem is that if you allow a character with massive amounts of hitpoints to be brought down by blinding, spraining, wrestling, tying, followed by a coup de grace on a helpless opponent, then that becomes the favoured method of dealing with any opponent with an amount of hitpoints clearly dominant over your own capability to deal hitpoint damage. This is ultimately the same question as the one dealt with earlier: what do you do when a character is attacked unawares, in a non-combat situation, perhaps when they've been tied down? Save vs. death, automatic death, or merely reduce hitpoints and see what happens next? Should hitpoints imply subjective survival rights, such that you <i>can't</i> slay an opponent who surrenders before they run out of hitpoints?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430673/#Comment_430673" name="Item_244" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T04:22:00+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  4:22AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The nuance of what happened if you passed a save vs critical hit roll was what I was missing from my picture of your system.

Most of the time we rely on cornerstones: cruel and merciless world, this same setting we had last time, how are we going to make our fortune, one foot-loose adventurer per player, start at 1st level, intriguing and mysterious adventure hooks.<br/><br/>Technically speaking any of those basic assumptions can be questioned, but again, the aesthetically pleasing way to do that is the conceit of negotiation-via-play: instead of you the player arguing with me the GM about whether you should take three or four characters into the adventure, we can have your character go to the Mercenary Market to see if he can hire some colorful characters to help him. This is the same thing regardless of that in-character color - we're negotiating how many adventurers I'm willing to have try my adventure - but we're dressing it up in fiction to get arbitrary constraint ("Oh, seems like your Cha check failed, so I have the advantage in this negotiation.") and to develop the narrative that legitimizes the triumph or loss that comes later. It is more fun to say that your character tried and failed to attract talent into his risky exploit than to say that you threw the coin with Bob the GM and then he refused to let you have more than two characters for your army.<br/><br/>As for why I generally prefer one PC + a bunch of retainers over e.g. 3 PCs, it's simply because the former provides sharper tactical narratives that are more true to life: one player playing three PCs uses their characters as pawns and does not have a firm character viewpoint to the action, while the same player with one PC will have to suffer the limits of individual, mortal viewpoint: their character doesn't know everything that's going on all at once, the retainers might disagree with him or even mutiny, his commands might be misunderstood in the heat of battle, and so on. The difference is subtle and to a degree semantic, but it has real impact on the style of play.<br/><br/>And of course, the reason for why we don't change the ratio of characters to players in the middle of a scenario is to prevent gaming the scenario: you can't bring more tactical resources into play by rolling up more characters in the middle of the expedition. This conceit is only relaxed for the even more important principle that "everybody gets to play": you don't have a character, you get to roll a new one and we'll introduce him into the scenario.<br/><br/>All of the above matters more than the IRC medium to me; the reason why I clearly prefer one character to a player when I'm running the game is that I want the players to each have a clear and limited character viewpoint (as opposed to a deity-like bird's eye view with an arbitrary number of character resources at his disposal), not because I couldn't handle players each having more characters. I always tell the players that they can hire a staff if they think they can't tackle an adventure without; if they're too poor to hire a staff, then they can hire onto the entourage of some NPC, like the characters did in the IRC game on Sunday by joining captain Harker's ship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431006/#Comment_431006" name="Item_248" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-15T05:16:42+00:00" title="April 15, 2014  5:16AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool; great answers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431020/#Comment_431020" name="Item_249" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-15T09:14:35+00:00" title="April 15, 2014  9:14AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep.

Entirely by the book as far as I'm concerned. The GM has the responsibility to call any combat that's already been practically resolved - no need to roll dice in the usual grind.<br/><br/>The procedure I use is that the GM offers a "deal" to the players, and once they accept, we can end the combat. The GM of course tries the get the players to accept some attrition in exchange for winning the fight, while the players might ask for easier terms if they feel that the fight favours their side. If no agreement is reached, the combat continues until it resolves in the ordinary way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div

However, as the GM I only accept deals when I am not interested myself in rolling out the combat. The players will offer to deal when they want a combat to end, which is almost always because it's slow and boring and a done deal.<br/><br/>Generally the likeliest combats that are like this with us have involved unintelligent opposition engaged with extreme advantages, such as mantlet shields + chain mail + clubs against ordinary D&amp;D skeletons in a narrow hallway - that's the sort of match-up that the humans will take 99 times of a hundred, so no real reason to waste time rolling dozens and dozens of dice for it.<br/><br/>The other situation is when the stakes are very low and the odds very high in favour of the PCs. For example, a part of 20 mercenaries ambushing three goblins. I might offer a 1/3 that one of the mercenaries takes a hit. If the players care, they might even refuse that an micromanage to attempt to avoid even that little bit of attrition.<br/><br/>Combats against intelligent opposition rarely end with a deal because of how important a factor morale is - the opponent might break any minute, so it doesn't hurt to roll another round of combat to see. I could well say that the native D&amp;D solution to stretching combat is morale, and it is a good one; if I changed all morale-free opponents into intelligent ones that'll escape when they've lost, there would basically never be a need for cutting combat short with a deal.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431053/#Comment_431053" name="Item_253" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-15T17:06:24+00:00" title="April 15, 2014  5:06PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Eero and Paul!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431067/#Comment_431067" name="Item_254" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-15T21:28:46+00:00" title="April 15, 2014  9:28PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> there would basically never be a need for cutting combat short with a deal.<br/></blockquote>\n...except for real life issues, of course, right?

Although with low-level OSR going into a dungeon undermanned and with poor info is tantamount to death, so perhaps we should be more thorough with these merchants?  <br/><br/>Personally, I'd be excited to see combat pared down into something resembling <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> where combat is about two opposing teams duking it out rather than following all individual behaviours of each combatant. Nowhere in D&amp;D do we have so much focus on what each PC and NPC is doing moment-to-moment. We're all aware of the statistics - we don't need to draw out the suspense. I'd much rather see a competitive resolution between two parties (whose attributes are calculated by its member's tactics, equipment and stats) with individuals electing to take "heroic action" as a notable event in the hectic melee rather than just hold the rear. Your party loosing the melee generates all kinds of fall-out and immediate decisions- flee or face further casualties, etc. Taking heroic action (like challenging the Snakeman Chief to manly single combat) would also expose you to the worst of the fighting fall-out - being a hero is the quickest way to die, always.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431105/#Comment_431105" name="Item_256" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T08:56:00+00:00" title="April 16, 2014  8:56AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a very cool idea.

I could see handling this kind of thing a little bit like Apocalypse World, however: you roll some dice and see whether you drive off the enemy (decent success), slaughter or capture them (great success), take damage (failure), or have a difficult tactical choice to make (partial result).<br/><br/>On a failure, the enemy deals its damage to the group, so failing against a large group of aggressive enemies might be lethal. Straight-up success should be rare, unless the group has the situation under control and has set things up in their favour (e.g. an ambush).<br/><br/>The tactical decisions, though, would be the meat of this system. You might have to choose full-unit tactics like a fighting retreat versus staying in the fight and suffering losses, losing ground (or hirelings bolting for the exit), surrendering or heavy losses. Or maybe the GM would be picking from some unfortunate options for the party, perhaps depending on who had initiative - the PCs or the monsters.<br/><br/>The fun part would be, as you suggest, in individual actions. Heroic characters could attempt desperate feats in order to change the outcome of the fight. The stakes would be high: on a success, the desperate maneuver could upgrade the result of combat one category better. On a failure, that character would take heavy damage (or risk capture or whatever) and possibly land the others in deeper waters, too.<br/><br/>This sounds like it could be fun. Imagine rolling well and routing a group of goblins, sending them fleeing down the corridors of the dungeon. However, we know that if they get away, they might alert the demons below, spoiling our plan. One of the heroes (perhaps a Thief) was lurking further down the tunnels, so he announces that he will attempt a desperate feat to improve this result. He leaps out into the path of the fleeing goblins, yelling and brandishing his sword. If he fails, he's overrun and probably run through by a goblin spear. But if he succeeds, he might be able to hold back the goblins or delay them long enough to upgrade the decent success into a great success: the party catches up to the goblins, surrounds them and now has the option of slaughtering or taking them captive.<br/><br/>Is that the kind of thing you had in mind?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431166/#Comment_431166" name="Item_259" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-17T04:22:55+00:00" title="April 17, 2014  4:22AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds pretty good to me. Yes, you've caught the idea of player action being expressed through coherent tactical decisions rather than individual action (for the most part). <br/><br/>The playgroup would have to be pretty hygienic about losses. If the tactical interplay concludes that the Goblins have found you under-strength and uncoordinated, and the subsequent roll indicates that several party members sustain wounds then the DM and the Players are going to need a system to negotiate <i>who </i>is wounded in the end. Rolling for it is fine, as is a more protracted conversation about comparable loss. <br/><br/>I imagine a Party Cohesion Score (higher when the party is moving carefully in marching order, lower when members are off elsewhere, distracted or disorganised) or something will be useful when testing to see if the Goblins have ambushed the party or <i>vice versa</i>. I recall Paranoia had a similar "stress level" party-DC or something that would rocket up in bad situations to make life harder for the players when shit was hitting the fan and time is an issue.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431193/#Comment_431193" name="Item_260" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-17T10:54:19+00:00" title="April 17, 2014 10:54AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh Mike, your loyal disciples are pining for you tonight.

I decided to go with Eero's rule on hitpoints - in that there are no max hp, you just reroll your hit dice every time you rest and that becomes your new current hp.<br/><br/>An interesting side-effect of this that I hadn't really thought through beforehand was that, as a simplifying procedure, I didn't ask players to roll these hitpoints until there was a situation that needed them. For example, when hexcrawling they travelled for two and a half days, with rests at night, but only encountered a monster on the second night. At that point I asked them to roll both hp and initiative. (People who had just woken up rolled 2d6 HD and took the lowest as their hp - not sure if I'll keep with that. A penalty to initiative for being sleepy makes more sense to me).<br/><br/>So when they rest we don't actually reroll hp - we just rub out the previous value. When they began exploring the Tower of the Stargazer no one had a hitpoint score. It was only when Able the questing nobleman's son fell down some stairs and took d6 damage that he also rolled d6 to find out how many hitpoints he had (only 2, alas).<br/><br/>I thought this was interesting in relation to the conversation about hidden hp earlier in this thread. It was generally agreed above that it was a pain procedurally. But with this approach, I'm perfectly happy for them to know their hp between when they first take damage and when they next rest. But between resting and the first time hp comes up it's simple to keep it unknown. Very neat.<br/><br/>This has the effect of making it so that players can't put the person who has low hp to the back as it's really not clear who they are. Whether this is a good thing or not... I quite like it, but it does give the players even less knowledge with which to make good tactical decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431643/#Comment_431643" name="Item_263" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T03:58:20+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  3:58AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, I wouldn't have thought of that.

Of course D&amp;D is possible without hitpoints or reduced hitpoints (one HP per level for everybody is an interestingly constrained variation, for example), but that 1d6 per level is such a cornerstone that I don't wonder at all if a given GM or group wants to retain it.<br/><br/>In our play the balance I've struck regarding those variable hitpoints is as suggested above by Martin: it's up to each individual player whether they want to be maintaining a hit point balance at any given time. Thus it is likely that characters floating in downtime-ish circumstances won't have a HP total, but as the degree of tactical spec increases, first the more analytical players and then the more casual ones start rolling them to have more sense of their odds for the day.<br/><br/>Limiting the shift from unknown hp to known hp to the moment of first injury is an entirely possible variation. The main reason why it's been a rare phenomenon with us (it has happened, it's just that usually the players want to know a bit earlier) is probably the great prominence of a specific Fighter perk: there's one that not only changes your hit dice to d8s, but also allows you to selectively keep your old hp total when rerolling them. This means that a significant fraction of the characters tend to have an existing HP total at all times, even when they haven't been fighting for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431672/#Comment_431672" name="Item_274" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T19:03:21+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  7:03PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting to me:<br/><br/>Why do people feel that rolling HP at the moment of injury is more dangerous/risky than rolling in advance?<br/><br/>The only difference I can see is that, under the normal rules, low-HP characters have a chance to know in advance that they are "weak", and therefore try to avoid danger. High-HP characters can know in advance that they're more likely to survive certain dangers, and can do so consistently from adventure to adventure. But, aside from that, your odds of dying (or whatever outcome) are no different from ordinary play.<br/><br/>It may seem like it's more random, but it's not, really: it's just that the two rolls (HP and damage) are happening at two different moments in time rather than simultaneously. <br/><br/>I, personally, have an issue (from a design perspective) with the way HP are determined in low-level D&amp;D; it's just too wide a range of results for the kind of gameplay we want. It makes no sense to me that a 1st-level character might have 700% more hit points than his peer, despite all else being equal. It's also uninteresting (to me, at least) to play a game where we know for a fact that Mike's PC is guaranteed to survive the first blow, no matter what (true under many versions of D&amp;D rules), while Eero's, with only 1 hit point, is *guaranteed* to die from any blow or injury received. <br/><br/>My personal variation on this has two possible states for characters:<br/><br/>1. The character is unharmed, fully healed. No HP total, just hit dice.<br/>2. The character is wounded; a hit point total is recorded to reflect their current state, and erased when they heal.<br/><br/>However, I think this works best when the range for HP is not so "swingy" or so large (as is the case for higher-level characters, for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431673/#Comment_431673" name="Item_275" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T19:20:31+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  7:20PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It may seem like it's more random, but it's not, really: it's just that the two rolls (HP and damage) are happening at two different moments in time rather than simultaneously.</blockquote>\nIt's not just that, right?

However, you have a bit of problem when a series of lucky rolls can have your 1st-level Fighter surviving 12 blows from a frightening monster, with no reduction in future chances of death. I mean, it's not necessarily a *problem*, but it might feel a bit funny that this same dude can go take *another* arrow in the chest with only a 1-in-6 chance of snuffing it.<br/><br/>I would do it like this, personally (and in D&amp;D-esque games, I tend to adopt a rule like this for monsters instead of tracking hit points in any case):<br/><br/>* Everything does 1d6 damage. (Or maybe really scary things are d6+1, d6+2... EDIT: roll extra dice and keep the best! That's a better match here.)<br/><br/>When you get hit, check the amount of damage against your personal scores:<br/><br/>* You <i>die</i> if the damage total is...<br/><i>- Magic-User: 3+level (i.e. 4+ for 1st-level)<br/>- Thief/Cleric: 4+level (i.e. 5+ for 1st-level)<br/>- Fighter: 5+level (i.e. 6+ for 1st-level)<br/></i><br/>* You are <i>wounded</i> if the damage total is...<br/><i>- Unarmoured: 1+<br/>- Wearing armour: 2+<br/>- Wearing really heavy armour: 3+<br/></i><br/><br/>When you are <i>wounded</i>, decrease your "if you die" number by 1 until you have a chance to heal your wounds.<br/><br/>This models current levels of deadliness in standard D&amp;D pretty well, actually. A third-level Thief with 3d6 hit points can take two to four hits before going down. Under this system, he has a "dead" number of 7+, so the first hit is just an injury, the second kills him on a 6, and the third on a 5-6, and the fourth on a 4-6. (Cumulatively, 17% chance of dying on the second blow, 44% chance of dying with the third blow, and 72% chance of dying with the fourth blow. With D&amp;D hit points, assuming the Thief has 10.5 hit points, that would be a 0% chance of death on the first blow, a 17% chance on the second, 62% on the third.)<br/><br/>If you want to work Consitution and stuff like that into this, have it come into play in the "healing" part of the rules. Maybe you normally only heal overnight under safe conditions, but a Constitution check can "heal" one level of damage even in a short rest or under inhospitable circumstances. Then you can still have "hardy" characters, who seem to bounce back easily from an injury, versus "sickly" ones, who need extended bed-rest to do the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431675/#Comment_431675" name="Item_277" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T19:31:46+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  7:31PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Veav,<br/><br/>I don't know.

Heavy crossbows can fire further more accurately.<br/><br/>So far he hasn't fired it and hit anything, so damage hasn't come up. But it feels to me like, at least at short range, the heavy crossbow should do at least a little more than a light crossbow - maybe 1d6+1 - because it's launching bigger, heavier, thicker bolts with more force.<br/><br/>So there seem to be verisimilitude reasons for varying the damage, and also game/challenge ones: A mechanically differentiated set of weaponry gives interesting choices. I'm sure my player thought that when he chose the heavy crossbow he thought he was making a trade-off between having a light weapon that wouldn't slow him down and a powerful slow thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431683/#Comment_431683" name="Item_281" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T01:36:04+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  1:36AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are differences between the crossbows in LotFP: light crossbow fires every second round and ignores 2 points of AC, heavy fires every three rounds and ignores 4 points of AC.<br/><br/>For me there is no verisimilitude reasons for variable damage with bigger weapons because I refute the premise that hit points are physiological, and damage rolls mechanical (in the physics sense); that is, a character does not have X HP because they have so much flesh and blood and bones, and neither does their weapon cause Y points of damage because it weights this much or is swung with that much force. I understand that if one ascribes to one or both of those viewpoints (physiological hit points, mechanical force of a swing as determinant of damage), then it's almost mandatory to have higher damage for bigger weapons. As I don't, however, I don't have that difficulty.<br/><br/>LotFP isn't hardcore about the static damage dice, by the way - different weapons do different amounts of damage in it. I know that the book is laid out quite confusingly when it comes to weapons stats, so it's not always easy to notice all the details.\n<blockquote>What is the reason so many OSR-people have for keeping damage to always/nearly always 1d6? Coming from 3rd Ed as I am, it's requiring some adjustment in my thinking. I get that there is certain verisimilitude to it, in that a dagger can kill someone just as dead as big two-handed sword. Is it just for simplicity?</blockquote>\nFor me personally it's a realism/consistency thing - I didn't set out to have largely static damage dice, that just happened as a result of the various basic assumptions I made. Once your basic unit of fictional establishment in combat is "a successful attack", and your basic resource are hit points understood as a dramatic protection, it makes perfect sense for each "successful attack" to shave off the same amount of "dramatic protection".<br/><br/>This thinking might be easier to understand if you imagine it this way: each character gets hit points equal to their level, and each successful attack takes off one hit point. So a 3rd level character can take three successful attacks before being taken out. It's an extremely simplified model of combat where "level" is all. Now can you see how one might desire to not have some attacks be "more successful" than others, just because they were made with weapons that are arbitrarily (and unrealistically) considered more lethal? Fact of the matter is that a successful attack is debilitating, incapacitating, when made with near any weapon, when considered at this level of abstraction.<br/><br/>(A side point that is <i>very</i> useful to understand: justifying a conceit with realism does not work when the proposed more realistic solution is inconsistent with the general strategy of fictional parsing that the game is using. In other words, it is not realistic to be selectively realistic. D&amp;D historically suffers from massive amounts of arbitrary realism, partly because Gygax was very vulnerable to going on unnecessary side treks that over-emphasized various fictional factors over others, all according to what happened to interest him on a given rainy day. Bigger weapon = bigger damage is an excellent example of this problem with inconsistent level of abstraction, as it's a rule that would make perfect sense in a game with blow-by-blow biomechanical force feedback one second combat round rules system, while being completely irrelevant to the level of abstraction that D&amp;D rules apply.)<br/><br/>Once you grok how this logic works in that "one hit point, one attack" scheme, imagine that instead of having one hit point vs. one point shaven off for each successful attack, we instead have an uncertainty: sometimes that successful attack takes out one hit point, sometimes it takes two, sometimes it takes half. The point of this variation is to increase uncertainty and confusion to the combat simulation; we acknowledge and appreciate that the simulation is simple, and we compensate by increasing uncertainty factor. This strategy of glossing over fictional complexity with randomness is a general approach that D&amp;D takes, and very successfully, too: almost always when dice are being rolled in D&amp;D, it's because we're glossing a bunch of presumably available fictional details into a highly abstracted dice roll that doesn't tell us how and why things happen exactly, but it does tell us what the outcome is.<br/><br/>When you've decided that it's a good idea to have a successful attack's actual impact on hitpoints be variable, it makes sense blow up your hit points and damage points: instead of every character getting 1 hit point per level, you have each get 1d6 points, and instead of each successful attack causing 1 point of damage, they each cause 1d6 points. You'll note that this is mathematically identical to 1 hp and 1 damage per attack with a suitable fractional random element to each; it's just that multiplying these supposed fractional random distributions by a factor of 6 makes it easier for us to produce the numbers at the gaming table <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431684/#Comment_431684" name="Item_282" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T01:36:13+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  1:36AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for why it's 1d6 per HD and 1d6 per attack, that's to a great degree an accident of history. Six-sided dice are easy to procure, common even before rpgs, generally the dominant dice type in war games... A d5 would work as well from the viewpoint of pure game mechanics, for example. Or d10. Of course one might wish to fine-tune some secondary game mechanics if this was messed with. And nowadays the d6 is obviously a matter of tradition, all the various strata of D&amp;D mechanical thinking are calibrated to that d6. The big scary weapon causing d10 damage, the stalwart dwarf with his d12 hit dice, the wimpy wizard with his d4 - they're all calculated off that d6 baseline.<br/><br/>I hope that helps explain how one might arrive at static damage dice constructively; it's not a matter of reducing 3rd edition D&amp;D into simplification, but rather a matter of starting from scratch with the concept of "successful attack" and arriving at the idea of hit points and variable damage from there.<br/><br/>Considering my own specific simulation model, where hit points are not assigned a primary biomechanical interpretation in the fiction, I'll note that I do feature variable damage. It's just that the variation is not tied to specific weapons, which I find an unrealistic and ill-matching conceit for the rules-system for the reasons skimmed over above. Instead, examples of reasons that might cause damage different from the d6 baseline on an attack:<br/>- The attack is made with generally ineffective, sub-lethal means. Unarmed attacks or being unfamiliar with a weapon and thus misusing it are examples of situations where this comes up. For example, I generally have characters cause 1d3 damage or so on unarmed attacks. This is not because a fist is lighter or less sharp than a sword, or any such crass basic physics reason; rather, its' an acknowledgement that a vast martial difference exists between these types of fighting, sufficient to be represented at the level of abstraction the game operates at. There's just no practicable one-hit kill available to a fist-fighter not trained in specific lethal techniques, which is different from the far more lethal weapon-wielding man.<br/>- The fighter is trained in a specific style of fighting that, among other possible effects, bestows a bigger damage die. This is a very "rule of cool" thing in that at the level of abstraction D&amp;D operates almost any such special fighting school goes into the realm of martial arts fiction rather than martial arts fact; think of it as "ninjas are more lethal" logic more than as an attempt to simulate reality. This is sort of my answer to the weapon-based variable damage dice: instead of weapons, why not privilege specific fighting styles in particular situations they are intended for? Seems like a more interesting and flavourful thing to do.<br/>- A particularly successful attack causes extra damage. As we've discussed, I do degrees of success, and in combat those degrees can be used for "stunting". One of the basic stunts is to cause a bit of extra damage. I've traditionally had two degrees (attack result 10 points over AC) equal +1d6 damage for most modes of combat, but a simple +1 damage per degree of success might be more appropriate.<br/><br/>Note also that having static damage dice does not mean that weapons are necessarily identical with each other. There are other ways that weapons can differ from each other, and frequently do to drastic effect. Under this "successful attack" model the issue of effectiveness between a dagger vs. a sword against a man armed with a bill-hook and leather armor is much better addressed by modifiers to the attack roll and AC than by varying the damage roll; a successful attack with the dagger might have the same consequences as that made with a sword, but nothing says that it has to be as easy to accomplish that successful attack with the both of those!<br/><br/>Finally, I should say that my approach to this thing probably only makes sense if you're not hot for weapon fetishes. That is to say, if you think that the traditional D&amp;D structuration that emphasizes weapons as fashion statements is cool, then all of the things I do probably mostly don't make sense. The variable weapon damage thing, and generally hooking game mechanics to specific weapons, makes sense if you think that weapon choice is a "character build" issue: dwarves should use axes, my ranger is cool because he fights with a sabre, this paladin has a special hammer fighting technique, this fighter has a +1 to attack with this specific sword here, and everybody chooses their weapons from a list of 30-40 options. If these types of weapon-focused conceits work for you aesthetically, then variable damage profiles for weapons go well with that, and support it. In fact, my understanding of the matter is that variable weapon damage profiles have been one of the big cornerstones that have contributed to establishing this aesthetic in the D&amp;D fantasy world - and by extension, the world of modern gaming fantasy in general.<br/><br/>For clarity, the reverse of that observation is that <i>for me</i> the emphasis on individual signature weapons in gaming fantasy doesn't do anything - it feels dumb and unrealistic, and it comes in the way of exploring real martial issues. (That's always a big issue for me with the fantasy conventions - I have infinite patience for varieties of dragon-people, but when the fantasy comes in the way of exploring things that are actually real, such as historical swordplay, it becomes a problem for me in D&amp;D.) Thus it's not surprising that I like to shape the rules system in a direction that encourages pondering the "real" reasons for different arms to exist, and the real implications of that martial landscape. Instead of thinking "my character uses a hammer to make him distinctive" the thinking is rather "a sword is a widely available, flexible weapon that my character is culturally familiar with, and that he trains with the most, so that's what he uses, just like everybody else".<br/><br/>I guess it would be fair to say that I find the entire conceit of a weapons list from which you choose your weapons to be moronic, and the "all weapons are mechanically identical" thing is something of a compromise solution in lieu of "use a fucking sword, that and the spear are the only things that might be reasonably expected to be available in this podunk town". The question of why there are different weapons is a somewhat different one from why there is or isn't variable weapon damage, though, so perhaps we'll leave that for another time <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus" title="Ursus_Spelaeus"><img alt="Ursus_Spelaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus">Ursus_Spelaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431685/#Comment_431685" name="Item_283" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T01:53:23+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  1:53AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, sure.

Eero touches on it nicely: in a game where armor class and "hit points" obviously don't have anything to do with physical damage (else why would an elderly thief have more hit points than a young Orc warrior?), and a single "attack" represents a full minute of combat, it's very bizarre to expect a shortsword to be meaningfully different from a broadsword in terms of "damage". After all, we don't even know how many times you hit your enemy, and whether they dodged, parried, or suffered a number of smaller blows.<br/><br/>However, there are a lot of things involved. Historically, D&amp;D originally used d6 for everything, including hit points and weapons. This makes sense: any attack can kill any target, if it hits right. A dagger through the throat is no different from a sword through the throat after all, and the whole concept of "hit points" makes it pretty clear that only the fatal strike is "real".<br/><br/>You could also say that a large, heavy weapon hurts the target more when it hits, but a small, nimble weapon might be less likely to kill but also might allow its user to attack more often or land more (small) blows - over a long combat round, whether a minute or 10 seconds, this evens out.<br/><br/>In some versions of old-school D&amp;D, you had consistent d6 damage for weapons, but then also a chart of "weapons vs. armor" which gave certain weapons bonuses or penalties against certain types of armour. This has a certain logic to it: your dagger is just as likely to kill someone, but if you're fighting someone in plate mail, you're going to have to roll a lot better with your dagger than if you were using a polearm. Although clunky mechanically, from a logical perspective this approach to modeling combat is very coherent; it makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>When they brought in other types of dice, they started changing hit dice for various classes and monsters, so it was natural for weapons to follow. Introducing different die sizes makes weapon choice meaningful and gives a boost to fighters (who are more likely to use the weapons with the high damage dice). I've seen rules where only fighters with high Strength scores receive a bonus damage when using two-handed weapons, for example.<br/><br/>This led to an increase in average damage dealt across the board, which led to monster hit dice being upgraded to d8s, and so on.<br/><br/>Some other complaints D&amp;D players had before variable damage had nothing to do with "realism" and everything to do with real-life decisions. For instance, if every weapon has the same chance of killing a monster, why would you buy an expensive sword when you can just get a bunch of iron spikes or a sharp stick? Variable damage brings these tendencies back into reasonable territory.<br/><br/>Other ways to approach this I've seen in the OSR include:<br/><br/>1. Variable damage by class. Like in Dungeon World, wizards do d4 damage, thieves d6, etc. This kind of thing makes sense and allows your wizard to pick up a sword to defend himself without throwing "game balance" out the window.<br/><br/>2. Considering weapon choice a tactical trifecta: do you maximize defense, offense, or damage? I've seen different ways of handling this, but the goal is to make the three options mechanically balanced, so that one option isn't always better than the others. An example implementation might be: <br/><br/>* Weapon and shield: +1 AC (from the shield)<br/>* Two-handed weapon: damage bonus (+1 to damage, or roll two dice and keep the best)<br/>* Two weapons: +1 to hit<br/><br/>Here's a link to a sample discussion of variable damage (you can see a variety of opinions in the comments): <a href="http://fightingfantasist.blogspot.ca/2010/01/od-weapon-damage.html?zx=18bdb53ea376ef1f" rel="nofollow">OD&amp;D Weapon Damage</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431689/#Comment_431689" name="Item_285" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T02:33:42+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  2:33AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ultimately, the main problem I see in D&amp;D with hit points is that they serve different functions in different situations. With characters, they seem to represent some combination of dramatic "plot immunity", experience/training, and luck. This has to be earned over time: those who survive are proven to be of "hardy" stock, rewarding the player with improved survivability (much like saving throws).<br/><br/>In the case of weapons and monsters, however, hit points and damage seem to correspond quite strongly to physical size and damage. A bigger ballista does more damage than a crossbow; a larger fireball does more damage, and so on. Big creatures have more hit points, and small ones have fewer. (With a few exceptions, we won't find a giant with 4 hit points, nor a tiny rat-sized creature with 54 HP.)<br/><br/>This makes it difficult to create consistent rules around what hit points are and how they actually work: no matter what you come up with, it's likely to feel off or wrong in the other context. For instance, if hit points are your ability to evade blows and be lucky, why does your little Tinkerbell fairy have more trouble avoiding the giant's slow axe-swings than the claws of a housecat? And so on.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431690/#Comment_431690" name="Item_286" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T03:35:41+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  3:35AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2014 3:40AM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What is the reason so many OSR-people have for keeping damage to always/nearly always 1d6? Coming from 3rd Ed as I am, it's requiring some adjustment in my thinking. I get that there is certain verisimilitude to it, in that a dagger can kill someone just as dead as big two-handed sword. Is it just for simplicity?<br/><br/>The conundrum I have in particular is that one of my players has kitted himself out with a heavy crossbow  - we were going off the LotFP equipment lists as a starting point. Now as far as I can tell in LotFP (and I was reading fast to make rulings mid-session so I may have misunderstood) there is no mechanical difference between light and heavy crossbows other than range penalties. Heavy crossbows can fire further more accurately.<br/></blockquote>\nStop right there! The elegant solution to this problem has already been uncovered in your own post - all weapons do 1d6 damage but this heavy crossbow seems like it would do more, right? So you tell your player "Ok, this crossbow does +1 damage," he marks it on his sheet and play continues. The player just does the maths and reports a higher damage rate when it occurs in combat. If the table wants to extend "+1" to all heavy crossbows, sure! I don't see the need to then immediately jump to the conclusion that you then need to consider calculating all modifiers for all weapons in all situations (or whathaveyou) for the purpose of <i>just in case</i>. <br/><br/>Eero's history of the d6 seems on the money to me! <br/><br/>It's really a pro in terms of simplicity too: All monsters have d6 damage and HD are all d8s. Some larger monsters have multiple HD and multiple attacks/round (i.e. 2 or 3d6 damage). This is great for me as a DM managing different creatures. <br/>\n<blockquote><br/>I've always been fond of this kind of rule for D&amp;D-esque game design. However, you have a bit of problem when a series of lucky rolls can have your 1st-level Fighter surviving 12 blows from a frightening monster, with no reduction in future chances of death. I mean, it's not necessarily a *problem*, but it might feel a bit funny that this same dude can go take *another* arrow in the chest with only a 1-in-6 chance of snuffing it.<br/></blockquote>\nI think the superhero thing has been a little overstated here. These are still pretty glass-jawed characters: the Fighter is <i>dead</i> on a roll of a six (this is a single attack roll, not Roll-to-Hit followed by Roll-to-Damage). The character has snuffed it. There's a level of war-game abstraction going on in the combat here - we're not counting individual arrows shot into the Fighter (if the table cares for colour, perhaps a near-miss means some superficial injury is noted), only what his chances are in this particular pressing attack by the opposition. 1-in-6. <br/> If you consider I'm using Wandering Monster tables that can generate 18 homicidal Halflings all about to charge the Fighter on the front line then this idea that just because he can withstand 12 blows with a slim chance of never getting a 6, that doesn't mean I can start being superheoric as a player. It would <i>still</i> be dumb to pick fights. And it would be dumb not to position your fighters on the front line the above method means the fighter always knows he's tougher than the other classes - the idea of the 1HP fighter annoys me slightly, if only for the contradictory feelings it gives me as a player where I both want to play conservatively and also get into fights. Fighters - professional fighters - are tough and their stats should prove it. The "Commoner" class (with a random medieval career) should be officially risen into the ranks of OSR classes (MU, Cleric, Elf, etc) and the Fighter should require a STR score of 14 or more as a specialist class. <br/><br/>Anyway, I liked your ideas! We should go off a swap some notes on some d6-y D&amp;D mechanics. Ideally, I'd love to work out a Warhammer-inspired d6D&amp;D, or at least make all the Stats and Saves work on 6d lines. The other dice still have a place on the table, but I feel the players need to touch d6s more than anything else. It's just me as a DM looking for the easy life. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, the other simplification I want to work on is Hex Dungeons. I'm not sure why, when we enter the dungeon, we move from the wilderness hex (a lovely simplification of the minutiae of travel) to this linguistically complex describing of dungeon-space in real terms. I realise I waste more time at the table talking about the walls than anything else. So, why not a 60' hexmap? So an unencumbered character can move two hexes in 10 minutes. Suddenly Dungeon Space, Time and Movement are visualised and crystal clear. I'm not scared by D&amp;D getting boardgamey (Talisman is an RPG, secretly), are you?<br/><br/>.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431693/#Comment_431693" name="Item_287" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T04:05:50+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  4:05AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(Talisman is an RPG, secretly)</blockquote>\nYou should hunt down <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34119/tales-of-the-arabian-nights" rel="nofollow">Tales of the Arabian Nights</a>.  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Isn't this getting back to wargames, where it all started?

To me the latter seems like an ugly hack - if you can't handle the fact that 1st level is low, then perhaps a linear progression starting from zero (a cornerstone assumption of D&amp;D) is not your speed to begin with. I would rather start from 3rd level than remove the 1HD, 2HD, 3HD... progression.<br/><br/>For example, I personally think that 1st level fragility is fine (I actively want those low hit points, it's not just that I tolerate them), but that having characters just die at 0 is dumb, so what I do is that I mess with the boundary event: when you hit zero instead of dying you make various rolls that determine whether you're out of the fight, whether you're permanently injured, and whether you're immediately dead. The difficulty of these checks depends on the mode of assault, so e.g. fist-fighting is less likely to knock you out even if you're already at zero HP. This way I can have the best of both worlds: on the one hand I have this elegant system with fragile 1st level characters, but on the other hand they can have a <i>little</i> bit of extra staying power: some characters survive being brought to zero, and on occasion some even manage to fight on until they take one more hit. Makes characters ideally robust in my experience: they're like '80s action movie ensemble types, who might go down at a swipe, but might also hang on for a few exchanges on a good day.<br/><br/>If I wanted characters to be less mechanically fragile, so that they simply can't be taken out by incidental friction most of the time, I well might enjoy the vitality/hp system. It's elegant, has all sorts of mechanical possibilities, and makes clean distinction between real injury and dramatic injury. Despite the differentiation, it still essentially means that all characters have an extra 10 points or so on their HP gauges, even if those last ten points are something you'd really rather not draw on if you can avoid it.<br/><br/>Needless to say that I am not at all in favour of the LotFP way, which is to roll hp at 1st level normally, but then replace any below-average roll with the average of the die, rounded up - and with Fighters, it's actually replaced with the maximum result of the die, so they always start at 8 HP. Not only is this chicken-shit, it's also inelegant <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Also, if you have issues with the random variation of hit points, I suggest getting rid of permanent HPs. Once you reroll them for every adventure you can just treat the daily variation as normal part of the human condition: some days the ronin just wakes up with the discrete feeling that today would be a good day to die. Over the long term all 1st level characters are in the same boat, though.<br/><br/>I am admittedly beyond hardcore on this matter. I entertain myself thinking up ways to make the D&amp;D support even more meaningless lethality. I find that the constant, nihilistic existential pressure focuses minds wonderfully, and makes the occasional streak of success taste all the more sweet. I simply don't have any interest for facilitating the survival of <i>this</i> particular character any further than his choices, talents and luck take him.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431708/#Comment_431708" name="Item_292" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T15:48:25+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  3:48PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Other ways to approach this I've seen in the OSR include:<br/><br/>1.

Our fighters get Arneson's "Chop til you Drop" ability to keep attacking when they kill, but instead of a +1 damage at various levels as he suggested along with it they get to roll bigger and bigger dice. It's nice. I also let improvised weapons or weapons used to subdue do one die smaller and unarmed attacks deal two dice smaller\u2014so an unarmed mid-level fighter is as deadly as most folk. This feels fairly elegant.<br/><br/>Then when people ask me about weapon choices I offer a different version of those three choices. Most people don't take this up to serious though. But two-handed weapons are for fighting the heavily armoured or striking without getting close, so get +1 to hit. If a character dual wields I let them switch techniques round to round, with slightly inferior results: +1 ac but not against missiles or +1 "to-hit" but not against shields.<br/><br/>These rules mostly developed through people asking me a question and us coming up with something on the spot that got canonized after coming up repeatedly.<br/><br/>And the third thing is that weapons are different fictionally. Obviously spears are really strong. I've just ditched initiative for the first round of combat in favour of weapon length. And players love to do other things with their equipment, after all.<br/><br/>But mostly they end up using whatever magic weapons they can get their hands on by the time they are level four or five anyway rather than choosing their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431709/#Comment_431709" name="Item_293" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T16:12:39+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  4:12PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (As a total aside: I'm with you on the lethality thing, Eero.

What led to this starting up? Was it sparked by an interest in the OSR, or something else (perhaps your involvement with LotFP, and/or publishing modules)?</blockquote>\nIt was around Christmas of 2007 or so, I think, when my friend Sami was visiting with us in Upper Savo. Sami, Sipi, myself and a few local teenagers were hanging out and playing games. D&amp;D came up, and as is often the case, Sami said some ignorant stuff about it. I challenged him to play, so we broke off the boardgame night we were having and moved to a local kebab restaurant for a D&amp;D one-shot session.<br/><br/>This was the first time I'd played D&amp;D since our Bextropolis campaign in Helsinki broke off, so it'd been a while, and a lot had happened since - I'd played a few hundred sessions of Forgean drama games, for one. The session had a surprisingly clear chemistry, and I found that unlike before, I had a rather clear theoretical understanding for what I was doing as a GM. A lot of things contributed to that - playing T&amp;T, reading theory, playing a lot of Forge games, maturing as a human being, etc.<br/><br/>You can read about the details at my blog, I documented this at the time. That "Challengeful adventure gaming" post that I like to link to people for a short overview of my D&amp;D theory is from that time.<br/><br/>After that session I grew more actively interested in returning to adventure games; I ran an on and off campaign called "Alder Gate" for local teenagers in midsts of more serious story gaming, and then in 2010 started the weekly campaign that blew the lid off the exercise in terms of quality and creative interest. Played like monkeys. In fact, still do.<br/><br/>I hope that answers the question. Consciously reading up on OSR came about in consequence of my renewed interest; meeting up with Raggi and getting involved with his Grand Experiment was more of a function of my culture activism - I like to get to know people new to publishing, and see if they need any help or such. The fact that there are certain creative harmonies between my current interests and Jim's is a happy coincidence.\n<blockquote>* Why did you decide to play D&amp;D instead of, say, Tunnels&amp;Trolls?</blockquote>\nAccidental. I could imagine how instead of a Grand D&amp;D campaign I could've started a Grand T&amp;T campaign sometime in 2007-10. I've got a few notes on that in the desk drawer, although not as developed and play-honed as my D&amp;D stuff. Had I done it, my campaign would've been set in a relatively high fantasy take on 12th century Finland. Fighting with giant magical pikes, waging war on the enroaching Goblin Land, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Difficult to remember what exactly might have tipped in favour of D&amp;D at the time... I was running the occasional T&amp;T one-shots for people, showing off the interesting bits of the game while demonstrating what Gamist play (and old school techniques) actually mean. I have a vague impression that it had probably to do with the specific mechanics of the respective games; I was just then figuring out my currently preferred "readings" for various cornerstone D&amp;D mechanics (hit points, armor class, attack boni, etc.), and putting all these ideas floating around all into one campaign had appeal. In the meantime the T&amp;T thing would've required some real work to revise &amp; streamline - to get to where I'm at with D&amp;D, essentially. Could well be that I chose D&amp;D simply because my D&amp;D was more ready than my T&amp;T for the prime time when the social environment called for a hero to entertain the local youths with fantasy adventure gaming.<br/><br/>I'm currently apparently still finding D&amp;D inspiring, but I might move on to T&amp;T or Warhammer at some point if I get bored with hit points and armor class. We'll see.\n<blockquote>* Did you borrow or import any aspects of Tunnels&amp;Trolls for your own D&amp;D game? Which ones, and why?</blockquote>\nNot directly, no. Bricolage (putting existing things together) is not really my primary style, so melding the two together never really occurred to me. Rather, my design work's usually all about first principles: given that D&amp;D has a linear hit point scheme with too few hit points at low levels and too many at high levels (to pick an example recently discussed), what does this mean, and how can I make it work so it's not "too few" or "too many", but rather something rich and unique and desirable? That's the sort of conundrum I tend to work on when figuring out D&amp;D stuff - make it be more of what it is, rather than make it be what I want it to be.<br/><br/>Bringing in ideas from the outside just because they're cool does nothing for me. For example, when the <i>Purple Worm Graveyard</i> had those Apocalypse World tables for resolving certain corner cases specific to the adventure, my reaction was not "cool, I like that AW mechanic"; rather, it was "interesting, it is true that D&amp;D has a strand of 2d6 rolls running through it in limited applications". So I reflect solutions readily against the tradition, as well as against my own mechanical aesthetics. Not much room for Tunnels &amp; Trolls to get a foot in, in a process like that.\n<blockquote>If you have any thoughts on how D&amp;D and T&amp;T might be complementary or opposed to each other in principle or agenda, I'd love to hear about that. Are they near-cousins, or different species?</blockquote>\nThey're the same game from my viewpoint. (That totally should not be read as anything else than my having an esoteric understanding of the concept of "game".) Or rather, they have an identical creative agenda and identical methodology, so the only thing they differ in is in mechanical solutions and some procedures. T&amp;T is further away from the D&amp;D core than old editions due to not honoring the technical cornerstones (HP, AC, Saves, individual combat actions, relatively static abilities, etc.), but that just makes it one more step removed rather than an entirely different game.<br/><br/>It would be easy to mix the two in various ways. For example, a natural thing to do would be to implement the T&amp;T combat system as an alternate resolution mode in D&amp;D, one that you could swap in when the nature of the situation makes it preferable to the round-robin D&amp;D system. One could also use the D&amp;D xp protocols in T&amp;T, or vice versa, with no difficulty. Really, there aren't any ideas in the two games that couldn't be fruitfully integrated in the other, given a bit of thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431718/#Comment_431718" name="Item_296" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T21:53:50+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  9:53PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent answers, thank you, Eero!<br/><br/>Makes me wonder how many people have played old-school D&amp;D (and possibly rediscovered it) entirely on a dare!<br/><br/>Do you remember what your own expectations and/or assumptions going into that first session were?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431721/#Comment_431721" name="Item_297" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T22:18:18+00:00" title="April 27, 2014 10:18PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Do you remember what your own expectations and/or assumptions going into that first session were?</blockquote>\nI was confident - I'd been musing on the matter previously, and had prior experience from my Helsinki campaign to fall back on, so it wasn't like I was playing D&amp;D for the first time. I'd also been playing T&amp;T occasionally over the last few years, so I knew what I wanted to accomplish that night in technical terms. I was playing with good friends and high-quality gamers, so I didn't really have any expectations or worries - we'd just see what would come of it. Also, because the session was planned and executed during the same night, I didn't really have any time to develop any doubts or expectations.<br/><br/>I was pretty hot on immediate expression then - this can be seen in <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, it's all about elevating immediacy over such standby values as reliability or quality - so doing a D&amp;D session without books or prep ("primitive" style, as I characterized it) was a natural move to make. In hindsight the session ("Fury of Nifur", you can find a detailed writeup in the blog) had the characteristic marks of "storygamer D&amp;D", same as e.g. Jason Morningstar's and Ben Lehman's scenarios have - Mike's seahex stuff has some similarities, too. Not surprising, considering how similar our gaming experiences through the few preceding years had been.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431727/#Comment_431727" name="Item_298" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T01:10:16+00:00" title="April 28, 2014  1:10AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Fighters - professional fighters - are tough and their stats should prove it.

I believe the later editions of the game are all about d20s... who knows? ;D But, yes, I'm sure there is an appeal - at least for the sake of elegance and grace. I'm conflicted of course: I just love the physicality of the dice. Any game that lets me roll a different die for each weapon or skill has my nod. I'm keen to break out Warhammer Fantasy RP First edition, mixes a central percentile system with the D&amp;D-dice in support. <br/><br/>An interesting alternative to the HP/HD conversation thus far is to change how Leveling works. What if 2nd Level is only 80xp or something and 3rd is 200, 4th 400, 5th 800, etc? If we loosen our hoarder's grip on Levels-as-Reward and let them rack up quickly (and drop again? Loose half your levels to recover a mortal wound?) perhaps we can more readily assess the nature of Low Level vs. High Level play. I simply don't have enough Data about character growth, simply because so few people have grown characters beyond 3rd level. Even OSR vets! \n<blockquote><br/>However, I'm not sure how it would be best handled: is the idea that you rolled bad stats, so you're punished by a "bad" character class, or would the "Commoner" have some other benefits to balance the lack of fighting ability/magic ability/whatever else?<br/><br/>How would the Commoner work in play?

No specialist Prime Requisites that could mean they start play as any other class. You could have the highest CON or CHA in the party and still only qualify as a commoner. Commoners have access to a "Career" table plus Trade Goods. <i>Dungeon Crawl Classics</i> has this table for Lv.0 PCs that could probably be leveraged into D&amp;D here.

The base classes were intentionally flexible and vague, while the prestige classes were socially and culturally specific. I don't know if you'd count that game as being "freeform" regarding classes, but to us it feels class-based.<br/><br/>In LotFP we've stuck pretty close to the standard classes, excepting the addition of the "Servant", which I've felt necessary within the context of randomly rolled abilities and the entire campaign structure.<br/><br/>My thinking on the matter tends to be relatively flexible - not too many classes, base the classes logically on the setting, allow characters to have realistic flexibility in their development.

I'm curious because you have all at once a bit of an aversion to specific "character builds", preferring more organic character development, but also, as far as I can tell, love developing unique "crunch" for your games.

The progression of abilities is relatively minor and slow (except for spell-casting, I suppose), while hit points increase very very dramatically. So, going from level 1 to level 2 or 3 dramatically changes the nature of the game because of survivability, but otherwise isn't a huge change (except that the characters accrue fictional positioning, equipment, and magical items, and the players tend to improve their skills, so the game transforms that way).<br/><br/>In my own "house D&amp;D" which I'm gradually collecting stuff for, I'm going to have a slower HP progression, which in turn allows more gradual and rapid "advancement". I like the implications of that, personally. <br/><br/>Gambling with levels as being more fluid in play sounds interesting, but perhaps hard to implement under D&amp;D rules "as written"! <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3259#comic" rel="nofollow">Worth exploring</a>. <br/><br/>I love the idea of the Commoner class, but I'm not sold on it mechanically just yet. Let's keep brainstorming this one. So far Eero's "Servant" class seems like the best pitch for this kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431757/#Comment_431757" name="Item_302" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T11:56:20+00:00" title="April 28, 2014 11:56AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2014 12:08PM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Commoner, Servant... <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKX8g76Rkqg" rel="nofollow">Dogsbody</a>?</i><br/><br/>I'm not particularly a D&amp;D purist.

So it's hard to imagine what you might have done with your Deudeu "prestige classes".</blockquote>\nThey were mostly driven by D&amp;D tradition, and by character speciation, and by needs of crunch. For example, having a paladin, ranger, bard or assassin prestige class makes sense in the context of reflecting ideas from AD&amp;D and the history of D&amp;D in general. Then again, a specific high-level character (comparatively speaking) might naturally suggest with their positioning choices the existence of a specific character class that falls outside the scope of existing options. Finally, some crunch ideas would only work as separate classes due to the mechanical basic assumptions of the campaign.<br/><br/>An example of that last point is the "Duelist" class that saw some play. The campaign had a conceit wherein basic attack bonus from the Fighter class could not rise above +5 due to simple increase in competence; this was basically a realism-based scope thing, sort of saying that +5 is as far as mere skill and experience in swordplay can take you. (Attack bonus in this rules system is not an arbitrary number; we can directly calculate how much carnage each point translates to, when applied against e.g. an ordinary infantry troop. At some point you cross into the realm of the supernatural.) Such a limitation would apply to each separate type of attack bonus separately, where a class like the "Duelist" would come in - as a fighter specializing in elaborate tournament ground fighting the Duelist gets a +1 per level attack bonus against individual opponents (which one could do in the middle of a general melee, but doing so would imply leaving yourself open to particularly harsh flanking attacks or stumbling; the fighting style of the duelist presumes both reasonably even ground for fine footwork, and an individual opponent they can focus on exclusively). Due to being of different type from the Fighter's attack bonus, the Duelist's bonus could be piled on top of the Fighter's bonus - understandably this attack bonus -based pressure drove innovation in fighter specialist classes when characters got a few levels.<br/><br/>(To be specific, that Duelist attack bonus is capable of being turned off - we used to talk of a "duelist stance". So you could choose combat round to combat round whether the situation was appropriate for the quick footwork and dainty special weapon grips and whatnot that differentiates the duelist's fighting style. If not, then he's just a presumably well-conditioned 0th level Fighter with potentially some pretty nasty special moves until the general melee subsides enough for him to start going all finesse on the opposition. Obviously enough the player of a Duelist would want to e.g. challenge the opposition warleader to a duel, or have friends cover his back as he launches himself at the enemy champion, or whatever.)<br/><br/>The point of running a Duelist could be color (it's a recognized profession in the imperial lands of fantasy Europe, where judicial duels are still used in certain types of legal situations; also, sports-type boxers and such might be classed Duelists), exploration of cool special crunch (the duelist pretty much has access to all the specialized kungfu wankery that Fighters can only get at high levels, if then - except obviously colored with western swordplay terminology rather than the traditional Orientalism), or piling some extra attack bonuses on top after maxing out the Fighter class (that level bonus to attack would be cumulative with the Fighter's more general bonus). The Duelist's basic class feature is clearly weaker than what a generic Fighter gets (the Fighter's attack bonus is good for duels as well as other types of combat, whether ranged or melee or horseback or whatever), so their xp exponent is slightly less - 1800, if I remember correctly. An equal-level Duelist might be presumed to win a <i>duel</i> against a Fighter, appropriately enough, while being less flexible in many sorts of adventuring situations.<br/><br/>As a prestige class you couldn't declare your character a Duelist to begin with except with a roll of 1/6 at chargen, so it's necessarily a rare type of character. A nice change of pace, though, and I enjoyed how it's sort of an alternative to the traditional D&amp;D monk - same sorts of fanciful special moves, but instead of being more elite, it's sort of less elite in feel than the war-tested Fighter - a poor man's Fighter, sort of. Also, the way multiclassing works in this particular campaign framework makes becoming a Duelist at 6th level sort of sensible - characters who get to 5th level have the option of adding a "secondary" class, and for a Fighter speciation is pretty much the only way to continue min-maxing that all-important attack bonus <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Aside from the Duelist, other specialist classes that have come up at least in passing are magical specialists (illusionist, theurges, necromancers at least), other fighting specialists (paladins, rangers, monks, barbarians), various AD&amp;D ideas (thieves, bards, assassins, druids), demihumans... as the basic classes are intentionally very generic (even more so than Basic D&amp;D), there's plenty of room for lobbing off conceptual space for other classes. Of course this requires not having nerdy aneurysms at the thought of e.g. four holy warriors one of whom is build off a Fighter chassis, one out of a Hermit, and two out of Paladins and Monks. For me that sort of class overlap is not a contradiction or flaw in the scheme, so all's good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431877/#Comment_431877" name="Item_304" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T06:52:49+00:00" title="April 30, 2014  6:52AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, do you have experience with Clinton's <i>Donjon</i>?

I could be wrong, of course! But Donjon, being a D&amp;D parody (I think you're quite right there!) allows one to easily play with all those elements in a very colourful way, so it seems like you might enjoy that aspect.<br/><br/>I'm also not as enamoured with DW as the  average S-G gal or fellow. In fact, while I recognize that it's a good game, it's something I've given quite a bit of thought, and it's probably my *least* favourite AW hack out there. Here are some points which may or may not apply:<br/><br/>1. A huge aspect is the Colour. I feel like DW removes all the flavour from D&amp;D, leaving just the bare bones of recognizable D&amp;D-isms, with no flesh on them. All the classes and races feel like totally generic versions of what they're supposed to be. If you make a DW Elven Wizard by-the-book, I can say, "He's pretty much your generic Elven D&amp;D Wizard, yeah?" And you'd have a hard time disagreeing with that.<br/><br/>At least in Moldvay D&amp;D you run up against weird details like that character having bizarre stats (a Wizard with a Charisma of 5 and a Strength of 16 is quite possible, and suggests a lot about the character) or having a lot/not much starting cash, and that shaping the character somehow, and so forth. I feel like our characters in the Grey Sands game have been MORE colourful and interesting and unique than what I would expect to see in DW.<br/><br/>I had the same issue with Red Box Hack (fantastic unique colour!) and Old School Hack, which removed much of that with more generic stuff. In Red Box Hack, you're a Snakeman, and you can create a homunculus of yourself and see into the astral plane. In Old School Hack, you're a Magic-User and you have an ability which allows you to attack with a damage bonus when someone is in an open arena. (Although I don't find it as bad as DW in this respect.)<br/><br/>Instead of fictional creativity, it seems you get moves which are all about being different or more effective in combat. Which leads me to...<br/><br/>2. This goes for a lot of the moves and the structure of the game: most character moves are things which increase your damage or your armor or your hit points... fairly few drastically change who your character *is*, as moves often do in AW or Monsterhearts - in those games, often taking a new move means your character has suddenly transformed into something entirely unexpected. All of a sudden you're a masochist or deeply in love or part of your brain is being eaten by the psychic maelstrom, or maybe you have a bunch of barbaric drug addicts who consider you to be a prophet following you around.<br/><br/>3. If what draws you to D&amp;D is the deadly and/or gamist aspect of play, challenging your wits and seeing how long you can survive against long odds, the basic AW engine seems to be at odds with that. I know some people disagree with me (we've had a long discussion about this here before), but I still feel this way. And DW's structure suggests long-term development and fairly low odds if losing or dying: those looking for hardcore challenge and a rough, deadly game where a single mistake will doom the whole party are going to have to work a lot harder for it than... say, us in Grey Sands.<br/><br/>Mike, I'll be curious to hear if any of these resonate with you, or if you reasons are altogether different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431944/#Comment_431944" name="Item_308" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T13:29:24+00:00" title="May  1, 2014  1:29PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I'm curious about the development of your D&amp;D-experience.

If so, how so? And has it drifted closer to D&amp;D-as-written, remained the same, or diverged further?

All D&amp;D (including just about anything involving dungeons and dragons) is at heart, if viewed in the cruelest light, a satire of European medievalism by Men From The Future. This isn't the real experience of playing D&amp;D, I appreciate, we're not laughing at the past - but there's always a comedic, self-deprecating side to the game.

The basic abilities are called things like Virility, Adroitness, and Wherewithal, while other suggested abilities include things like "Be Worshipped" and "Look Like Slime". <br/><br/>However, Clinton recommends discussing the seriousness level before playing:\n<blockquote>Dial: Seriousness level<br/><br/>An important thing for the group to determine before play is the seriousness level of the game. Donjon is a very different sort of game in that the players have the ability to create as much of the outcome as the GM.<br/><br/>Playing a game with high humor can be rewarding, but can also be grating if attempted with the wrong players. Likewise, some players may not enjoy the visceral horror of a grim rust-and-blood sort of game.<br/><br/>This dial must be set before the game begins, and has the settings of: Monty Python and the Geeks (over-the-top), Slapstick (lots of funny), Tongue-in-Cheek (full of allusions to role-playing cliches taken deadly seriously by the characters), Black Humor, Serious, and Rust-and-Blood (fantasy horror). This dial should be set by agreement between the GM and players.</blockquote>\nHowever, from a different point of view, I'm not sure that playing Donjon as a "Serious" game does not constitute parody of D&amp;D.

I did something like the following on the fly; now I\u2019m formalizing it a bit so that I can see what others think, and so that others can draw ideas from it.<br/><br/>This ruling fits into a very Eero-inspired version of D&amp;D - I\u2019m unashamedly taking lots of things he has said that seemed like excellent ideas to me, although we\u2019re also diverging from those as seems appropriate to us. This means that what \u201cserious injury\u201d mostly means here is when someone would have died but the system has replaced it with what Eero calls a critical hit. It\u2019s also a bit Apocalypse World, as I like the idea of surgery being about hard choices.<br/><br/>When you try and use surgery to patch someone with a serious injury roll d20 plus applicable modifiers. For every 5 points, take 1 of the following:\n<ol><li>In the short term, they are less debilitated by pain and injury</li>\n<li>There is less risk of serious infection (both from the original injury and from surgery)</li>\n<li>There is less risk of them dieing in surgery</li>\n<li>The flow of blood is completely staunched (if applicable)</li>\n<li>You are able to save the limb (if applicable)</li>\n<li>With 3d6 weeks of rest, they make a partial recovery</li></ol>Surgery takes d4 turns (10 - 40 minutes).<br/><br/>My thoughts on these:\n<ol><li>\u201cLess debilitated\u201d - I\u2019m assuming that taking a critical hit like this probably knocks you out of the action for the rest of the dungeon. Perhaps they are able to give some advice through gritted teeth. Whereas if the doctor takes this option, they are up and about, albeit in lots of pain and moving shakily. (Lots of penalties to things).</li>\n<li>I\u2019m assuming some kind of 1 in 20 for infection instead of 1 in 6. Normal disease rules.</li>\n<li>Again, something like the infection. I like this because it means that if instead of just trying to bandage someone up and leave them to heal badly you really try and fix them, this introduces a new chance of things going wrong.</li>\n<li>Tactical concerns here to do with things that follow blood trails\u2026</li>\n<li>Limbs. They are useful (I have nothing to say here).</li>\n<li>What I\u2019m thinking here is that lots of critical hits result in halved attributes, under the Eero-inspired rules. So if you take a big injury then your Dexterity may drop from 12 to 6. If the surgeon choose this option, then that stat jumps back up by, say, +2, after the period of rest. Also, maybe they lose the critical hit mark on their sheet, so they can take another one without dieing? Not sure about that.</li></ol>\nThoughts? Comments? Obviously this makes injuries a more complex mechanical event, rather than a quick thing. My approach on this has been to focus rules on stuff that people take perks in - allow the players to spend the time on things they want to. If people are not interested in this stuff, they will create characters who are not so focused on surgery in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432124/#Comment_432124" name="Item_317" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-05T11:50:26+00:00" title="May  5, 2014 11:50AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All that seems good to me. I wouldn't allow a skill check to remove a critical mark (a death cross) myself, but that's largely a matter of how one views their strategic role. Specifically, my goal for high-level play is that characters naturally accumulate these marks, which are nigh-impossible to remove, and thus a high-level character won't necessarily have a huge margin in this matter; they might be able to carry eight crosses without perishing, but if they already have four from earlier adventures, they're not necessarily that much better off than a less experienced character.<br/><br/>(For comparison's sake, consider the AD&amp;D rule about resurrections, and how a character can only be resurrected a maximum of times equal to their Con score. The "cross count" is sort of similar number in strategic terms, in that it's a long-term health thing that is almost impossible to affect. A character might e.g. take a swim in a powerful healing magic pool to remove one cross, or take a break of 1d6 years from adventuring - that's the scale of effort I prefer for characters to take, should they desire to remove crosses.)<br/><br/>Regarding the seriousness of the injuries, what you're representing here (excessive blood-loss, long recuperation period, field surgery) is typical in my game of injuries that result from failed saves on critical hits; on successful saves we see slightly less serious injuries, that are nevertheless tactically debilitating. So we sort of have three types of injury: mere hit point loss represents loss of stamina and fighting spirit, succeeding in a save vs. injury results in lesser wounds, and failure results in a cross plus effects similar to what your table here indicates. I mention this in case you want to make similar lists of concerns for those "lesser injuries", too. Stuff like -2s to attacks made with an injured arm, or whatever.<br/><br/>Procedurally I think that your list approach is very good, and I also very much like the principle you mention at the end: there is a simple baseline rule that is only complicated through player choice to focus on that matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432125/#Comment_432125" name="Item_318" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-05T12:15:52+00:00" title="May  5, 2014 12:15PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>All that seems good to me.

We will presumably also have ways for a healer to mitigate the effects of lesser injuries from succeeded saves.

The GM disclaims decision-making and leaves a lot of decisions to the dice: like, for example, which character a monster with no clear preference might decide to attack. This allows us to construct a really neat set of procedures for a GM to follow, and to create a certain play culture. This is all a really cool effect, especially on a longer or larger scale, as we've discussed previously.<br/><br/>However, it occurs to me that leaving a lot of decisions to the dice increases the random factor in the game. Let's consider, on one hand, a hypothetical game where the number of encounters, and the threat level of each encounter, is carefully crafted to match the capabilities of the adventuring party. (I've heard of such a D&amp;D... but never played it.) On the other hand, we have a game where a random encounter can include anything from a miraculous find of a great treasure to a surprise attack from an all-powerful demon from hell. That's a significant range!<br/><br/>In the same vein, reaction rolls and morale checks and similar essentially 50/50 decisions can have HUGE ramifications on a character's survival. They're all low on hit points, when the monster which could wipe the party misses a morale check and flees. They meet the most dangerous monster in the game, and the reaction roll says it's friendly. Phew! The GM wonders if the sketchy NPC might choose this particular moment to betray the PCs and leave them stranded... and rolls low. Stuff like that.<br/><br/>How do you think this interacts with the stated goal of challenging the players' wits and strategic and tactical decisions? Is there a danger to this kind of process creating so much randomness that it overwhelms the value of strategy in the game? <br/><br/>(I'm imagining a sea adventure, where a small boat sails for many days and then hits a random encounter, which comes up with the result of a whale or similar large sea creature. A reaction roll is made, and the creature is determined to be actively hostile. Then a surprise roll is made, and the PCs are surprised. Finally, the GM decides there's a X in Y chance that the creature will just try to crush the boat with a blow of its tail. This effort succeeds, and all the PCs are in the water, a long way from land. What are the odds that sharks find them? We roll, and they do. How cold is the water? We roll, and it turns out it's so cold they won't survive more than five minutes. And so on: now they are all dead, no matter how carefully-planned and executed the expedition was originally. I hope that illustrates my question!)<br/><br/>(In retrospect, the careful limitations of the typical dungeon environment put some upper and lower bounds on this, compared to wide-open "world exploration" D&amp;D. That's interesting, too. Factors like dungeon level and monster level also build in certain limitations, if you use those in your game. Anyway, that's neither here nor there.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432324/#Comment_432324" name="Item_320" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-09T00:12:12+00:00" title="May  9, 2014 12:12AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I may attempt to answer:<br/><br/>First of all D&amp;D has a stated goal of strategic and tactical decisions, yes, but it also has a goal of gambling and pushing your luck. It's not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information" rel="nofollow">perfect information</a> game. Would it be better to leave the dungeon now with the loot you have and brave an extra journey overland and back? Or should you push just a bit further? The players can debate what they know, but ultimately there's a lot unknown and random, and part of the thrill of D&amp;D is taking those kinds of risks and seeing them have real consequences.<br/><br/>So say then that the point is not to have randomness overwhelm the strategy, nor the strategy overwhelm the gambling.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think this comes back to good design of your situation, whether that be at the level of the campaign world, dungeon, or room, and how well you communicate it. If the ocean has marauding whales and sharks then setting sail in it is a very dangerous prospect as you have outlined. So long as the players have some knowledge, though, about the world around them, they can make sensible strategic risks. Even if they can't ask questions about, for example, incidence of whale attacks, they may be able to find out: does anyone else sail this sea? Regularly? Or is it an activity considered fraught and deadly?<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, it's true that even with good situation design and communication, the dice can fall unpredictably. Maybe there's a a 1% chance of whale attack, and so the PCs hear it's pretty safe and go for it, but get unlucky. I think that's desirable though - the risks are always real, the decisions really count. All the players can do is minimize risk of defeat and increase risk of victory and then roll the dice.<br/><br/>(Aside: Is this man-eating whale cousin to the one Eero was playing during the first voyage of the Silent Dusk?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432325/#Comment_432325" name="Item_321" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-09T00:15:19+00:00" title="May  9, 2014 12:15AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2014 12:17AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: Martin says it all more succinctly above.\n<blockquote>It occurs to me, particularly after running another session on IRC today, that there are some interesting side-effects to a "hygienic" approach based on aleatoric processes.

The second is that "randomness" is not the same thing as flat and unpredictable random distribution - not unless you've renounced that decision-making. I think that characterizing hygiene as abrogation of decision-making responsibility is a caricature of the actual ideal state; it is not a question of flipping a coin stupidly in every situation, but rather about making decisions with the correct unbiased mindset.<br/><br/>If the GM truly did nothing except regurgitated stupid random results, then you could indeed encounter a dead deer as easily as a great and powerful demon. After all, making the constructive and intelligent setting-creation decision that demons are almost never encountered just wandering about randomly (they are rare, that is) would be making a choice about it, so the hypothetical "randomness only" GM would certainly never presume. Instead, they'd give each ludicrous impossibility the exact same chance so as to not be biased. In fact, their random encounter table would fairly only ever have once-in-a-lifetime impossibilities, because there are so many different ways to be impossible than there are to be ordinary.<br/><br/>Hygienic decision-making uses randomness as a tool for getting through moments where bias would otherwise be more difficult to avoid; these are situations where the GM does not have a compelling causal deduction available from known information regarding the setting. This is not the same thing as "the entire monster manual is in my random encounter table". Most of the time the GM works with his own understanding of the setting, with his own aesthetic vision about it, and so on. This is the reason for why the wilds are habitable in a reasonable setting: the GM is perhaps letting the PCs encounter a bit more exotic and adventurous things than the boring non-protagonist whose actions we are not observing in hopes of adventure, but they're still acknowledging that verisimilitude prevents them from having a demon in every bush (unless the setting really is like that: if it is, presumably the NPCs never leave town, either).<br/><br/>What this means for your question about player skill is that the players can use skill, because they can make those deductions about the setting as well. D&amp;D is essentially a blinded deduction and risk management exercise where the GM has all the puzzle pieces to deduce from, and the players don't. This doesn't mean that the GM is always ahead in reasoning, but he often is, particularly when the GM can hear and judge the reasoning of the players. (This latter is a good thing, not a weakness: if the GM is ignoring some aspect of a situation, but hears the players reason about it, then he knows to improve his own reasoning, creating a dialogue. After all, the principle of realism is not that the GM is somehow magically always perfectly correct a priori; it is merely that we strive to be correct, and ultimately achieve the best choices our collective wisdom and skill makes possible.)<br/><br/>As for the scenario where an adventuring party plans a sea voyage according to all of the acknowledged best practices of the setting and its naval technology, and their ship sinks anyway: I fully realize that this would be much too much for many people as a scenario, and they would "fix" it to make it so the players would be rewarded for their correct choices. For me such would be anathema, because I believe that even correct choices should not always work in D&amp;D, the ultimate game of risk management. ("Risk management" does not mean avoiding all negative consequences ever, by the way - it means accepting a certain degree of risk as being worth it for the stakes at hand.) In the real world, and in true to life scenarios, even the best choices will occasionally fail due to reasons outside your own control. If you truly do not ever want to sink with your ship, then do not leave port in the first place. That is truly, genuinely the only way, and few PC parties have magic that ensures that they could only ever sink at sea due to their own mistakes instead of bad luck. The very choice of taking a trip by sea has an inherent risk to it, with no way around it for most.<br/><br/>(The naval example is actually a very good illustration of the issue of "should PCs be able to fail even if they've made no mistake", because sailing is historically a human endeavour that has a major natural attrition factor: ships have sunk through human history despite the highest professionalism due to reasons outside human control. This is literally why "acts of god" clauses were developed by insurance companies, because several percent of the ships still sunk in the age of sail due to storms and whatever despite all imaginable human effort. The only way to avoid that is to not sail.)<br/><br/>Of course I am not in favour of the idea that it's a good idea to make all of the events in your campaign acts of god because some element of that is a realistic strategic consideration; I'm sure that's the next question, but you'll just have to get used to discovering the golden mean <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Specifically, there is such a thing as coordination of gameability, or "discovering challenge" as I like to put it; this process is seen in the fact that PCs are far more likely than would be statistically probable to stumble upon exciting adventures. A GM who justifies an ungameable setting set-up with realism has forsaken the <i>actual</i> goal of GMing.<br/><br/>Perhaps this helps think about the GM's responsibilities: when the players declare that they want to take a trip by sea, the GM's job is to figure out the real challenges and risks involved in that. If something truly brilliant occurs to him, something the group would love to deal with as content of play, he will hook that - negotiate about it with the players, or on occasion simply decide that this content is on the likely route their ship will take, for good or ill. (And no, I would never negotiate about whether you'd like to have a storm, in the abstract. That's necessarily something that PCs will do their utmost to avoid if they can. The best I could do would be to have a magical ever-present storm surrounding an adventure location, so they'd have a reason to sail straight in there and I could have my cool storm encounter.) All the possibilities and concerns that are not specifically chosen for might or might not emerge through random friction processes, but the point is that the session of play will have a "beef" to it because the GM makes conscious choices about seeing and recognizing challenges.<br/><br/>The GM should not be an idiot dice-bot; rather, he should be a curious scientist, intrigued about seeing what this particular party of primates might do when faced with the prospect of sailing the Gullet of Winds in a ship loaded with turtle soup. This attitude involves a mixture of unbiased decision-making, aesthetic inspiration (somebody had to invent that Gullet of Winds in the first place) and randomness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432327/#Comment_432327" name="Item_322" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-09T02:20:55+00:00" title="May  9, 2014  2:20AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for this back-and-forth, guys. Interesting to hear and improve my understanding. Having spectated your game last night, Paul, I would say there are certainly places where you could compute with dice less and drive a little of your vision of the unfolding scene into the game. Dice are randomisers to inform blossoming fiction, as soon as they give you a thread you can follow that to the most reasonable/justifiable place. But that's my two cents. <br/><br/>In regards to the Whale situation, I think I would kill the PCs right then and there, inform them of the bizarre set of circumstances that let to this Bizarre First Turn TPK then make the players some kind of offer where, seeing as they acted impeccably in their planning and would likely to the same again, we simply "take two" and replay the encounter. Ideally, this is with newly rolled/established PCs to replace the dead, but if that's just going to be two rounds of character gen one-after-the-other, what's the point? I'll suspend hygiene here for the sake of playing the game itself.<br/><br/>On a different topic, could we talk a little more about Save Vs. Injury? Would it be possible to suspend the HP economy as-is and replace with a Save Vs. Injury roll (which I imagine is number to roll against that's a rolling together of AC, HP and some tactical positioning)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432333/#Comment_432333" name="Item_323" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-09T06:20:34+00:00" title="May  9, 2014  6:20AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve been following this awesome thread and its twin, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19310/osr-actual-play-greysands-campaign-call-for-irc-players/p1" rel="nofollow">[OSR Actual Play] Greysands Campaign - call for IRC players </a> because I, too, am interested in these hygienic techniques and OSR procedures.

However, it seems funny to be bringing this up on the seventh page of this discussion: wasn't that the goal of this thread in the first place? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>2. I really like the idea floated by here in the last two posts, about making character death a springboard for further play (thanks, WM!). More on this later...<br/><br/>3. I think my favourite line here is Eero's characterization of an OSR GM as a "curious scientist". That describes perfectly the type of feeling I most enjoy when playing this kind of D&amp;D, on both sides of the screen. As usual, Eero has a knack for finding just the right term for the occasion.<br/><br/>There's an interesting trade-off in play, I find, between random procedure and principled decisions. I think a very profitable line of thought here might be to tease out various principles which allow GMs to make decisions outside of the random matrix.<br/><br/>The basic negotiation of challenge at the table (as formulated by Eero as the foundation of this style of play) is a good basic principle to always return to, I think.<br/><br/>Ideas like "make character death a generator for future fictional details or colour" also make fine principles, as do things like "if high risk exists in your challenge-negotiation procedure, reflect the risk in the state or behaviour of the fictional world" (awful phrasing, but I'm referring to things like a highly deadly encounter table for an area being reflected with NPCs never going there out of fear, or common stories of death if they do anyway). I'd love to say more on this, but I'm out of time!<br/><br/>4. On the topic of "Save vs. Injury": this is something I've given a fair bit of thought. I think the nice feature of D&amp;D-style hit points which is hard to replicate with a "Save vs. Injury"-style mechanic is, perhaps ironically, the <i>predictability</i> of physical harm and injury.<br/><br/>For instance, take a typical first-level D&amp;D character. Let's say she has an average or better HP roll (e.g. 4 or 5 hit points).<br/><br/>If she gets hurt by some kind of attack or trap (typically 1d6 damage in our game here), she will mostly like survive the first blow, and almost certainly be killed by the second. There is a chance the first blow will kill her, yes, but that's a minority of situations. Similarly, her odds of surviving <i>three</i> blows are extremely low. (If she has 4 hit points, for example, the chance of her surviving three successful attacks is 3/216, or about 1%!)<br/><br/>With almost any kind of Save vs. Injury system, you will always have a decent chance of dying from any given blow, and often characters will be able to survive many, many attacks, due to lucky rolls. <br/><br/>Whether that's desirable or not is a good question. But it certainly feels very different.<br/><br/>(Yes, you could replicate this effect somewhat with Injury saves with increasing penalties, but then you just have hit points in a different form - the growing penalties - with an added randomizer on top.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432352/#Comment_432352" name="Item_327" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-09T11:43:54+00:00" title="May  9, 2014 11:43AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>4.

In play these are not in any way remarkable, because this caricature idea that players never got to make a single move is never entirely correct when you're playing in a sandbox and the characters actually get to choose their poison. You always feel like you had at least some input. I guess that might be different with an aggressive in-medias-res opening, but then the players presumably wouldn't mind a quick death - it's not in-medias-res if you're not already on the brink of disaster when it starts!<br/><br/>One of the closest examples in this regard involved a mysterious dungeon, a large stone block, and a more or less total party kill in the first danger of the dungeon. It was, as Paulo says, an important tempering experience for our campaign at the time: not one of the teenagers participating in that session left it without believing that the stakes are real and the GM really will just let you die in the most ignomious, stupid, funny way if you bring it on yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432355/#Comment_432355" name="Item_329" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-09T13:19:41+00:00" title="May  9, 2014  1:19PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a bit leery of "Save vs. Injury".

No reason the check or procedure can't be made as simple as desired (after all, we already do a damage roll and then subtraction from hit points with every hit, and presumably that's sufficiently simple). <br/><br/>I like Mike's earlier d6 roll for damage/survival, which I believe we hashed out in this thread. [Edit: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/431674#Comment_431674" rel="nofollow">Here's a direct link.</a>]<br/><br/>Still, however, the issue with save vs. injury/death mechanics tends to be an increased randomness in character survivability. Is this desirable for your game or not? That's your call.<br/><br/>There's a big difference between a D&amp;D character with hit points who can pretty reliable be killed in one or two hits and a "save vs. death" character who could conceivably still be standing after five or fall from the first. You have to remember that this also affects your monsters (assuming you use a similar system for them): do you like the idea that a lowly kobold (or whatever) might, on a good day, survive five blows and keep hacking at your PCs, and that your giant Ogre might fall from one arrow, or not?<br/><br/>(I feel like I hit my own sweet spot with my hit point hack for the moment: there exist odds of a 1-hit kill for any character, but the odds are incredibly low. Then again, I'm using standard D&amp;D hp for monsters, as well.)<br/><br/><i>Edit: Here's a potentially fun way of doing survivability in a D&amp;D system - assume that base hit points at first level represent physical fortitude, and only that. A 2-point wound is a 2-point wound, a gash of a particular size, on anyone. They're based on physical size and resilience. However, with experience, characters get faster, luckier, more resilient, whatever. This means sometimes they can get hit and just shrug it off, or just dodge out of the way, or whatever. <br/><br/>Clearly this is represented by hit points and damage in D&amp;D, so let's keep that principle. As a character advances, then they gain the ability to ignore a certain amount of damage. Maybe a 2nd level Fighter develops the ability to ignore 1-point hits, just shrugging them off. A 6th-level thief can just dodge any blow of 3 points or less. And so on. We have a small possible range (0-5 points, assuming a system where all attacks are 1d6 damage), but that doesn't bother me. It's simple and doesn't require an extra roll, plus it allows us to differentiate a solid hit from one that was avoided due to heroic ability (important for stuff like poison effects). <br/><br/>You could have a more heroic way (subtract this number from incoming damage), which gives high-level characters lots of resilience, or a less heroic way (low-damage attacks are ignored, but stronger attacks deal damage normally). Both methods have a few quirks but are otherwise clean and pretty D&amp;D-compatible.<br/><br/>We could even specify "how" these hit points work, should we want to. Maybe the fighter always gets them, but the thief must be mobile in order to benefit from the advantage, and the wizard only gets hit points equal to the number of spells she has memorized, as the magical energy helps protect her from injury.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432361/#Comment_432361" name="Item_332" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-09T14:38:22+00:00" title="May  9, 2014  2:38PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2014 3:18PM by Paul_T.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In terms of the question of randomness that I brought up here, I think the interesting distinction is between different ways of challenging player skill. I remember Ron Edwards used to have a term called "the Gamble" to refer to a particular form of Gamism - that always stuck with me.<br/><br/>On one end of the spectrum, we have deliberately deterministic games, which are non-random and therefore interact with player skill directly. (A good example is Chess - although there is a single minor random element even in Chess, in terms of who plays white and who plays black.)<br/><br/>At the other end we have the total gamble: we ante up something valuable and then flip a coin to see who gets it. <br/><br/>It's my hypothesis here that increasing hygienic behaviour in D&amp;D via aleatoric procedures (such as morale checks for monsters, for example) moves the game of D&amp;D further along this spectrum towards the "gamble" end. We can look at D&amp;D as a game to challenge the players' skills, but sometimes the game turns into something not unlike a venture into a casino: you can venture in and choose which slot machines to play, how often, and how much to spend, but other than that, your skills are pretty irrelevant. Your job is to estimate the risk and then pull the lever, but the game is set up so that the risk doesn't vary a whole lot.<br/><br/>(I've seen modules like this, with undetectable traps which include save-or-die effects in every room of a dungeon, or similar.)<br/><br/>I'm curious if you, kind readers, agree with this assessment or not. (I'm testing it out, you see, not stating it as a settled fact.)<br/><br/>I'm also curious what kinds of devices or techniques move the game closer to the former end of the spectrum (chess-like). I'll brainstorm a few:<br/><br/>* Less random construction of encounters, using information set in stone instead (e.g. using pre-written modules)<br/>* The concept of "balanced" encounters, "balanced" treasure, and so forth<br/>* Principled fictional or adjudicative decision-making (a la Apocalypse World - for instance, a principle like "always include a chance of success, however slight, in any situation", or "whenever there is a significant chance of death, telegraph it to the players somehow" - for example, if there is a death trap down a hallway, put a skeleton or a bloodstain, or let the players know that all the locals say that no one ever goes there for some reason)<br/>* Non-random determination of outcomes (i.e. "roleplaying" through the disarming of a trap rather than rolling, referee making "sensible" calls instead of randomizing along a spectrum - the monsters flee when their leader is killed of when they see their net is destroyed, not when they fail a morale check, that kind of thing)<br/>* Less random character abilities or resolution procedures (e.g. all characters start with 6 hit points, all monsters do 5 hits of damage, etc.)<br/>* Resolution of events based on research/trial ("to see how likely it is that you could throw your axe through the hole, let's use the doorway here, stand at an appropriate distance, and make ten throws and see how many make it through")<br/>* Pure negotiation of outcomes based on fictional positioning (rather than making the game like Chess, this makes it like Poker, perhaps)<br/>* Etc.<br/><br/>This is interesting: some of these are mutually contradictory, others impractical, yet others very difficult to apply in a hygienic fashion. <br/><br/>Some lead to their own undesirable outcomes or situations. (For example, making "balanced" encounters undermines the players' ability to choose the level of risk they wish to engage, which makes a lot of player decisions irrelevant.)<br/><br/>What are your experiences with this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432383/#Comment_432383" name="Item_333" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-10T14:53:20+00:00" title="May 10, 2014  2:53PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            that is the job of the magic-user: the best spells, and almost all of them in OD&amp;D, are ones that avoid mentioning things like HP and morale.

For instance, consider a system like this:<br/><br/>* Every character has a "combat readiness" or "hit point" score, in the range of a regular ability score (typically around 10). It could be based by class, with a Constitution modifier, and plus the character's level, or just equal to Constitution + level, or whatever.<br/><br/>* When they're hit, they subtract the damage received from this score and make an ability check against the new score.<br/><br/>* On a success, they're fine: they got out of the way, the blow didn't really affect them, they got lucky, they shrug it off.<br/>* On a failure, it's a real wound: they got hit, but they can keep fighting. Nothing game mechanical, but this is important if there's poison involved or it's duel to the first blood. He's been hit; that's significant fictionally if not mechanically.<br/>* On a failure by 5 or more, it's a serious wound: it takes them out of the fight.<br/>* On a failure by 10 or more, the wound is fatal.<br/><br/>Say our cleric has a Con/HP/whatever of 10. He's hit by a goblin spear for 3 damage. That means his score goes down to 7, and he must make a check against it, rolling a d20. On a 1-7 (35%), he shrugs it off. On a 8-11 (20%), the spear got him but he can ignore it for now. On a 12-16 (25%), the wound is bad enough that he's on the floor, incapacitated. On a 17-20 (20%), he's been run through.<br/><br/>If he rolls well and shrugs it off, the next blow will still hurt: Let's say the next attack is 4 damage. Now his HP is 3, so a roll of 1-3 is him getting lucky (15%), 4-7 is a non-important wound (%20), 8-12 (25%) is a debilitating injury, and 13-20 (40%) is death.<br/><br/>This is a little complex, but combines the positive features of hit points and save vs. injury mechanics, with the additional feature of letting us have high hit point characters who seem to dodge blows all the time as well as a distinct way to tell whether they did so or not with each attack - something you can't normally do if hit points have to do with reflexes and luck.<br/><br/>Is it worth it? I don't know. It doesn't feel very D&amp;D to me anymore, and the procedure's starting to feel like a lot of work.)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433190/#Comment_433190" name="Item_335" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T14:07:52+00:00" title="May 29, 2014  2:07PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been running an OSR campaign for a few weeks now, and I wanted to write about it on my blog.

I'm kind of surprised that people seem to consider it to be a bit of a non-issue: it seems to me that, in this style of "challenge-based adventure gaming", the random element present in various considerations affects the gameplay dramatically.<br/><br/>Consider the difference between a GM who uses a procedure like "roll a die to see which character gets attacked by the monster this turn" versus a GM who says, "this monster attacks whoever is wearing the colour red". <br/><br/>Chase rules are another good example, as Christopher points out, with a coin flip at one end of the spectrum and a simple comparison of movement rates (as in B/X D&amp;D) at the other end.<br/><br/>At any point in the resolution process, the level of randomness involved will, it seems to me, dramatically change how the game is played and how it feels. Consider something like Morale checks in B/X D&amp;D, for example. Here's a basic spectrum of more- to less-random approaches to handling monster morale:<br/><br/>1. Every round of combat, flip three coins. If all of them come up "heads", the monster flees.<br/>2. Every round of combat, roll a d20. If the monster's roll is below its "morale" score, the monster flees.<br/>3. Roll for morale when one of their number is killed, and again when half of them are killed. If the roll is lower than the monsters' morale score, they flee.<br/>4. Roll for morale when appropriate conditions are met; add 1 if the PCs have encountered these monsters and defeated them before, subtract 1 if the monsters defeated the adventurers.<br/>5. Each monster will fight for a number of rounds equal to its morale score. After that, it flees.<br/>6. An Orc will flee if it is reduced below half its hit points. Goblins will flee if at any point in the fight they are outnumbered. A lycanthrope will flee after being struck with a silver weapon for the first time.<br/><br/><br/>The question becomes: are there principled ways to decide where along the spectrum we wish to place the "randomness" dial, and is it something we can see fluctuating in play, or should it be uniform and predictable?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434074/#Comment_434074" name="Item_342" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-19T10:25:33+00:00" title="June 19, 2014 10:25AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Randomness is used for so many purposes, and in such nuanced ways, that I can't off-hand perceive any snappy general principle in there; rather, I feel pretty certain that trying for an "uniform" amount of randomness would be a mistake, as so many of the random elements in the game are unique artistic choices made in a complex organic context. For example, the focus of the game on different issues influences the use of randomness heavily, as does the GM's particular style and the nature of their currently available methodological tool-set.<br/><br/>As a practical example, I generally allow players to make various types of knowledge checks to find out whether their characters know anything interesting or relevant about various topics, and once we find out whether they do, I whip up the actual content in combination of referencing my own notes and thinking up interesting details on the spot. This is a highly unique procedure that combines my personal habits and strengths as a GM with the campaign premise that knowledge almost always matters, and it is a diffuse, organic thing that cannot be sufficiently modeled by simple info-dumps. Many D&amp;D campaigns - the majority really - do not share those particularities, but that doesn't make them methodologically erraneous, despite the outcome being that they use randomness differently in relation to player/character knowledge.<br/><br/>An attempt at a general analysis of the matter would be to note some of the most important reasons for using randomness. Most of those can in my thinking be classified under the motivation of "glossing" or "abstracting" or "resolving", which are all slightly different ways of saying that we need to establish how a fictional situation resolves into another fictional situation, and our particular limitations as human beings (as opposed to gods, who would presumably play their games of divinity on the canvas of the world as ancient Greeks had it) cause us to need methods that simplify and ignore highly complex processes into something manageable. Thus, instead of carefully calculating the location and trajectory of each discrete body involved in the fictional situation, we pinpoint some important teleological outcomes and randomize between them. Instead of simulating the arc of an arrow, we roll against odds to find whether the arrow hits anything important.<br/><br/>Note that almost anything can be either abstractly glossed or established in detail in a D&amp;D type game - it would be a mistake to think comfortably that the game's traditional rules and procedures somehow depict a necessary reality, rather than a conventional one. For example, it would be entirely feasible to replace the equipment purchase element in the game with a gloss where each player decides their character's encumbrance level (how much stuff they brought with them to the adventure) and purchase price (how much money they spent on it) at the start, and then we roll dice against those amount &amp; quality factors whenever we need to find out whether a character happens to have an useful piece of equipment available for a given situation. This would radically alter a particular procedure that is almost never altered in D&amp;D, replacing consideration and skill with randomness. It has advantages and disadvantages that I would characterize simply as "artistic", as described above. There's no clear way to say out of context which procedure might be better for a given campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434078/#Comment_434078" name="Item_343" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-19T11:01:53+00:00" title="June 19, 2014 11:01AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2014 11:02AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's no question that, on a theoretical level, all these approaches are valid. I'm curious how you (or anyone else reading) has found this balance in play, whether it occurs more so in certain situations and others, and whether your approach to it has changed over time.<br/><br/>(The randomized equipment is a great example of this! There's no particular reason that we choose to randomize character ability scores but not class; starting wealth but not the actual equipment; the rate of advancement - via prime requisite bonuses - but not starting experience level, and so on.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436235/#Comment_436235" name="Item_344" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T08:42:51+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  8:42AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious if this discussion is still rolling.  A lot of interesting threads still to follow.<br/><br/>Paul, I don't know if this qualifies as a skill-based mechanic, but you could run combat like the bidding in Nobilis.<br/><br/>Ex: When you make an attack, you bid on your attack bonus while the opponent bids on their defense bonus.<br/><br/>The resources available for this bid could utilize a number of methods:<br/>- Each player has a hand of playing cards numbered 1 - 10.  Cards 2 - 9 are spent until you use them all, but you can always take back card <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  The DM's cards perhaps apply to an entire group or faction he's playing, but maybe he gets more cards (* the number of players, perhaps)<br/>- A secondary resource pool (an effort pool) that is also replenished with resting along with Hit Points.  Maybe this is where attributes could come in.  So a fighter's resource pool would probably be Strength, or Dex for ranged attacks.  A wizard's for spells that require a roll would be Int, etc.<br/>- Combine the two above (you use up cards, but how many you get is based on your stats)<br/>- You bid your hit points.  On a successful strike or defense, you get half of them back. (The game would need to provide more HP to accommodate this)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d/p6" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d/p6" rel="prev">6</a><a class="Highlight p-7 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d/p7">7</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19234%2Fx%2Fp7%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19234%2Fx%2Fp7%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
