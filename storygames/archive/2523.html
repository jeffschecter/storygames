Very nice place, large and spacious, lots of comfortable chairs and tables, wireless internet, good coffee and great food. They let local groups get together there for different things - guitar class, Bible study, tax help, whatever. It looks like a great place to run a game (as long as you don't get super noisy). They have a bulletin board of course.<br/><br/>While sipping my java, I had an idea to stick a flyer on that bulletin board and try to recruit some players for a Dogs in the Vineyard game. However, my point would be to try and recruit total newbies - people who've never played any RPG whatsoever.<br/><br/>Now when you stick a flyer up in your LGS, you don't need to explain anything about what RPGs are - you just say "Looking for players, yadayada" and the people who look at it know what's up.<br/><br/>How can I pitch DitV in such a way that people who might see the flyer on the bulletin board in the coffee shop are interested enough to give it a shot? I don't know really what to say except it's got to be short and sweet, fit on a B5 sized piece of paper, and pitched toward complete newbs.<br/><br/>Chances are if I do this I'll get some gamers anyway, and that's cool, but my target is complete and total newbs.<br/><br/>Suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58170/#Comment_58170" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T20:44:02+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  8:44PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps calling in a "game" might be part of the problem.  I am just coming out of left field here, but after my last DitV game, I walked away thinking something like "This is not a game.  This is an interactive morality play that looks like a game."  For my money, that makes it more awesome.  That might also attract some folks who are might not respond as well to the word "game."  But then it could also backfire.<br/><br/>Another element, and this might not help you sell the idea, is that in my experience gamers are more comfortable with playing with religious ideas than non-gamers.  I suspect this is partly because of deities in fantasy settings, but I get this more from the folks I've encountered randomly who have given me grief over gaming.  One guy in my group calls it "Mormonism with the serial numbers filled off," but you might consider what could happen if you put those serial numbers back on.<br/><br/>Just my two cents.  In any case, I hope it turns out well for you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58175/#Comment_58175" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T21:30:47+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  9:30PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gee, it's a lot easier to come up with very bad ways to promote the game, like "Let's pretend to be homicidal Mormons!" <br/><br/>But try stressing the Morality play-cum-Western angle.

Intriguing art from the book? The cover you mean? ;-)<br/><br/>I had a gander at the DitV website and the copy there could work.\n<blockquote><br/>"You stand between God's law and the best intentions of the weak.<br/><br/>You stand between God's people and their own demons.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's better for one to die than for many to suffer.

Dogs is going to be a hard one to sell to non-gamers in the Bay Area, I would think.  And TMW is pretty intense for someone who has never played a RPG before.<br/><br/>Next month I'm running Cat for my fiance's girlfriends who play nothing more complicated than Gin Rummy or Hearts.  And I'm planning on running 1001 Nights for some other non-gamer friends soon after.  Those are both pretty low-key games with some relatively popular subject matter.  Prime Time Adventures might be another good and approachable idea.<br/><br/>I totally agree that it's best to leave the term "role-playing game" out.  I always refer to them as "story games" and thus I never get the dreaded "D&amp;D smirk" from people.  I think you are on the right track.  Just consider picking something that's going to appeal to a wider audience and is a bit more approachable.  Or at least make the effort to tie the subject matter to something in pop culture that they can relate to like 'Lost' or 'Heroes' or anything.<br/><br/>Just my two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58182/#Comment_58182" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T00:23:09+00:00" title="February 28, 2007 12:23AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2007 12:31AM by Larry.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Pseudo-Mormon gunslinger paladins in an Old West that never quite was" always struck me as the most effective one-line pitch for <i>Dogs</i>. I suppose you have to know what a fantasy-trope paladin is, though.<br/><br/>I guess I think the practice of soliciting total strangers based on game-store want ads is a little weird to begin with. Eerily like publishing a romantic personals ad -- sure you might land a gem of a person, but you can also fairly expect such an impersonal process to attract some poor fits. I'm not sure how the game-store ad in a coffee shop can be less weird. <br/><br/>Simply throwing out the name of a game system or an image of a kewl guy looking tough is probably not (sarcastic understatement) sufficient to communicate what sort of social activity will actually be taking place. Have you heard Ron's "<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20679.msg215148#msg215148" rel="nofollow">love pig</a>" explanation of creative agenda? Well, who follows up to a poster that reads "PigCon 2007" illustrated by a cute cartoon porker? Maybe... not the people you were expecting at all.<br/><br/>It's advertising. It seems to me that you've got to decide what sort of people you might want to attract and might want to <i>not</i> attract, and tailor your pitch, particularly the color, accordingly. I suppose you can always cast a broad net and rely on some sort of interview process to clarify social expectations. Since it's a coffee shop, the on-and-off discussions around here about "de-geeking" gaming seem appropriate to consider.<br/><br/>I'm a little conflicted about trying to whitewash the "role-playing game" language. Given the total lack of context, if you try to be too coy or ambiguous about it, people may assume you're talking about sex. Presumably, not what you're soliciting.<br/><br/>[Edited, like, a bunch of times.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58202/#Comment_58202" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T04:02:42+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  4:02AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs is a role-playing game.

That being the especially social aspect of RPGs, especially those like PTA or DitV. That's not me saying that I think you shouldn't do this. But I think that the social framework has to be right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, think of this as advertising a personal on the board for a first date. Or, even better, a mixer. I think that the analogy holds. Are the people who show up going to be folks you'd hang around with just because they were bold enough to respond to your thing on the bulletin board? You could get lucky. Or you might not.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresent it this way. You're showing folks a demo. You're making the pilot, if it's PTA. There's no committment on anybody's part to play further sessions (like a game at a con), just this one session.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, if it turns out that you find some cool folks, invite them back for more sessions (and this is key) on a different week night. Encourage folks to purchase the game, if they like at the demo, and to start their own game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do the demo thing enough, you may end up starting several games, ones that you're not even involved with. The shop might end up crawling with them every night, who knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point is that you don't want to end up playing multiple sessions with folks who you don't feel comfortable with socially. The setting is right for a very casual game where you can spend a lot of time getting to know the players as you play.

Cafe games are a really cool idea, but I think that trying to run Dogs in that style is taking your preachin' gun and shooting yourself in the foot with it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58469/#Comment_58469" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T06:58:15+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  6:58AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In this thread, we learn the truth about <i>Cats</i> and <i>Dogs</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58473/#Comment_58473" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T07:12:20+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  7:12AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of good comments about "Open Meetups" in this thread: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2532/" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2532/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58527/#Comment_58527" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T12:21:47+00:00" title="March  1, 2007 12:21PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>But I think that the social framework has to be right.</blockquote>\nCouldn't agree with you more.\n<blockquote>Present it this way.

There's no committment on anybody's part to play further sessions (like a game at a con), just this one session.<br><br>Then, if it turns out that you find some cool folks, invite them back for more sessions (and this is key) on a different week night.

I'm not out to form a new game group as much as I'm out to simply introduce people to the idea. So in that sense, approaching it as a demo (which is what it would be essentially) is the tack I'm taking.\n<blockquote>But the point is that you don't want to end up playing multiple sessions with folks who you don't feel comfortable with socially. The setting is right for a very casual game where you can spend a lot of time getting to know the players as you play.
