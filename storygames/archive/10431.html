Where someone described everything in first person while someone else used third person. Where someone asked me questions about what the environment smelled and felt like... they wanted to be immersed, to feel like they were there while someone else just wanted to get to the meat of the conflict and leave the flavorful details aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe play games with all these people at the same time. Often they are imagining completely different things. In some ways, playing almost different games. And still interacting. And still having fun together!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't get me wrong, there are certainly many, many, many examples of these different styles clashing and causing many problems (maybe these examples are the majority!). The point of this post is that I've seen these styles blend together in ways that amaze me and work perfectly functional. RPGs can be neat that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232043/#Comment_232043" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-12T16:01:53+00:00" title="September 12, 2009  4:01PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2009 4:09PM by J_Walton.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After helping organize weekly open pick-up games for the past 3 years all I can say is... word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232047/#Comment_232047" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-12T16:20:25+00:00" title="September 12, 2009  4:20PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a question John:<br><br>Are they blending together, or are they just co-existing, on almost parallel worlds, so to speak? are the person who cares for gaming the system and the person who just want to get to the meat of the conflict in any way aided by the person who asks about flavour?

I've seen this as well. <br><br>Also in Dogs, a player who is gaming it hard may give up in conflicts quite a bit which creates great story material for other players who may be in it more for the fictional situation.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232082/#Comment_232082" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T05:52:58+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  5:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "In A Wicked Age" is also capable of this. From my experience, it accommodates many different styles well. But you do need to get significant player input in the form of Best Interests up front, so that can be a hurdle for someone with a really passive style where they want everything to come from the GM so they can smash it. But after that it works well and I even see blending of the styles because the PCs are often fighting each other in game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
