The foul ones have painted an inscription over the entrance in slowly drying entrails.  You gradually decipher the demon scrawl to read:\n<blockquote>(pour) (salt) [plural] [mark subsequent phrase as object] (you) [possessive] (dear) (person) [plural];<br/>(she) [plural] [possessive] (grave) [plural] (negative) (contain) (previous object) (long time)</blockquote>\nEach encapsulated word or set of words is a single ideograph, making the inscription a rhyming couplet, each line containing nine ideographs.  Those in brackets are purely grammatical, altering the meaning of the ideographs that came immediately before it, with the exception of [mark subsequent phrase as object], which changes the meaning of the ideographs that follow.  Also, this isn't like Greek, where you can move all the words around and keep the same meaning.  Word order matters.<br/><br/>What does the inscription say?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150611/#Comment_150611" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T15:23:56+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  3:23PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't read the comments if you want to work it out for yourself!<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>OKAY GOOD!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150619/#Comment_150619" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T16:02:10+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  4:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pour salt upon the dear departed save<br/>\nThey rise unshriven from the grave                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson" title="Zak Arntson"><img alt="Zak Arntson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/147/nVMQWQSYECWCV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson">Zak Arntson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150629/#Comment_150629" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T16:34:39+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  4:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 4:34PM by Zak Arntson.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pour your salt on a loved one; ancient women's graves.<br/><br/>Loved = dear.

Imagine the inscription looks something like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/script.jpg"/><br/><br/>Now, the second ideograph is read "k'plahgtor," which is demon for "salt."  That's a word by itself, a noun.  But when combined with "atk" which comes after it, the ideograph that denotes that a non-living thing is plural, it becomes "k'plahgtoratk" which means "salts" or "a large quantity of salt."  Note that, despite being two ideographs now, it is still one word, one idea, "a bunch of salt."  However, the original ideograph, "k'plahgtor," is also pronounced with two syllables.<br/><br/>Confused yet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150750/#Comment_150750" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T11:20:10+00:00" title="June 14, 2008 11:20AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to black out my original intentions, to not spoil it for folks.<br/><br/>Literally:<br/><br/>Pour lots of salt on your dear people;<br/>Their graves won't contain them for a long time<br/><br/>Or, more poetically:<br/><br/>Salt your dead;<br/>The earth shall not hold them long<br/><br/><br/>Arcana or History Check reveals this to be the slogan of the <a href="http://wizards.com/dnd/files/364_AshenCovenant.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ebon Riders</a>, a dark mercenary company tied to Orcus.<br/><br/>If you got anywhere close to that, you have successfully seized the Orcusword!<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/orcusword.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150765/#Comment_150765" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T13:06:44+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  1:06PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, conjugations and especially tense would be helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150768/#Comment_150768" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T13:39:15+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  1:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2008 1:39PM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was modeling it on Chinese grammer, which has neither.

There's an odd problem with the way your first line translates. Specifically, in your literal translation, the object is "salt," not "your dear people" (which is the object of the preposition that isn't indicated). The way I am understanding your grammar, "(pour) (salt) [plural]" has to represent a single verb, which is a bit confusing. Otherwise, I'd expect something like "(pour) [mark subsequent phrase as direct object] (salt) [plural] [mark subsequent phrase as indirect object] (you) [possessive] (dear) (person) [plural]". The literal interpretation of "salt" as a single verb is more likely to be "preserve" or something like it.<br/><br/>Another thing is that the absence of a subject doesn't necessarily mean that the sentence is in the imperative mood. In fact, I was beginning to thing that there was a presumed first person subject. (I was working with "I bleed your loved ones.") It might pay to be thorough and indicate the imperative in some way. Combining these two ideas, you might get a first line similar to:\n<blockquote>(you) (preserve) [imperative] [mark subsequent phrase as object] (you) [possessive] (dear) (person) [plural]</blockquote>\nIn the second line, "(previous object)" is a bit vague in English. I'm assuming it means "object of the previous clause" (which then obviates the need for a grammatical marker that the object phrase is beginning).<br/><br/>Also, I find it interesting that "(negative)" is considered a word and not a grammatical marker. Is there a reason for this?<br/><br/>And as for the nongendered pronoun, you can always make the ideogram translation "(she or he)", but I kind of like the implication that the default gendered pronoun in this language is "she."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151004/#Comment_151004" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T08:24:42+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  8:24AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I got Paul Czege's interpretation.

I'm trying to figure out the fine line between making the linguistic construction super accurate and including some of those little linguistic idiosyncrasies and shortcuts that all languages have.  Chinese and English both have subjectless imperatives ("Go to the store!"), so I was assuming Abyssal would have one, with all the shouting that goes on in Hell.  But, you're right, that makes the labeling of the object more difficult.  Hmm... Instead of (preserve), I'd probably choose something a bit more demonic and gross, like (pickle).  The idea that demons are telling you to pickle your deceased loved ones is nice and icky.  And, yeah, (negative) should probably be [negative]<br/><br/><b>James:</b> Yeah, tenses are tough.  Most ideographic writing systems I'm vaguely familiar with are used to encode languages that don't have explicit tense markers.  For example, Chinese has time words ("Tomorrow go to the store!"), but the verb itself doesn't change; you just make the time explicit if it's important.  But, yeah, if players are looking for tenses, not having them is going to make translation very hard.  It probably needs another couple clues.<br/><br/>In the future, I was thinking of an encounter where players can try to overhear a conversation between two demons and, based on their checks and how close they sneak up, they get more or less of the conversation.  So you'd end up with something like...\n<blockquote>Grakjish (tower) [possessive] hajdus (kill) [past tense] slagtrok sidhisjah [!!!]</blockquote>\nYes, the [!!!] means that demons have a tense to indicate violent rage.  Maybe I could color code the words for various DCs, giving out just the meanings that the players got close enough to hear and translate properly?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151011/#Comment_151011" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T09:07:14+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  9:07AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, I think you're making too many assumptions about the similarity between demonic and English.<br/><br/>Deomonic grammar might be, in general, (agent) verb topic (object marker) (object), with the imperative mood formed by dropping the agent, who is assumed to be the audience of the utterance.

Like, make a language that lacks verbs. Maybe it's a colony of alien ants or something, where the particular context of a situation uniquely dictates what any member of the group would do. Thus "vacant low hill at noon near food" is clearly understood (by any member of the group) as an imperative to climb to the top of that hill and scout for threats to the food source. You never need to describe action at all if everyone does the same thing in response to a given stimulus, you just need to describe the stimulus.<br/><br/>This could also work in reverse if action uniquely correlates with stimulus.

There's a colloquial verb inflection (-tte yagaru or stem + yagaru) that expresses distaste for the topic. Then there's a set of sentence-final particles (ne, na, yo, zo, ze) that can... hell I don't even know how to say what they do. Carry a little bit of data with regards to the speaker's emotion and the utterance's intent, I guess. Both of those stack right on top of the normal grammar for tense, aspect, and mood.<br/><br/>If demonic had a regular system of, say, marking nouns and verbs with emotional data for not just anger but also other fun emotions like fear, contempt, and malice, that'd be pretty neat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151089/#Comment_151089" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T16:34:53+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  4:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeph</cite> Then there's a set of sentence-final particles (ne, na, yo, zo, ze) that can... hell I don't even know how to say what they do.

They're really context dependant, and they're the kind of thing that sounds totally wrong if you think too much about using them before you do.  I've just about got a handle on "ne" (which is kind of like saying "huh", as in, "It's sunny today, huh"), but there's a Hokkaido specific one, "be" which is totally impossible.  It's kind of like the Australasian habit of adding "mate" to the end of sentences, but it's freaking hard to use.  It's annoying, because I can see that the particles are a really cool thing about Japanese, and basically the best way to stop sounding like a dumb foreigner, but it's way difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151094/#Comment_151094" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T17:25:37+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  5:25PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They have those particles in Chinese too, especially in colloquial dialects. Ya, la, ne, na, lou, ng, etc.  That's part of where my inspiration is coming from.  That, the inverted question and exclamation marks at the beginning of Spanish sentences, and, my favorite of all, the mysterious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang" rel="nofollow">interrobang</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
