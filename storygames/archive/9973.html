In case you haven't seen these cards, they say stuff like this:\n<blockquote>Somebody important to this character faces dire trouble because of the element you own \u2013 life-threatening illness, bankruptcy, doubt in their faith or similar.<br/><br/>This character does something rash that causes them a lot of trouble with the element you own. An unwise sexual liaison; insulting an ally; destruction of property.<br/><br/>An area on the map is threatened. An attack by enemies, a natural disaster, a change from within or similar.<br/><br/>Someone from this character's past suddenly appears in an area on the map, with a request or demand.<br/><br/>The element you own is interfering with this character's desires, wishes or needs.<br/><br/>Something important is stolen from this character by someone connected to the element you own.<br/><br/>The element you own changes allegiance, motivation or direction in a surprising way.<br/><br/>This character receives an unwanted and troublesome gift from an area on the map.<br/><br/>The element you own claims an old debt from this character.<br/><br/>This character makes an enemy in the element you own.</blockquote>\nAnd the resolution cards:\n<blockquote>Yes, but\u2026 The character succeeds, but something completely unrelated goes wrong, for the character or someone she cares about.<br/><br/>Yes, but only if\u2026 The character can get what she wants \u2013 but only if she chooses to make a certain sacrifice.<br/><br/>Yes, and\u2026 The character succeeds, and achieves more than she expected. Perhaps even a bit too much\u2026<br/><br/>Yes, but\u2026 The character succeeds, but the consequences of the success are completely different from what was expected.<br/><br/>No, but\u2026 The character fails, but another positive thing happens instead, unrelated to what she was aiming for.<br/><br/>Yes, but\u2026 The character succeeds, but there\u2019s a tiny detail that doesn\u2019t go quite as planned.<br/><br/>Help is needed. The character ends up understanding that she needs the help of someone not currently in the scene to achieve this aim.<br/><br/>No, and\u2026 The character fails, and something unrelated also goes wrong.</blockquote>\nMost of these are great as-is, I'm just looking for some more examples of these kinds of cards that are specific and appropriate for YA stories.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221587/#Comment_221587" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T05:45:59+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  5:45AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's where I'm going with this, just to give you a little more context:<br/><br/>You're playing Do. You just described your character resolving a trouble. Now you draw three stones from the bag and choose to keep either the white stones or the black stones. Whichever ones you don't keep go back in the bag, the ones you do keep are compared to this board.<br/><br/>---------------<br/><b>Liftoff</b><br/><br/>Zero Stones:<br/>\u2714 Troublemakers tell a story: Because of this pilgrim's act, something unexpectedly goes wrong for the character belonging to the player on the Storyteller's left (if the set is black) or right (if this set is white) That character faces dire trouble related to the letter's first symbol.<br/>\u2714 The Storyteller records this situation on a new trouble card and adds !!!.<br/><br/>One Stone:<br/>\u2714 Troublemakers tell a story: Because of this pilgrim's act, the letter-writer is enamored (\u25cf) or furious (\u25cb) with her, leading to a trouble related to the letter's second symbol.<br/>\u2714 The Storyteller records this situation on a new trouble card and adds !!.<br/><br/>Two Stones:<br/>\u2714 Troublemakers tell a story: The pilgrim achieves more than she expected. Perhaps even a bit too much. Describe how being too successful gets this pilgrim in trouble. This trouble is related to the letter's second symbol (\u25cb\u25cb) or the third symbol (\u25cf\u25cf).<br/>\u2714 The Storyteller records this situation on a new trouble card and adds !.<br/><br/>Three Stones:<br/>\u2714 The Storyteller tells a story: Your pilgrim achieves her goal, but has inadvertently changed a bond to the character belonging to the player on your left (\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf) or right (\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb). Describe why this Bond has changed.<br/><br/>If your grace set is \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf, move to the board titled "<b>Shocking Revelations</b>."<br/>If your grace set is \u25cb\u25cb\u25cb, move to the board titled "<b>Wonderful World of Wonderment</b>."<br/>-----------<br/><br/>After this first board, each subsequent board follows a theme. For example, "Shocking Revelations" troubles related to revealed secrets or misunderstandings while "Wonderful World of Wonderment" creates troubles related to the world and the letter-writer. Those are just off the top of my head though, and it might be too much.<br/><br/>In any case, I'm just looking for more examples of randomly generated situations like you might find in Archipelago 2, Shab-al-Hiri Roach and Once Upon a Time, but that fit the young adult coming-of-age genre more specifically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
