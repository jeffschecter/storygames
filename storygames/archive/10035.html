I've been invited as a guest to run RPGs and talk about Life In Japan and stuff.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.animeusa.org/locationhotel/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.animeusa.org/locationhotel/</a><br/><br/>In short, I'm looking for someone who lives like within 30 minutes or so of Crystal City who wouldn't mind hosting me (couches welcome!) for that Saturday night, November 21st (possibly Friday as well, but honestly I'm looking mainly at Saturday night only at this point).<br/><br/>I'll reimburse you for my presence.</blockquote>\nThere's an anime con over in DC that I was invited to, and basically I'm looking for a place to crash. Or, alternately, if there are 2-3 other anime-gamers in that area that want to split a room for that night, that's a thought as well. But mostly I'm looking for a couch hookup.<br/><br/>However, if you're interested in going and possibly running your anime RPG-themed events (TonyLB?), hit me up and I'll see about getting you into the gaming schedule.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
