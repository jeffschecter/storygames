We can say concrete, tangible things about what folks do and games they play. We have folks from many of these traditions reading/posting here, so doing a survey of that type may even be productive and informative.<br/><br/>The word freeform is also used for aspects of play (frex freeform traits, freeform play). Let's see if we can come to shared definitions of them as well. <br/><br/>Let's start with a list of self-defined freeform and play aspects. Add to it then chime in with descriptions, links etc as you see ones you're knowledgeable about.

In other words, when two characters are in conflict, it's the <i>players</i> who decide what happens, based on, well, whatever they like, but probably including their sense of the character, the pacing of the scene, and so on. The pressure on the characters to escalate and to bring issues into the open and resolve them is brought by the scene structure, rather than a resolution system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321972/#Comment_321972" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T14:03:06+00:00" title="April 27, 2011  2:03PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many people I've played D&amp;D with spend half their game doing what they call "freeform roleplaying". <br/><br/>Out of combat, they don't roll dice, use formal game mechanics, and can't force anyone to do anything but there are limitations:<br/><br/>- You can only say what your character does.<br/>- You can't break everyone's suspension of disbelief.

Lets not discuss that, but keep it in mind when using the term.<br/><br/>It is interesting to see how most freeform games start up <i>free</i>, and then develops a more or less defined <i>form</i> as the interplay deepens. The process from free to form is an interesting aspect of these games, in my view.<br/><br/>So, to me, the freeform game is initiated with some idea of us having a game together. Sometimes one of us has a theme or a conflict, sometimes we start with a brainstorm. Once the initial premise is laid down, we start playing, and negotiating how to play, at the same time. So we partake in a process which is open toward its goal, with the intention of letting the narrative sprout whatever branches which "feels right". Preferably the narrative will lead us somewhere none of us has decided, but where all of us, eventually, find it engaging to go.<br/><br/>Our intuition is at the forefront in such games. Freeform games are at their best when we manage to work our intuitions into a symbiotic flow, letting one word follow the next in a seamless stream of shared consciousness. <br/><br/>I've been in a select few games where the <i>free</i> has gone into <i>form</i>, and then left it behind again, to follow a <i>flow</i> that eludes any form. Having that experience is the ideal of freeform, to me. <br/><br/>Hope this made some sense to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321974/#Comment_321974" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T14:08:40+00:00" title="April 27, 2011  2:08PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good examples, Jenskot and Simon. <br/><br/>Tomas, does that description match games you play or that are played in your community?

"Not in question" could be read as "not disputed", for example.  And "structured" is open to various interpretations as well.<br/><br/>Let me try a different take, and maybe we can find a productive overlap.<br/><br/><i>free/freeform play</i>- Role playing that does not consult formal rules or procedures to determine what happens next in play.  Fictional events are determined only by (a) implicit or explicit reference to in-fiction facts, and/or (b) implicit reference to principles of play.  A moment of thinking or speaking, "there's a principle that states X, thus in this case we should do Y" <i>is not</i> a moment of free/freeform play, while simply doing Y without bringing X up <i>is</i> freeform.<br/><br/>I know that definition sounds very restrictive, but remember, this isn't about freeform gaming in total!  It's just describing the act of playing freeform itself.  My thought is that games mostly get called freeform or not based on how often and in what circumstances they do the above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321980/#Comment_321980" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T15:13:57+00:00" title="April 27, 2011  3:13PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>*<b>nod</b>* Is that grouped?

Our end of the hobby frantically closes its eyes and sticks its fingers in its ears whenever it comes up, so I don't think there's a good term for it.

The GM then says what happens next as a result. Rinse and repeat.<br/><br/>If the GM isn't sure what happens next, they may ask someone to roll percentile dice. It is generally accepted that 01 is the best thing that could possibly happen and 00 the worst, although that's not binding. The roll is just to help the GM decide when in doubt. If the roll is middling and the GM isn't sure what to do with it, rerolls may be requested until a decisive result appears.<br/><br/>That's about it, more or less.

I've played these sort of games ever so often, and it has mostly been under the label "freeform". We may say: "Lets do some freeform", and then we sit down and work out what the game should be about, and play it. No prep, no rules, no bounds. I even do "freeform"-playing in my own classical game Fabula; that is; we play the setting, leaving the method behind. It is a great way of focussing on one particular part of the setting, exploring it in ways that the method does not permit.<br/><br/>Ole Peder Giev\xe6r (one of the designers of <i>Itras City</i>) loves this way of playing. <i>Itras City</i> has been made to capture just this aspect of freeform; the free-flow, all-directing kind of gameplay. At its best it gives a lot of energy to the interaction.<br/><br/>This easter me and my boys (8 and 11) made a game that way, which we eventually called "The Map Game". The first game was totally freeform, and then we repeated it, each day during easter, making it into a fully developed game. It's ultra light in rules, and is very much about all of us putting whatever we like into it, so the boys like it very much. And the later games has kept some of the energy from the first, freeform game-session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_322015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322015/#Comment_322015" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T23:00:10+00:00" title="April 27, 2011 11:00PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Come to think of it, maybe <i>freeflow</i>-games is a better term ... :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322017/#Comment_322017" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T23:10:40+00:00" title="April 27, 2011 11:10PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick aside... freeform as a term came from music as early as the 1960s where DJs could play whatever they wanted on the radio free of structure, target genre, playlists, restriction of when to start or stop songs, or the commercial interests of their radio station.

I've also seen the distinction made between "system games" and "non-system games", often with strong opinions as to which is better, or which is more "real" roleplaying. For purposes of this discussion, I think that the non-system games that are played in this fashion fall well under the umbrella of the term "freeform".<br/><br/>Short larp games, of the sort that are showcased at the Intercon conventions, for example, run the gamut from completely systemless to fairly heavy rules &amp; randomizers. So there's a subset there that could fairly be termed freeform. I don't think the term gets used much in that context, though I don't know if there's an alternate one. Scenarios are either structured so that conflicts are unnecessary, or conflicts get resolved by mutual agreement and/or GM decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322057/#Comment_322057" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-28T08:44:36+00:00" title="April 28, 2011  8:44AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone played anthropologist and done outside observation without participating in a game that could be described as freeform (in whatever manner)?<br/><br/>I know it's a little hard because we all come from some sort of hobbyist background, but I'm kinda interested in all of the undocumented methods/procedures/etc that surround this type of play, and it's something hard to see while I'm doing it.<br/><br/>For example, I'd hazard a guess that in the case Dae H describes, there's a whole lot more going on than just the mechanic he describes of roll  d% and GM interprets results.

OF COURSE there were a whole bunch of procedures and methods involved.  There were character creation rules. There was a "training" program for folks new to the game. There were methods for resolving things that were contradictory.  There were methods for resolving cross-posting. There were methods to resolve what happened when a player dropped out, joined, or wasn't heard from in a long while.  In fact, I just found <a href="http://www.io.com/~lcowper/InNomine/symphony.html" rel="nofollow">the rules that we used</a>, check them out.<br/><br/>Freeform traditions are sets of specific practices, not derived from some Platonic ideal based on what the word might be imagined to mean. That is, I think, what Emily's trying to get at in this thread.  You can't understand or define freeform just by thinking about it (is that true of roleplaying?), you have to actually interact with and learn from the folks that are doing it.<br/><br/>That said, you can also write freeform methods and mechanics for a tradition that doesn't exist yet, deriving ideas from existing traditions. A bunch of my games have tried to do that: <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2010/05/01/ghost-opera-mechanics-in-brief/" rel="nofollow">Ghost Opera</a>, <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/due-vigilance-new-24-hour-game/" rel="nofollow">Due Vigilance</a>, <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2006/01/18/kazekami-kyoko-kills-kublai-khan/" rel="nofollow">Killing Kublai Khan</a>, etc. None of these have developed into new design or play traditions yet, but that's hard to do.

For this area/type/style of what folks call freeform. But your game seems like a game that is mostly freeform, with an ultra-light non-freeform guidance system for the GM. Reminds me of several mostly freeform games I've been involved in. Free form seems to refer more to the mechanical system, rather than the distribution of gm authority etc. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Has anyone played anthropologist and done outside observation without participating in a game that could be described as freeform (in whatever manner)?<br/><br/>I know it's a little hard because we all come from some sort of hobbyist background, but I'm kinda interested in all of the undocumented methods/procedures/etc that surround this type of play, and it's something hard to see while I'm doing it.<br/><br/>For example, I'd hazard a guess that in the case Dae H describes, there's a whole lot more going on than just the mechanic he describes of roll  d% and GM interprets results.

I've done a very basic observation of freeform play that some friends did back in 2006 <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=50" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'd love to have the opportunity to do more, better.

Randomizers are not the only type of system.<br/><br/>There are many system-heavy larps that never use a single "randomizer". Nothing is determined by chance. The three other limiters most often used are:<br/><br/>Real action - if you touch someone successfully with your boffer sword, you do damage, for example. If you manually disarm a trap without triggering the cap explosion, then you have disarmed it. The action can be allegorical, like a foam sword hit standing in for a real weapon strike, but the action that determines success is real, not determined by rolling dice or drawing cards or pulling beads or whatever. Extremely allegorical actions, like the shuffleboard combat used by <a href="http://truedungeon.com/" rel="nofollow">True Dungeon</a>, could be considered a gray area between a randomizer and "real action" resolution.<br/><br/>Time - Time is used in lots of ways. Activation times, where you have to speak a 5 second incantation before activating a spell, for example, or where you have to pretend to polish armor for 1 minute to return a point of defense. Duration time, where a sleep spell lasts 1 minute. Recovery time, where you get spell points back when you rest for 1 hour between fights. All time-based mechanics.<br/><br/>Economy - This could be money, but it could be any other sort of tradeable resource. If you have it, you can do something with it. If you're out, you can't. Even single unique items fall into this category. The character who is holding it can make use of whatever is special about it and others cannot.<br/><br/>And those elements combine together in lots of ways. Well, not that many, cause there's only 3 of them. But they can be flavored in different ways. So you get many iterations.<br/><br/>You can have a very system-heavy game that way. A game that is far from what would generally be called freeform.<br/><br/>I've seen games that were considered freeform but had some elements of these things. Like some items to trade, for example. Or maybe a physical puzzle to complete. Some things to focus play and structure goals a little, without imposing a bunch of systemic conflict resolution onto the game.<br/><br/>For example, I played a Cthulhu larp where the players each started with 1-2 items, and there were a few more hidden throuout the play space to be found. Those items revealed secrets about certain characters or provided clues about the mysteries. But the game had no other mechanics, as I recall. And the "power" that the items held was primarily social, though there was much to be said for hiding damning evidence about oneself, for example.<br/><br/>I think that the most significant thing that freeform games don't have is stats - mechanics that are directly attached to a character that are intended to mechanically differentiate one from another.

There is one in the vacinity - Enigma Live Game Labs <a href="http://www.livegamelabs.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.livegamelabs.com/</a> which grew out of the UCLA game club. But I've only done a couple things with them. Having found that group makes me wish I'd gone to UCLA instead of UCIrvine.<br/><br/>Mostly I just played some random one-shot larps at conventions, some of which were systemless enough that the freeform label suits them. But they weren't "sold" as "freeform" games.<br/><br/>Most of them were just systemless intrigue-focused larps. But I got pretty burnt out on those, because the main interaction seemed to be "try to convince people to share the secrets we wrote on their character sheet, which they probably shouldn't share with you, so they most likely won't, and even if they do, there's a 50% chance that anything they tell you is a lie anyway." So they just became exercises in futility and frustration. I'd listen to the post-game wrap up and realize that I'd only gotten about 10% of the information I needed after 3 hours of doing my best convincing.<br/><br/>The games had an unfortunate combination. You had a set of goals to try to accomplish, most of which amounted to trading information. But because you were just trading words, players could lie all they wanted to. So people would spread false information and horde their real info.<br/><br/>I had much more fun playing an actual trading game a couple years ago. Everyone started with 3 cards, with a label on one side (like "bag of shells") and on the other side was a detailed description. The reason for the split was that some of the things you were looking for required you to read the detailed description in order to figure out that's what you needed. For example, my character wanted some small blue objects to decorate his room with. It turned out when I read the description that the shells were blue, so they met my goal. Another neat thing was that I just had to have the object, show it to the GM, and then my goal was met and I could circulate the item back in (basically, I took a few of the shells but didn't need the whole bag). So the same object could satisfy goals for more than one player.<br/><br/>It was an exceptionally fun game for me, because the goals were so much more tangible. And the timing turned out to be perfect. Our third and hardest goal was shared with a group. 2 of the 4 groups finished their big goals, and both were in the last 10 minutes of play time. About 4 of the 18 players finished all of their goals, but most people finished 2 of their 3.<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure I'd consider the game a freeform game. It had a trading mechanic driving most of the game, rather than just storytelling and imagination. And I think a couple of the players didn't enjoy it as much because of that. One of the people on my team wanted to focus on having dramatic arguments with one of the other characters and decided she didn't want to trade. Fortunately, there was also a very lighweight resolution mechanic that could be used to steal items, which prevented her from completely stymieing the game for the people who needed the items she had and wouldn't trade, even for the things her goals said she wanted.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I'm not sure whether I'd call that game freeform or not. But I enjoyed it a lot more than the freeform sleuthing games I played.<br/><br/>I also played some funky wacky freeform convention larps run by jim pinto. They were always called Mystery LARP, and the mystery was that you never knew what the game was going to be like. Some of them he came up with while driving to the con. One of the games, the only "mechanic" was a stack of nametags - a couple times during the game, the GM would write something on a name tag and attach it to you, and now that was part of you. Those fit the "freeform" label even better. They were funky experimental experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322100/#Comment_322100" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-28T15:18:13+00:00" title="April 28, 2011  3:18PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Can you break out some examples of, say, starting up an online RP.

This thread should be, like, 7 threads.<br/><br/>As for ATF, I'll just say that, in my experience, it's characterized by valuing (a) the judgment of one or more participants to smoothly and satisfyingly resolve outcomes above (b) the structure of formal systems.  This value statement often goes hand in hand with a desire to treat the fiction as the primary agent in play.  (Hi, immersionists!)  In such groups, task resolution mechanics often fade from authoritative to mere suggestions that the GM can choose to ignore.  Some groups continue to roll the dice as a ritual signal for "I want you to tell me the outcome -- now!"  Others spend most of play not bothering with that, and thus become freeform.  <br/><br/>Most of the American tabletop players I've known did not get into RPGs to scratch their "play a game" itch, but rather to achieve a sense of transportation into an alternate reality where they are more badass or important or adventurous than in real life.  Accordingly, the above priority (verisimilitude over structure) has been common, and freeform play likewise.  This is why "trad games", though poor mechanisms by game design standards, are not "broken" -- they give inspiration and tools to the not-quite-a-game that their players are actually looking for.

There is no "community" for it, but diverse players romping around with freeform gameplay quite often. I really like that loose, impromptu aspect of it.<br/><br/>There's also been a bit of "freeform" forum and postal gameplay going on from time to time. Most of it has been moderately successful, maybe due to these games depending on a stretched out arc of concentration from the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322120/#Comment_322120" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-28T17:10:13+00:00" title="April 28, 2011  5:10PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Oh man.

This thread should be, like, 7 threads.</blockquote>\nIn my mind, which may or may not be reflective of how others feel, freeform tabletop and freeform larp are much closer to being the same thing than, say, D&amp;D vs boffer fantasy larp or even tabletop Vampire the Whatever vs Vampire larp. <br/><br/>Especially when you have something like jeepform, which came out of Nordic larping, but purposely eschews many of the features of the larp medium, like props, costumes, and simultaneous action. It ends up becoming more like tabletop freeform, but with some occasional movement around the room and a little more doing and less describing.<br/><br/>Another tradition that may be worthy of putting on the list - blackbox larping. Here's the best description that I know of: <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/archive/index.php/t-340968.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/archive/index.php/t-340968.html</a><br/><br/>Basically, it's larp meets blackbox improv theatre. No set dressing, no props, no costumes. There is 1 or more stage areas, which act as a location - the current location for the stage is marked with a post-it note. When not on stage being one's character, one is audience for whichever stage one wants to watch. Generally, players are encouraged to use their OOC audience perspective to interject themselves into scenes where it would be interesting and appropriate for them to appear. Funky stuff. And I think it meets the criteria that most would use for the term freeform, though it's a rather specific flavor thereof.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322121/#Comment_322121" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-28T17:12:16+00:00" title="April 28, 2011  5:12PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I think about freeform games, I like to differentiate between the idea of mechanics and procedures.

The description sounds awful and damning, but honestly, I really kinda dig it and wish I could come up with a nicer, more positive description of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_322157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322157/#Comment_322157" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-28T23:22:53+00:00" title="April 28, 2011 11:22PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Verbal Costume</blockquote>I dig that one!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322180/#Comment_322180" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T06:02:25+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  6:02AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to be slow responding - been away for a bit. Yes, Bob is of course right that my description of freeform play leaves unwritten rules undescribed. The "community of play" in question was playing BRP-based games such as CoC in the UK, in the late 80s and early 90s, and finding that the less of the rules as written we used, the better it worked for us, until the percentile roll was almost the only thing left. <br/><br/>And yes, what Dave Berg said, even if we weren't Americans! That was pretty much it. Simpler mechanics for more sense of immersion in a fictional world, and less having to deal with anomalous rules results that nobody liked that much anyway, such as facing down Azathoth and only taking a 2 point SAN loss or failing your Library use roll and having to come back on consecutive days until you succeeded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322255/#Comment_322255" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T11:02:31+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 11:02AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>There's a lot of interest in talking generally about what freeform means, so I started a<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14200" rel="nofollow">new thread</a>for that discussion.<br/><br/>I've never heard of black box larping before. Sounds like the kind of approach to set and prop that jeep takes, with a more free flowing approach to plot and scene. Where does the black box image come from, or is that a historical artifact?</blockquote>\nBlackbox larp comes out of black box theater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box_theater" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box_theater</a>, and has similar goals.<br/><br/>To reduce the emphasis on technical aspects - costuming, set design, location, props (and game mechanics) - in order to focus on story and emotion. Imagineering instead of engineering, say.<br/><br/>It is one of the few forms of "game" roleplay to make use of the standard theater audience position. People are specifically not "in play" when they are not on a stage space. Which is interesting and unusual.<br/><br/>I'd say that the most common other occurance of using the theater-style audience position in roleplay is in training and therapy roleplay - for example, two employees are performing a roleplay exercise while the trainer and remaining employees are watching, and then they all discuss afterward.
