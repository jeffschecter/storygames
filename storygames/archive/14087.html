They're vicious and quite angry. I tried to reason with some at first, but they charged through my front door and attempted to grab me.<br/><br/>I fled to the basement. It doesn't have any windows or exterior access, which means that the only entrance is through the thick wooden door at the top of the wooden stairs. I can hear those ferocious creatures skittering about through my house, occasionally trying to gnaw their way through the door before getting distracted. I barricaded it with everything I could find - spare lumber, an ironing board, a few cinder blocks. It's obviously not much.<br/><br/>Here's what I have: my iPhone (on which I'm typing this), the washer &amp; dryer (as well as all the laundry room supplies you'd expect), a dry cellar containing some canned goods and some spare mason jars, a table saw and some basic construction tools, spare lumber, cinder blocks, an assortment of industrial strength cleaners, several feet of spare PVC piping, three sleeping bags, a tent, a tarp, and my little sister's ballet gear (my family ran out of storage space and asked me to store it here).<br/><br/>My fiancee Kaleigh just called me. She saw the rat-people and fled into the bedroom. She locked herself inside of an old-fashioned treasure chest-style trunk, because she didn't think she'd be safe in the closet. Not the best choice, but what's done is done. She said the rats are trying to claw and chew their way through the chest, but haven't managed much purchase yet. They also tried to pick it up, maybe to toss it down the stairs or something gruesome like that. But the only managed to tip it sideways - meaning they must be relatively weak. She's worried they'll chew through, or that she'll run out of oxygen if they don't. In the chest with her is her cell phone, several blouses, and a ziploc baggie full of narcotics that I'm not supposed to tell anyone about.<br/><br/>Things are dire. I saw them tear one of my neighbours in two, before they charged my house. Me and Kaleigh don't have much time. I don't know where I found the time to make this detailed post. Help!<br/><br/>What should we do?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318787/#Comment_318787" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T22:23:41+00:00" title="April  4, 2011 10:23PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>I tried to reason with some at first</blockquote>\nShit, man...that was your first mistake. Rat-men tend to see attempts at communication as begging and therefore a sign of weakness. This was clearly a signal that you were easy pickings and thus their attack is relentless.<br/><br/>It may not be too late, though. If you can seize the upper hand with a fearsome show of force, It's possible you can rout them. offhand, I'd say your best bet would be to make grenades by pouring industrial cleaners in Mason jars; the shock and awe of glass shrapnel and caustic chemical spray should scatter them. Stripping naked and smearing yourself with makeshift warpaint wouldn't hurt either, Be sure to howl like a madman!<br/><br/>If you can't reach kaleigh in time, you should have her sieze the initiative in a similar fashion. Bursting out of the trunk raving like a Goddess of Death will be the last thing they expect. And she's got narcotics on hand to put her in the right frame of mind; frankly I rate her chances at better than yours!<br/><br/>Hurry!

I would add - put the tarp down on the stairs before you do anything, to make it easier to clean up later. Keep the hammer that is among your basic construction tools handy, so you can take out any ratmen who aren't intimidated by the industrial chemical grenades. You may be tempted to use the claw end of the hammer - do not - you'll take out one ratman, sure, but then the claw will be stuck in his skull, and the next ratman will be on you. <br/><br/>But what kind of narcotics in the chest?

Use the other tools to make the table-saw more mobile. You might want to keep the table-top on it for a shield, or not. The extension cords should let you attack every rat-thing in your house, unless they outflank you and chew the cord. Hope they are not so smart, but keep the crowbar for back-up.<br/><br/>If the narcotics is heroin, tell Kamandi... I mean Kaleigh she can blow it through the gaps when they start chewing through the chest, and they will probably fuck off. If it's coke, though? Probably better to save it for herself when she has to fight hand-to-hand with these fuckers.

The first one could catch my house on fire, which might make it really hard to rescue Kaleigh from upstairs and fight my way back out of the house. The second sounds really difficult. I'll be frank: I'm weak, and this saw is huge.<br/><br/>Is there any easier way?<br/><br/>...you know, now that I pause for a moment, I don't hear any noise coming from upstairs.

So, I'll just hit a few salient points:<br/><br/>Ratman agression is typically short lived.  If you can rout or wait out the Ratmen, I believe you will be safe.  The first few hours are vital to your survival.<br/><br/>Ratmen with an impaired sense of smell, in most cases, will not attack.  Find a way to deaden their senses and you are one step closer.  Zinc Sulfate, as found in fertilizers is a good choice.  <br/><br/>Ratmen are effectively colorblind and have blurry vision at best.  Extreme light will give them pause in their attack, so turn on all lights and keep any flashlights close to shine them.  For god's sake, do not turn off the lights!  They already know you are there.<br/><br/>Ratmen are hard wired to be susceptible to attacks to their rear.  Though they are not fatal, a wound to the rear is often more effective than a fatal wound to the chest or head.  Ratmen typically fight among themselves until one has taken a bite on the other's rump at which time the wounded submits and the victor asserts his domiance.  <br/><br/>Finally, Ratmen are highly motivated by avoidance behaviors and once they have sumbitted in an area will not likely return.<br/><br/>So, my suggestion is to blow some fertilizer (if you have some) or alternatively some laundry detergent through the PVC pipes at the attacking Ratmen.  If you can rout them from a room, it is likely safe to assume you have won that room back (due to classic avoidance behavior).  If some sneak past the fertlizer or detergent then try to blind them and smack, punch or stab them in the rear.  This will send them running for easier prey.<br/><br/>Good luck.  I've only had to do this once and while I was mostly successful, I really hate typing with one hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318806/#Comment_318806" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-05T01:04:55+00:00" title="April  5, 2011  1:04AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2011 1:08AM by Mcdaldno.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wightbred</cite>Also give us as much intel on the rat men as you can.</blockquote>\nThey were mangy, dressed in dirty orange robes/rags. Like, a little bit less bright than the colour of a buddhist monk's robes, but all dirty and torn up.<br/><br/>I only got a good look at the one that lunged at me while I was in the doorway, because obviously after that I turned and bolted into the basement. He had this weird disfigured face - the mouth was like a gaping hole that twisted up his snout and cheek. Like, imagine a cleft palate on a snout, I guess, but all his gums and teeth were exposed. I didn't get a good look at anything else; that snarling mouth held my gaze until I turned and ran.<br/><br/>They're about four to five feet tall, I would guess? One had a hammer or something, and it used it to smash in my car windshield. That's when I started trying to reason with them. I think I saw another with some kind of chain thing. It looked like an unwieldy flail, maybe.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wightbred</cite>I'd say as a second step you need to fortify or move to a better location. Is there a car outside and a safer location you can move too? Where are the keys?</blockquote>\nThe car will be no use, since the bridge is out. I mean, we can go to a couple neighbour's places, or up to the reservoir... but it's probably quicker and safer to just run through the woods to get there. I don't know what the safest place would be, really. There's a water tower up by the reservoir, which might be defensible if it isn't already occupied. Or we could try to find a quiet spot in the woods to hide, and just pray that they don't find our scent. This house isn't great as far as defenses go - mostly built of wood, with lots of windows. There are other neighbourhood houses that might be better. One neighbour has a modernist cement-square style of home, but they don't like us very much and they're super secluded.<br/><br/>Any thoughts? Where should we go, if we get out?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Erik_Battle</cite><br/>Ratman agression is typically short lived. If you can rout or wait out the Ratmen, I believe you will be safe.

I'm going with the jar grenade weaponry, and the burning chemicals are probably going to drive them out of the area and keep them out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>I'm telling you, man, naked and ululating is the only way to go. Don't come crying to me when all these clever power-tool antics get you maimed, then gnawed to death.</blockquote>\nOkay, so... I'm not running around naked, because there's still over a foot of snow on the ground out there, and last time I checked, it was hovering around 0 (celsius). But the molotov weaponry idea seems the most functional, with a hammer as a handy back-up tool. There's plenty of spare clothing in the dryer to fashion a wick out of.<br/><br/>So, there's no noise coming from upstairs, but I'm going to try to play it safe anyways. I'll un-barricade the door, ready a jar grenade, wait a minute... if I don't hear anything, press forward and do some recon.<br/><br/>Wish me luck, people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318808/#Comment_318808" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-05T02:52:58+00:00" title="April  5, 2011  2:52AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you fucking kidding me?

Did you get bitten?<br/><br/>If you need to go now, my gut says watertower. But you're on the ground so if you have some time to think here are some issues to consider:<br/>- Defensible position and take a weapon<br/>- Somewhere you can see their movements<br/>- Mobile reception<br/>- Power for lights and to recharge your phone (take your charger)<br/>- Water and food (take some with you)<br/>- Warmth<br/>- Hygiene and a WC<br/>- Something to keep up morale<br/>- Team up with others if possible, but watch for possible infection<br/>- What else have I forgotten?<br/><br/>So I think it has to be the watertower or your concrete modern neighbors. Adversity may bring you together. Take the car, check your reception with them and head for the watertower if it is not positive.

It's not looking too good for Joe. I'm guessing that charge didn't go so well.</blockquote>\nSo, I managed to get out of the basement, no problem. I saw a few rat-man corpses littering my kitchen, and got really confused. Had the rabbit men that Lula sent been in my house? Was this the result of a rescue mission? Upon further inspection, it looks like there was some kind of disagreement between the rat-men, and this is how it got settled. Why would they kill some of their own, and then just take off?<br/><br/>Either way, I got to the trunk just in time. Kaleigh was running out of oxygen, and yeah: she'd managed to somehow actually lock herself into this airtight trunk. Like I said: not the best response to a crisis. When the rat-men were smashing at the trunk and flipping it onto its side, she'd assumed that she was dead either way, and so she tried to OD on that baggie of coke that we had lying in our trunk.<br/><br/>So, right: the rat-men killed some of their own, the rest didn't seem to be around, and Kaleigh's pupils looked like david and goliath. We grabbed our first aid kit, and a bulk box of granola bars, and her purse... and made our way out to the car to see if it was a viable transportation option. At about the same time that I realized they'd busted up the thing beyond repair, Kaleigh started sneezing blood onto the dashboard. Things were not looking good for her.<br/><br/>We got back out of the car, and I saw a bunch of rat-people on their way back over, carrying torches. I knew that the house was no longer a safe place. We grabbed the first aid kit, and I stuffed a handful of granola bars into my hoodie, and I grabbed a couple items from the car: Kaleigh's purse, the snow scraper (closest thing to a weapon that I saw), a half-full jug of windshield wiper fluid (in case we need to manufacture more chemical weapons). And we took off, into the woods.<br/><br/>We're currently hiding out in a neighbour's chicken coop. The chickens were all slaughtered when we got here, meaning that the rat-men have already swept this building once. Do you guys think they'll return for the meat, or is this a safe place? The neighbours also have a shed, but it's padlocked and has no windows - any ideas there?<br/><br/>The water tower is about a 200 meter shot through the woods, and as far as I've seen it looks like a pretty safe route... but at the moment, Kaleigh's dealing with an OD. My phone's all fucked up. It'll let me refresh this page, but it won't let me switch over to a new one, or access any other sites. So... you guys will have to tell me what to do.<br/><br/>I'm hiding out in a chicken coop, my fiancee is ODing on coke, and rat-men are marauding through the woods.

Anyways, it's here. I should be able to smash the lock on the shed, and get in. However, looking through the cracks between the wall slats in here, I am noticing that there are a couple rat-men wandering through this neck of the woods. I don't want to raise the alarm... Is there some way to get into the shed without raising an alarm? Or possibly to start with a diversion so they won't notice me? I dunno, I think I need a better plan.<br/><br/>Also: the chicken coop is lit with a red heat lamp, obviously, and there is a great deal of straw in here. While unhygenic as fuck, it's pretty toasty warm in here. The blood is starting to creep me out, though.

However, I just checked it out, and I'm not sure what to do with it exactly: we ordered it for cheap off eBay, and I'm just realizing now that all the labels and instructions are in, like, Chinese or Japanese or something.

Three or four of them came at me, all at once. Kaleigh managed to fend one off (pretty good considering her state), and I took a couple out with the hammer... but one bit me. The snow around the shed is now blood-soaked, so it's not a very cunning hiding place. We retreated into the covered cab of the neighbor's truck, and are hiding in there. It's dark and cold, but it's safe for the moment.<br/><br/>I'm bit real bad, in my left arm (which is my dominant arm). Kaleigh's recovering at a surprisingly quick rate, which is nice, but now I'm in deep trouble. I'm worried that these things might be infectious, that I might turn into a were-rat. Any easy way to tell if I'm at risk of lycanthropy?<br/><br/>Also, on the way from the coop to the shed, I saw some prints in the snow that looked like giant rabbit prints.

I think I saw a glimpse of some Rabbit Men just now, but your advice was in my head and I just ducked and hid from them. They went their way, I went mine, and it's probably a good thing that I didn't try to flag them down.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Joe: Consume the heart of the rat-thing that bit you, raw.</blockquote>\nJohnstone, I didn't think I could do it at first. It smelled like... well, have you ever accidentally left raw meat out on your counter for like a month or two? It smelled like that. But I ate it, nonetheless. I immediately felt different. Powerful. Resolved. And then, after that, any rat-men I saw craned their neck, sniffed the air between us, and darted away. News spread quickly through their ranks, it would seem, because they're all gone from this area.<br/><br/>When I returned to the house, I found it burnt to the ground (as foreshadowed by the torch mob, earlier). But me and Kaleigh are both alive and... alive. So, I call that a win. We're going to trek out way down to the town (by foot), and seek some permanent shelter there.<br/><br/>Thanks everybody, for helping me through this crisis.
