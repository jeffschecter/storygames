But I saw some subtle differences.<br/><br/>We were playing the (unpublished) JFK assassination playset, and five players easily allowed us to have several subplots going on at once. I was running it in a four-hour con slot and accommodating an extra player. So I just made sure each scene was a little quicker, and the pacing was fine.<br/><br/>I suspect that three players will be less of a slow burn at first, since there will be no characters at the table who do not have a direct connection to each other. And perhaps more usage of NPCs and more time to stretch out scenes if you like.<br/><br/>Either way sounds fun to me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278521/#Comment_278521" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T10:30:57+00:00" title="June 29, 2010 10:30AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2010 10:32AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Fear the Deuteronomy Kid! </i><br/><br/>(cross-posted with Chris)<br/><br/>A three player game played straight goes by really fast - 12 scenes. That can be super fun! You cannot screw around. It can also be too tight to really dig into the situation if you are a bunch of lollygaggers..<br/><br/>A five player game goes slow (by Fiasco standards), with the added wrinkle of two characters who are not directly involved with your dude at the start instead of zero (three player) or one (four player). That can also be fun, or it can drag if you play with knuckleheads.<br/><br/>You can slow down a three player game or speed up a five player game by adjusting the available dice at the start of play (see page 52).<br/><br/>So it is really a matter of preference, and the game rocks with 3,4 or 5. I facilitate 20-die five player games all the time and it is fine - you just need to be on top of things and maybe edit more aggressively than normal.<br/><br/>Also: The Kennedy assassination (written by Chris Bennett) will be playset of the month in October.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278538/#Comment_278538" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T11:11:31+00:00" title="June 29, 2010 11:11AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A 3 player game with strangers can feel abrupt.

I actually like the fact that subplots are so costly to introduce in a 12-scene game, and that the end is always too close - I love the intensity, and the high narrative velocity, that that entails. I also like sessions under two hours, and I've only been able to do that with three at the table.<br/><br/>None of the foregoing should be read as disagreeing with the nice things people have said about larger games, because four- or five-player Fiasco is definitely fun. But Jason's advice, that it gets more important that you get rigorous about editing scenes as you add players, accords 100% with my play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278550/#Comment_278550" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T12:01:42+00:00" title="June 29, 2010 12:01PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in two games with three players at GPNW.<br/><br/>One of the big differences for me is that there's less raw material on the table at the start.  This means that every Relationship or Detail has to count, and that the discussion between the setup and the first scene has to really bear fruit.  With more people, you can dive into the first scene and just explore: "hm, a Klingon sword, let's push that button and see what happens."  And it's not a real problem, because there are plenty of Relationships and Details and so if you don't get to some, it's not a big problem.  With fewer things on the table, there's less inspiration for the first few scenes.<br/><br/>Also, our first game in the session was kind of rocky and didn't really take off, while the second one had caught on fire by the second scene.  I don't know exactly why, but I think there are at least two possibly contributing factors.  One was the playset: we played "Boomtown" first, and I think that had the problem that we weren't quite sure what genre we were in.  The western genre is pretty expansive - it covers "A Fistful of Dollars," "Unforgiven," and "Blazing Saddles" - and one of the things that I think is key in freeform games is to make sure everyone is on the same page as far as genre goes.  (The game was never *terrible* - it was just that when the same set of us played the second game, based on the "Main Street" playset, and things took off like a rocket jet, the problems with the first game were obvious in retrospect.)  The other was inexperience - we spent a lot of time talking about Rules and What To Do in the first game, while by the second game the mechanics had become pretty transparent.  <br/><br/>So if you have three, I'd say to make sure you've established precisely what genre you're playing in and that you each have a solid scene idea by the time you're done the discussion phase that happens between the setup and the first scene.  If you have five, be prepared to be aggressive, or for the game to take longer, and think of interesting subplots that can be resolved in 4-5 scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278556/#Comment_278556" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T12:33:59+00:00" title="June 29, 2010 12:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            another vote for 5 over 3 for all the reasons posted above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278637/#Comment_278637" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T17:58:41+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  5:58PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charlton, if you have a group that wants to use Boomtown to play Blazing Saddles, please post their lat/long/elevation. I will be there shortly and with bells on. All the way on.<br/><br/>Your point about having to know what the Klingon sword's story is in the setup is something I forgot to mention as a feature of 3P Fiasco. When we had incriminating photos in one of our games and didn't at least outline what they were, we wound up forgetting about them entirely. Fortunately our Need and Location more than picked up the slack, and everyone was still tied up in a well-developed detail. Anyway, I see that as (like I said) more of a feature than a bug.

You don't need to nail it all down in the setup, because that last element's utility will usually become glaringly obvious once you start to mess with the other four. There's enough stuff on the table it can start to feel like playing before you play. So if you've got "Object: Love letter", it is totally OK to leave that alone and see what turns up in the first half dozen scenes rather than defining who wrote it to whom, provided everything other element is kicking.<br/><br/>Not so with three or four players generally.<br/><br/>It is gratifying to see the differences in taste and opinion here. I really tried hard to make Fiasco a game you would integrate into your own culture of play rather than bend to accommodate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278738/#Comment_278738" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T08:41:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  8:41AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin, I think playing Blazing Saddles with Boomtown would work amazingly well.  It's just that if one player is playing Blazing Saddles, one player is playing Unforgiven, one player is playing A Fistful of Dollars... it doesn't work so well.  I might pitch it at a Story Games Boston game night, if I can clear up my Wednesday schedule....<br/><br/>Figuring things out ahead of time can be a bug or a feature -- it's too context-dependent.  In five-player games, I've had a lot of success just figuring out what the relationships are and leaving *all* the Details to be worked out in play.

Probably.  Part of the reason it never came up was because we had more than enough to work with without it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278816/#Comment_278816" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T12:16:13+00:00" title="June 30, 2010 12:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>Colin, I think playing Blazing Saddles with Boomtown would work amazingly well.</blockquote> I want that to be true very badly, and just have to find the group that agrees with me. Your point about genre-convention clash is certainly well-taken. I can't help but suspect that this notional guy who expects Blazing Saddles when the filmography mentions (e.g.) The Proposition is just being contrary. But even the Fistful/Unforgiven divide (which still encapsulates the structuralist/postmodern divide in microcosm) is a wide one, for sure.<br/><br/>Oh, another suggestion for three players: Go formula. Fistful, not Unforgiven - by the numbers, rather than commenting on them. No one loves a good meta more than I do... well, that's not true, those Monty Python guys rather liked meta. And also Foucault. Come to think of it, maybe I've mined this Monty Python thing so deep that I'm coming out the other side. But if you want to really get an exhilarating pace out of your small game, you need to have a laser focus on doing the most obvious thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278821/#Comment_278821" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T12:33:55+00:00" title="June 30, 2010 12:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>Also: The Kennedy assassination (written by Chris Bennett) will be playset of the month in October.</blockquote>\nOut of curiosity, how far ahead do you have these playsets planned?
