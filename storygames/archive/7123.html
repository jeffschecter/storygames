I launched the game at Games Expo at the end of May and the units have gone to the following places.<br/><br/>Comps = 5<br/>Retail sales = 50<br/>Direct Sales = 44<br/>Faulty = 1<br/><br/>The one faulty copy got bashed up a bit on the way to me from the states, but I am hoping Ryan might add an extra one to a future run, still need to chat to him about that.<br/><br/>Breaking things down further<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Retail</span> This are all UK stores, Black Lion is my local shop.<br/><br/>Black Lion = 18<br/>Leisure Games = 16<br/>Eclectic = 10<br/>Ecollectica = 6<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Direct</span><br/><br/>Games Expo = 30<br/>Post GE = 11<br/><br/>At the moment the site is doing diddly squat for me, I have not had a single direct sale. I am toying with removing the charge for P&amp;P. Partly I think this is down to me not marketing the game as much as I should have after expo but work has been a little draining the last month or so. I will be a lot more active in the coming months.<br/><br/>The second run is split as follows:<br/><br/>45, including 5 comp, to IPR<br/>55 to me.<br/><br/>I am aslo looking to Esdevium with the second run to see if they will distribute for me, but I have no idea of the cut they will take.<br/><br/>After the initial run, payment for art and payment for the second run I am sitting at close to \xa3300 in my account so not doing too badly at all. Looks like short run card games can turn money fairly quickly for those interested in pursuing that route.<br/><br/>Hope this is helpful to people<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158442/#Comment_158442" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T17:15:37+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  5:15PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very helpful, thanks.

There are 63 cards per deck presented with a black and white rules sheet in a custom tuck box. Each unit costs about \xa32.50 including shipping. The second run has been a few pence more expensive as I had to get the ipr stock assembled stateside. The second run will see me distributing through 2nd parties more so I will update people as I learn more about how that is going to work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158522/#Comment_158522" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T06:34:07+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  6:34AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

The Collective Endeavour stand is primarily known for RPGs, B-Movie was the first card game we would have. And to Iains credit, it went very well. The sales figures at games Expo were exceptional. This was helped in no small part by the ease of demoing it: sit down, hand out cards, play until someone has created a full film, stop, sell film, end demo and get that sale!<br/><br/>The \xa39 price was also very attractive to customers. The cheerful, colourful nature of the cards themselves got people looking at them. Anecdotally, kids were also really keen on the game. Even though the idea of a b-movie might not be familiar to them, they found it fun to create amusing film titles, especially with their parents. <br/><br/>Iain has certainly shown that doing a card game in this way is viable. All kudos to him.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
