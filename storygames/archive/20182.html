(Belmont being, obviously, one of the options.) Unlike zodiacs, two characters could share a bloodline, in which case one would be the primary inheritor of the clan, while others would be secondary (and in some sense expendable) members of the tradition.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a pretty natural palette swap for the game. A very nice change of pace when you've played the original so much that you've temporarily had your fill of tengus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445275/#Comment_445275" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-19T15:38:10+00:00" title="May 19, 2015  3:38PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really cool! I'm glad we are on the same wave-length.<br/><br/>In my head, the Castle is a living breathing creature of Chaos. So even if a player character is doing the work of Dracula or Death or whatever, the Castle can oppose them on their rolls (because... Chaos).<br/><br/>I did four character types, "Demon Hunter", "Treasure Hunter", "Belmont", and "Other..."<br/>The starting Trust is pretty lop-sided, so even if you are an Ally with one type, they may not be Ally with you. It helps spice things up, and that initial mismatch evens out in later chapter.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why the files I have would not open for you. I can try to download them on my end and see what's what. Do you still have any notes on your hack? I would love to host them on my page as well, if you are interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445276/#Comment_445276" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-19T15:41:40+00:00" title="May 19, 2015  3:41PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like I'm getting an error if I click on the file name on the page, and then try do download it from the next prompt.<br/><br/>I can download the file if I click the "down arrow" that's to the right of the page, in the same row as the file name.
