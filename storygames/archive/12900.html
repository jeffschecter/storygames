In that piece, a pianist said that he had gravitated towards Monk among other choices because an artist of his caliber "offered an infinite number of responses".  Now I don't know anything about jazz piano, but I do know that I have felt that way about some games that I've played, that after playing them I felt like I was in a dialog with the game, and I felt compelled to respond.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was wondering if others had felt that way, what the game was, the message they received, and how they responded?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTyler                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
