I like Ron a lot! But his writing is rather dry. And yet, this essay held me captive, it's very interesting. It also answers questions <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> above for me:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/9/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/9/</a><br/><br/>I really think it's a must-read to really answer that question.<br/><br/>1) I think of a few games that came out in the 90s that were <b>Exactly like AD&amp;D</b> (usually 1st edition) with a few minor/cool changes, but their authors never read/played other games in order to make them any more unique than that 1-2 thing that appeared in them.<br/><br/>2) Eh, sort of? It is not a dismissal of the games outright (like a snort, shrug, and "pffft, <i>heartbreaker</i>"). It's only a heartbreaker if it really does break your heart to some degree: "Jeesus, this one thing is AWESOME! Man, why did they have to put that one awesome thing in a totally forgettable AD&amp;D clone?" It recognizes that each of those games had something awesome in it, but the game was utterly forgotten because it was too much like AD&amp;D to find an audience.<br/><br/>3) Here's the games I think of!<br/><br/>Fifth Cycle - 1990, Shield Laminating, by Robert Bartels <br/>Hahlmabrea - 1991, Sutton Hoo Games, by Dan Fox. <br/>Of Gods and Men - 1991, Non Sequitur Productions, by Jeffrey Konkol <br/>Darkurthe: Legends - 1993, Black Dragon Press, by Matthew Yaro and Colin Murcray <br/>Legendary Lives - 1993, Marquee Press, by Kathleen and Joe Williams <br/>Neverworld - 1996, Foreverworld Books, by Erin Laughlin <br/>Pelicar - 1996, Pharoah Games, by Lewis Nicolls (one of six listed authors, possibly the primary) <br/>Forge: Out of Chaos - 1998, Basement Games Unlimited, by Mike, Paul, and Mark Kibbe <br/>Dawnfire - 2000, Dawnfire Games/ Committed Comics, by Jason Marin <br/><br/>The one that I particularly remember, though, is "Imagine: Role-Playing" ( <a href="http://www.role-playing.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.role-playing.com/</a> ). It came out in the very late nineties, and was pretty much exactly like AD&amp;D 1st edition with a few rules tweaks. Giant-ass gorgeous books, volumous and well-illustrated. Utterly, utterly forgettable in every way save for... crap, it's been like 14 years... um, IIRC they had a list and description of a bunch of herbs that you could find if you were a herbalist, and their descriptions/what they do. This was pretty cool, because the herbalism skill is usually like, "Alright roll; okay... you find some herbs." Here, though, you could aim to get one particular herb, and then combine it with the other limited ones you had. So that was pretty cool, but because of the rest of the game it was totally forgotten.<br/>(at least, I think the herb thing was from Imagine; again, it's been 14 years).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383266/#Comment_383266" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-24T17:17:18+00:00" title="June 24, 2012  5:17PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2012 5:19PM by Rafu.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Of a game designed by someone with a very narrow experience of role-playing games, somehow very similar to AD&amp;D or to Rolemaster or that kind of things, possibly with some brilliant mechanic buried in it somewhere which still doesn't save it from being a game nobody really wants to play. Of somebody's house-rules from a years-spanning campaign given book form in a hopelessly naive vanity-press operation. Of closeted, cargo-cult players with an amazing deal of enthusiasm for their hobby who nonetheless never looked up "role-playing games" on the Internet.<br/><br/>2. Negative, but not implying anything really bad about the design. In fact, it's only a real "heartbreaker" if some small detail of its design is brilliant. But the term is extremely patronizing towards the designer as a business-person and general human being, in a "they should have known better" way.<br/><br/>3. If I could remember any titles at all, maybe they wouldn't <i>really</i> fit into the category.<br/><br/>Worth noting that the idiom was coined by Ron Edwards <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/9/" rel="nofollow">in this 2002 essay</a> (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/10/" rel="nofollow">and its follow-up</a>), and that's where I first heard it as well.

I think that's heartbreaking enough on its own to qualify, even without adding the additional requirement of having one brilliant/cool detail in it. (Although having that detail definitely ups the heartbreakiness by a huge margin.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383279/#Comment_383279" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-24T20:25:34+00:00" title="June 24, 2012  8:25PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The heartbreaking part is: if they took that one interesting thing they added to some generic and disposable system, and then built the entire game experience around it, it could be really awesome.

There's true brilliance buried in the game, but they loved D&amp;D soooo much that they... they just got eaten. In marketing, they talk about strategies for going up against brand-name giants. Two that pop immediately to mind are parasitical and guerilla. Fantasy Heartbreakers get eaten because they aren't parasitical (they try to break away from the mainstream - which is their great strength) and they aren't geurilla enough (it's just D&amp;D all over again.)<br/><br/>Actually, just read the link to Ron's essay.

Achieveing deep moments of intense and personal wonder. Tweaking and house-ruling and adding special classes and spells and monsters until the loose-leaf binder with all those notes is thicker than the actual rulebooks. Drawing meticulous maps of cities, countries and continents. Making dynastic timelines. Making up a dating system. Writing your buddies' characters into the history, all three generations of them. Correcting the "stupid stuff" in D&amp;D, like alignment, and saving throws, and combat being too easy / too deadly. Writing dwarves that <i>make sense</i>.<br/><br/>One day looking at all that stuff , feeling the wonder, and having the epiphany. "hey, I could publish this, its so much better than D&amp;D!" Writing a manuscript in your evenings and weekends. Learning layout as you go. Constantly referring back to the PHB, DMG and MM for guidance on how to put a gamebook together. Asking your friend, the one that draws the character portraits for the group, to do the art. Saving from your job, borrowing from your grandparents, your uncle, your friends who'll be listed as play-testers until you have enough to buy a print-run of a few thousand copies. Buying an ad in <i>Dragon</i>, squealing with delight when it shows up. Giving "comp" copies to everyone who helped. Mailing off a few more to magazines for review, hoping for good marks, fearing bad ones, upset by no mention at all.<br/><br/>Running demos at the local game shop, comic shop, convention, spending most of the time explaining how the game is better/different than D&amp;D. Contacting <i>Wargames West</i> and asking if they'll sell your game, then learning about distributors. Going for the hail mary: hoarding a bit morce cash to rent a booth at Gen-Con, Origins <i>or both</i>. Piling a few hundred copies into a car, regretting the room you need to leave for the friends going with you. Making do with the cheapest hotel room you can find. "We'll use money from sales for food." Spending every hour of the con sitting at the booth, cajoling every passer-by who browses or even makes eye-contact. Running the spiel, you know it by heart. Sitting at the demo table in the game hall, until you have to admit no ones' showing up. Donating the GM-screen-with-adventure to the prize table and raffle.<br/>Packing it up and going home with more copies left than you like to think about.<br/><br/>Maybe push it for another year or two, maybe turn more campaign notes into adventures so you can keep the game "supported." Eventually though, the distributor returns the unsold stock, or you never get it out of the house to begin with, so those boxes go in the attic or basement. Maybe you keep playing it with your buddies, maybe become a regular fixture at the local con when it comes around every year. Or maybe you grow out of gaming entirely, and those boxes collecting dust are your version of other folks garage-band records.<br/><br/>And then ten years later, online-publishing blossoms and that whole bloody stupid process is rendered irrelevent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383300/#Comment_383300" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T01:31:47+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  1:31AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heavy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383301/#Comment_383301" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T02:23:05+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  2:23AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, so true.

Things like: "So I'm writing a Fantasy Heartbreaker and I want some advice on...". I'd say it used to be negative when the experience of publishing was so painful, but now people are using it to show their understanding of the product they are producing for themselves and their friends and how much use they understand it will get. It seems like a badge of pride to say your game is a Fantasy Heartbreaker sometimes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
