But, I also had another idea (which has been working very well) that I'd never heard of -- so, I thought I'd suggest it . . . use Polaris for PvP. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the *World games (the ones I've played anyway -- mostly Dungeon World) are kind of clunky when it comes to PvP. When I've asked about how other people do it, I sometimes get shocked responses to the tune of: "why would you even ASK such a thing?! Heroes fighting each other?! How unseemly!" But, whatever . . . my group ends up in little spats from time to time. One character will want to throw the ring in the volcano and the other one will want to stop him -- you know how it is. And, I've never been able to figure out how to do it in a satisfying way. Then, it occurred to me that in Polaris, the WHOLE GAME is PvP. So, that might work -- and it totally does. <br/><br/>Here's what we've been doing. When two players are in conflict. The GM will (somewhat arbitrarily) decide which character goes first -- usually it'll be the character who "starts it." Player A will say what he or she does AND THE RESULT of the action (e.g. "I punch him and the face and he falls backwards over the cliff into the river"). Player B either accepts the narration and play continues or says, "But only if [some horrible thing happens to Player A]" (e.g. "but only if Player A's house burns down.") Player A then gets the ability to accept BOTH statements or negate BOTH statements (so that the conflict never happened). It works great. <br/><br/>Two notes: 1) you have to be comfortable with the idea that players in conflict have much more power over the fiction of the world than usual (describing events and results outside of their own character's behavior) -- even so, in our game, the GM has the ability to require revision of any statements that are impossible within the game's internal logic; 2) I left out several of the Polaris key words because they involve Polaris mechanics that aren't in my game.<br/><br/>Anyway -- thought somebody else might be able to make use of this method.                     </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442401/#Comment_442401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-02T22:08:13+00:00" title="February  2, 2015 10:08PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kinda clever.

In D&amp;D, the NPC monsters fight (or otherwise oppose the PCs) in the exact same way that the PCs fight, so there really isn't a problem if the PCs fight each other -- they just proceed as usual. I specifically got tripped up in Dungeon World because the GM doesn't roll the dice. The GM role and the Player role are very different, mechanically. And, (in my view) the mechanics aren't very elegant when BOTH adversaries are using the PLAYER rules. <br/><br/>If a player feels like they are taken out of the fiction because of the Polaris method I proposed, I assume it must be because they feel like they have TOO MUCH power over the results of their own actions. I guess I can buy that objection. One way to look at it that might help is that a PvP roll is always a 7-9 in which you get a victory exactly how you want it . . . with an ugly choice, and the player who describes the ugly choice is the other PC. Then maybe it doesn't seem so far out.  \n<blockquote><br/>2. Potentially not getting anywhere, or having nothing happen.<br/><br/>As an example of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, what do you do if the other player refuses the deal? Does nothing happen at all, or do you keep negotiating, or what?</blockquote>\nIf the player who starts the conflict chooses to negate the original "attack" and the "ugly choice" then it's as if the attacking character changed his or her mind before the conflict began and never chose to start the conflict. This would have the consequence that the target of the original character would, presumably, get away with whatever he or she was trying to accomplish in the first place. So, for example, if Frodo decides to keep the ring and turn invisible and Gollum says, "I attack Frodo and bite his finger off so that the ring will be mine," Frodo would say, "But only if you fall into the volcano and die." If Gollum agrees then that happens. If Gollum negates both, then the story continues with an unmolested invisible Frodo. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442405/#Comment_442405" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-02T22:51:09+00:00" title="February  2, 2015 10:51PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is "but only if..." the only phrase you're using, or others as well?</blockquote>\nI'm pretty much using "But Only If" and "And So it Was" and "It Was Not Meant To Be."
