Turned out it was a quick naive hack with some inherent flaws, but all the same it inspired me to delve deeper into game design and start a serious game project. Now about 8 months later I've got a working game that has been through one 5-session playtest, studio critique from Eero and the iteration cycle after that. I'm gearing up for the second playtest run, now likely GM'd by a friend of mine so I'll get to play it as well. Based on the interest Dungeon Wheel got I thought some of you might like to check this out and maybe even drop some feedback.<br/><br/>So why should you be interested in Blightburgh? As the topic states it's a hybrid between the Apocalypse World engine and Burning Wheel. The dice and move system is adapted from the *W family, so it's smooth flowing, fiction-first and it snowballs with the three-tiered roll results. From the Burning Wheel side it's got the organic lifepath based character creation, character advancement, player written beliefs, a trait system that bears some semblance to BW's character traits, a hero point economy called grit as well as that very player driven gameplay.<br/><br/>It's not just a hack of these two though. I like my fantasy grim, so I took flavor and witchcraft inspiration from Conspiracy of Shadows and the TV series Salem. I also wanted to take a tighter focus to campaigns than BW has, so I locked the setting to a grim SinCity like town, referred to as Blightburgh, and created a situation building procedure that makes starting a campaign more effortless than in BW. The nature of player written beliefs means that you don't get to play as quickly as in *W games, but at least it's less creatively taxing now. The situation generator produces drama/action blood opera intrigues, though a bit darker than in, say, Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>In the next playtest I'll be focusing on the number of basic moves (I have a hunch there may be too many), how easy it's to start a campaign with the procedure (that's a new addition) and polishing other mechanics further. I'll probably need more lifepaths in the final product next year, though this should be enough for testing, so I'll keep an eye out for that too.<br/><br/>A few notes about the document if you're interested in checking Blightburgh out: You need to be familiar with basic PbtA keywords like 'forward' and 'hold', I haven't wasted energy writing those out at this point. Also, even though the PDF is almost 50 pages long, don't be intimidated. Much of it is easily skimmable lifepath lists or moves in big font size.<br/><br/><a href="http://frozendepths.net/blightburgh/Blightburgh_playtest2.pdf" rel="nofollow">Heres a link to the PDF.</a><br/><br/>I'd be more than happy to receive your comments and critique, whether regarding my playtest questions or anything else!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy" title="NYpurdy"><img alt="NYpurdy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/806/nOF4TMGUDI1JH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy">NYpurdy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455622/#Comment_455622" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-17T03:18:00+00:00" title="August 17, 2016  3:18AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for looking at my game! I better return the favor <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So here is some quick feedback<br/><br/>I think you did a good job at conveying your theme with your rules.<br/><br/>I've never played BW, and sheer bulk of the lifepath material took me a bit to get into. Re-reading it I think even the simple fix of saying you start with 4 lifepaths and then having being older/younger be optional would make that section easier to read.<br/><br/>I really like the Blight/Purity relationship, and I like that at the start you just choose your "witchyness" level. The part about your lifepath adding to your purity feels fiddly at first blush.<br/><br/>Sway feels much bigger in scope than the other basic moves. I like it! But I wonder if it fits better someplace else than as a basic move. Calling Sway and Persuade "will" moves also makes them feel supernatural to me. I'm wondering if Will could be switched?<br/><br/>Are Beliefs and Traits and BW thing? I've read through this section a few times, and I realize this is all just a thought experiment, but I'm loving the beliefs but I find the traits leave me cold. <br/><br/>At least there are some things to think about!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Glowie" title="Glowie"><img alt="Glowie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Glowie">Glowie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455628/#Comment_455628" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-17T12:27:33+00:00" title="August 17, 2016 12:27PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff!<br/><br/>The character creation section needs a complete overhaul for clarity in the final version, yeah. I've been tolerating that during development as the details are changing constantly, but I need to do something about it once it's starting to look finished. The fiddly purity bonus from lifepaths is definitely up in the air. It was a suggestion from a playtester, I'll have to see how it feels in the next playtest. The idea was to incentivize staying near your childhood status to get more believable characters.<br/><br/>An excellent point about Sway. If I decide to drop the number of basic moves by 2 after the playtest it'll probably be Observe and Sway, and then Sway becomes a lifepath move. Will could definitely be switched. I'm not a native speaker so I miss some of these implications, it's not meant to be supernatural.<br/><br/>Beliefs and traits are a BW thing. I've pretty much taken beliefs as they are in BW and added more structure to how they're phrased while traits are considerably different. In play the traits work a bit like FATE aspects, which is fun, but the original idea was to align them with the object of the game ("find out how the situations in play change the characters") so that we might see changing behaviour as well as changing skills and beliefs.<br/><br/>Thanks for the comments, these gave me some food for thought!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
