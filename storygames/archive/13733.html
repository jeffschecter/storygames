If you include no copyright statement at all, your rights are assumed.  But if you actively assign the copyright in a garbled manner, you can actually forfeit your claim. (e.g., amateur fan-artists often sign their commissioned drawings with \xa9[Character Name], thus wrecking their IP claim.)<br/><br/>Library catalogs and academic references also base their citations on the publication data.<br/><br/>As for the rules text;<br/><br/>I can see how rules written in a conversational tone might be easier to follow.  But this book's wording seems affected, intentionally obscure. Like a beatnik trying to exclude the squares from understanding him.  Or-- like a square teacher trying to convince the kids he's cool and in the know.<br/><br/>I can see how a writing style might help set the mood for a game.  Maybe Vincent was trying to sound tough?  Instead, AW brings to mind a lecture I once saw on TV, where a blind man berated a room full of architecture grad students for their self-indulgent designs, such as whimsical door handles and entryways which make buildings hell for the disabled to navigate.  Form obstructing function.<br/><br/>I am also reminded of director Kevin Smith, who affects a humble, regular-guy public persona by talking about how "fucking" "cats" "dissed" "my flick" "and whatnot".    I've played dumber-than-I-really-am often, too.   In hopes that I sound less confrontational and less pedantic.   But as Kevin Smith, Vincent, and I approach middle age, expressing ourselves like semi-literate teenagers smacks of lack of self-esteem, self-awareness, and lack of authority.<br/><br/>I'm only on page 14 of the rulebook.<br/><br/>That's farther than I got in Polaris.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310676/#Comment_310676" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T15:47:31+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  3:47PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent chooses his style pretty carefully - If you're put off by that style you're almost certainly not the target audience. <br/><br/>So Stop Reading!

Totally willing to put my own expectations at fault there, though (although, like Jason, sometimes I find it hard to tell the advice from the rules from the color). <br/><br/>I think, for me, once I started reading and saw the stylistic informality, I kind of expected it to sound like the source fiction. Which it doesn't. The AW text doesn't seem like it's especially channeling the tone or vibe or whatever of all the good PA fiction out there: I don't really hear Mad Max (or Robert Neville or Eli or Snake Pliskin) referring to anyone's "dicks and clits," for example. There none of that crazy sing-song patois half-forgotten English (thank God!). It doesn't sound like The Road, but then again if it did that'd mean Vx should be out winning Pulitzers :-) . But whatever; this is all pure aesthetics.<br/><br/>As I was thinking through this this morning, then I started thinking it'd be interesting if the text didn't try to channel the source fiction, but rather the voice of real-world outcasts. Those folks -- bike gang leaders, way-off-the-grid survivalists, millennial cultists -- probably would be even harder to read through. And maybe that's what's missing from the tone, for me: PA fiction often seems like it highlights the "what would we be like if there were no rules?" voice of the survivors: hateful, racist, judgemental, plain crazy. I don't know if I'd feel especially sympathetic to that narrator. <br/><br/>If I had a really constructive criticism of the text to offer, it'd be to make it a bit clearer where the rules start and the color stops, if at all possible. I also found the book's structure to be poor for refererence, but that's so common in RPG writing that it'd be shocking if it were otherwise.

Vincent and I are having a beer; he's like, "hey, I came up with a way to play that's fun, check this out..."  The voice and style he uses reflect an informality of process.  <br/><br/>I've had conversations in which one party would assert that we weren't playing AD&amp;D because we ignored the such-and-such rules for armor types or whatever.  And even when a game flat-out tells you to ignore a rule when it doesn't make sense, they still aren't typically inviting you to tinker with the system.  (And sure, of course we do that stuff all the time anyway, but it's different.)  <br/><br/>Apocalypse World tells you to create custom moves.  It gives you broad ways to implement and interpret the basic moves.  Everything about the game and what Vincent writes outside of the game text indicates that it's really more of a bag of tricks that work well together and you should feel free to monkey with it.  <br/><br/>And that blurring of advice, rules and color; I think that's an element of the whole feeling that we're supposed to have about the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310823/#Comment_310823" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T10:39:17+00:00" title="February  3, 2011 10:39AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2011 10:40AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In theory, I would always prefer that "how to play" instructions be as clear and organized as possible.  Like they are in boardgames.  Two pages of bullet points, with maybe a diagram or two.  But no one can read dozens and dozens of pages of that.  And RPG instructions are <i>long</i>.  So, absent some brilliant way to shrink the page count, I think you kind of <i>have</i> to be entertaining over your dozens of pages of instruction.  I think that writing with personality and simulating a conversation is a neat approach.<br/><br/>Of course, I'd like the conversation better if the person I'm chatting with described the characters and situations in a less middle-school-poetry way.  I kinda hate the AW character blurbs.  Thank god the play examples show clearly that you're not actually expected to talk that way when you play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310840/#Comment_310840" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T11:14:54+00:00" title="February  3, 2011 11:14AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2011 11:15AM by David Artman.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, one can do both--see IAWA, in fact.

They make the book fun to read and help me see how an actual game would would work.  This style of writing, for me, helps me learn the game at the expense of being a reference book.   Conversely, D&amp;D has always been the opposite - great reference books that took lots of cross referencing to figure out how to actually play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310858/#Comment_310858" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T12:15:30+00:00" title="February  3, 2011 12:15PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, is this how we treat people who give an honest critique of a game?

I've also felt that the writing brings us into the implied setting.

I have two very different reactions to <i>Apocalypse World</i> the game and <i>Apocalypse World</i> the text, which underscores something I've argued (sometimes well and sometimes poorly) in the past: A game and its text are two separate yet interrelated things. It's quite possible to love a game and not the text, and vice versa. Go and read the rules for, say, Texas Hold'Em. They can be written in a lot of different ways.<br/><br/>Perhaps my relationship with the <i>Apocalypse World</i> text reveals that I'm a stodgy, dry bore. I'll admit, I feel an underlying implication that I'm just not hip enough if I'm not on board with the voice Vincent chose to deploy in his work\u2014where I get that idea is a whole other issue. What's important is this: Vincent actively, knowingly tried something with his text and I respect that even while I report that it didn't work right for me. Big deal.<br/><br/>I'll refrain from commenting on this thread's commentary on the commentary of the text, except to draw attention to my abstinence, with this vapid loser of a sentence.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310874/#Comment_310874" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T13:03:57+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  1:03PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If that was honest critique, I am a mushroom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310877/#Comment_310877" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T13:06:56+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  1:06PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, we're not talking about a cool, intellectual criticism here.  The elephant in the room is that Todd devoted a lot of his opening salvo to a passive-agressive personal attack.  See the references to self-indulgent architecture and Kevin Smith.  Apparently Vincent's stylistic choice indicates "a lack of self-esteem, self-awareness, and lack of authority."  <br/><br/>Nothing in his post indicates to me that there's some friendly middle ground where he'll enjoy playing the game "beneath the style."<br/><br/>So I think the people here who have said...

I'm asking it so that I understand what bits you don't like.<br/><br/>Also, could you mention some game-related texts that you love for comparison?<br/><br/><i>But Judd, what do you really think?</i><br/><br/>Thanks for asking, sentence in italics, I'll tell you.  I think the AW text, by telling folks how to GM/MC/whatever, brings somethin' out in people and it came up in Paul's thread and in Will's blog posts.  These threads/posts are always defensive right up front with loaded language from the get-go.<br/><br/>And yeah, AW defenders aren't doing these threads any help but by the time we wade past the initial defensive posts, through the defensive over-defenders and get to what was actually happening at the table, the will to communicate on both sides is often gone and we're left with people-who-loves-them-some-AW-and-over-defend-saint-lumpley on one side and AW-crit-martyrs on the other with never the twain to meet.<br/><br/>I think if we cut through 90% of Paul's thread, mentioned above, and got to what he wrote for his fronts that he had trouble connecting to, we'd have gotten somewhere.<br/><br/>I think Will's problem with AW is linked tightly to his tweet in which he said something like, "I think I GM better than I do anything else."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310882/#Comment_310882" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T13:18:20+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  1:18PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) I just want to say that, on the basic moves summary sheet, Dave Berg and I added "Do they speak English in 'what'?!" to the list of questions you can ask the MC after you read a person.<br/><br/>2) Thread of the year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310885/#Comment_310885" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T13:30:40+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  1:30PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will totally cop to starting out my own thing in a strongly defensive posture, because I knew -- <i>I knew!</i> -- exactly what would happen when I posted a critique. And it did. So is that a self-fulfilling prophesy? Would the AW advocates have been all "yeah, cool, I can totally see what you mean by that" had my own OP not referenced the inevitable circling-of-the-wagons?

Hence my comment about creating a healthy environment for vigorous critique. I know I learned my lesson.</blockquote>\nis true. ish.<br/><br/>My claims of Zen are all about "not shitting in cheerios". I don't see that happening here... much. I see a (surprise!) communications issue. The root of like 90% of all internet problems, right?<br/><br/>Todd's opener is a BLOGGY POST, it's not a critique, as Graham rightly called out. The fact that he did it here rather than on his blog is because obviously (enforced by his much later acknowledgement quoted above which I bolded)  wanted some kind of feedback. Of some sort (if he/whomever doesn't want feedback/challenge, well yeah then it's fair as John H notes to say "tell us what you are looking for, else take it to your blog"). He's not just shit-kicking to publicly flame a game and generate Crowd Reaction Points, but to get some contrary ideas and opinions. I've seen trolling, and although it may look like Todd's first post, it pretty much ends with an aggressive/trying reaction to every contrary response; and that's not happening here, he's listening.<br/><br/>This goes back to that hurdle we all jumped a few years ago, and Judd kinda pointed it out. For those of you who were around for those flamewars/community discussions, we learned to ask: "What *is* the point of this thread then?" A question for both the original poster, or responders if the point isn't clear. Want to see a certain kind of response, or harvest a particular reaction? Then *state what you're looking for*. It's the Internet Conversation version of the Free and Clear rules - slash - Stating Intent in Conflict.<br/><br/>It's not clear from the start, so there's a lot of flailing. Reaction. Once we get over that and get some idea of the intent and goal of the thread, then some real discussion happens (and that happened above, thanks to Judd and others pulling at it, and he's right: Now just gotta hope that folks are still interested once the dust settles and we figured what the thread was all about).<br/><br/>In the future, I guess what I'd like to see more of (some people are in a real habit of this, others are not) is people clarifying what they want out of the thread, if it's unclear. If the intent of the thread is unclear to the responder, they should go ahead and point that out and ask what they want out of the thread.<br/><br/>As there was confusion, the thread clearly could have ended by Ry's JD's or skinnyghost's (particularly poignant restatement of the perceived goal) thread. <br/><br/>Public bloggy posts are cool, try to end them with What You Want from your replies. I mean, otherwise you'd just post on your blog, right? Reaction threads are fine, just try to end with a question or statement of what you're sincerely looking for, and all would probably progress further. That bolded part was just that, only pretty late in the game.<br/><br/>If you see a reaction thread, and it's not clear what the author was looking for, feel free to come out and ask.

Next time I will take more care with details that we all vomit everywhere on these internets.

I felt, for a little while, like Vincent was getting credit for something that lots of GMs do and have done, as if that was somehow taking something away and giving it to him. That was crazy talk, on my part. As if there's a limited amount of expertise to go around. Vincent Baker took some things that were on the tips of a lot of tongues and gave them names. That's praiseworthy, to be sure.<br/><br/>I've also said before, and I'll say it again, that GMing is a skill, which means you can get better at it. But of course we don't get better at it by <i>not</i> codifying it. So, no, I'm all for the codification of GMing techniques. I'm all for GMs sharing and informing and swapping tales.<br/><br/>That I have issue with some of the text of AW (and the context through which it reached me) is a separate thing\u2014but I won't go into that now because  it goes against what I'm trying to do on Story Games these days. Still, cats and bags, I continue to feel like an out-of-towner here and it's not just because I'm an oversensitive critic.

Sometimes it arises around certain games, sometimes it arises around certain theory discussions, and its always characterized by defensiveness mixed in with legitimate commentary.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy take is this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a certain set of gamers who think that the most awesome part of any role playing game is them...whether because they are awesome players or awesome GMs...the game is great because they are great.<br/>\nThere's a certain subset of those gamers who take a great deal of pride in their ability to bring that awesome...even to otherwise crappy games.<br/>\nOne pattern of these two things is a tendency by some to defend otherwise crappy games based on the fact that they actually experienced great play with them...mistaking their own ability to bring the awesome for an inherent quality of the game itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother pattern is that there is a certain sub subset of gamers who, because of their pride in their hard earned skill to bring the awesome, have a tendency to view various elements of theory or "how to play this game properly" advice in texts as a personal affront.  Not all such advice or text:  When its in an area that that gamer hadn't thought of or feels isn't their strong suit they are often eager for advice on how to get better.  But when the text or theory is on an area they already consider a personal area of expertise, and it advises doing something different than what they normally do...and ESPECIALLY when the text advises or implies (or the culture around the theory / game advises) that to play "right' you have to let go of your "baggage" and the "baggage" being referred to is the very stuff that those gamers are super proud of...THEN you get threads like this one.  Threads that demonstrate a heart felt desire to understand and learn and succeed, struggling against a background of defensiveness and offended sensibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs usual, Judd is spot on when he diagnosis that as half the problem, and the other half as responding defensively to the defensiveness.  My first impulse when reading the OP, was "Fuck Off Todd."  and that was just as much bullshit as the majority of the OP.  People talk about the weakness of the internet as a communication medium, but that's not really true.  The communication weakness is our human tendency to argue with patterns rather than actual issues.  The internet didn't create that weakness, it just doesn't help to overcome it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I find the text of AW to be a masterpiece.  IMO its by far the most clear explanation Vincent has ever given on How to Play one of his games...in the actual rules text of the game.  In that regard I think it even outshines Dogs which had to resort to some vague hand wavery because (I think) he hadn't yet figured out how to articulate fully what he wanted you to actually DO in the game.  In a Wicked Age suffered mightily from that problem as did Poison'd.  Folks may recall the many harsh threads around those games and how the text in the book didn't at all line up with the actual intention of how to play...at least not until after you learned the actual intention from another source and could then interpret the text better with that knowledge in place (which is what was necessary for me to have IaWA go from "meh" to one of my all time favorite games).<br/>\n<br/>\nNo single text is going to appeal equally to everyone, but quite frankly, I find criticizing the text of AW to be somewhat laughable and somewhat puzzling.  Its so far ahead of the fast majority of game texts out there in terms of actually telling you what to do to play successfully that bashing it for missing perfection rather than appreciating it for getting as close as it did seems rather ungracious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311057/#Comment_311057" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T06:51:53+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  6:51AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 5:14AM by Todd_L.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marhault,<br>I met Vincent once in 2005 and again a couple weeks ago. He has influenced my life for the better.  Listen to the Poison'd and Mechaton episodes of Ninjas vs Pirates if you want to evolve your gamedesignbrain way forward. But, you'll also hear a coyness in his speech that may be genuine or may be stylized, a bit contrived. It would be preposterous for me to say I'm certain which. And far from elevated discourse. Likewise, I can't say whether his dignified response to criticism is a public front of good manners, or the entireity of his reaction. But sparing-his-feelings isnt the only reason to steer clear. Me not wanting to be a petty person is reason, too.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311064/#Comment_311064" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T07:42:30+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  7:42AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2011 7:46AM by lumpley.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have some thoughts.<br><br>Thought 1: Criticize away. Complain away, vent away! Like I say, that's what I sign up for when I publish. If I can't stand it, I have no business doing it. So it ever is and must be.<br><br>Thought 2: When you make the leap from criticizing someone's writing to criticizing their person, it makes you presumptuous; you've overstepped both your own business and good grace. It's rude, it reflects badly on you. It makes perfect sense to me that Todd wants not to do it, no matter how well I'll take it (and I'm likely to take it pretty well, as Jamey says). (And Todd said the same while I was composing this. Hi Todd!)<br><br>Thought 3: None of the complaints here are really addressed to me at all. You're talking to each other, as fellow readers. This is fine! It's an essential, inevitable conversation and this is a good venue for it. The venue for direct reader-writer feedback isn't public posts on Story Games, it's, y'know, direct. It doesn't demand an audience.<br><br>I do find these conversations informative. They do affect the way that I'll write my next book. Watching while readers have a conversation about your writing is different from getting direct feedback, but it's <i>also</i> valuable. Every bit as valuable! Conversations like this, I learn equally from every side; I pay close attention to the whole lot, complaints, praise, questions, answers. My usual rule is to not participate at all, just to watch and learn, unless someone asks me a direct question or requests a valley girl playbook.<br><br>Thought 4: I know that some of you have probs with it, but I'd really recommend the Forge as a place for higher-quality critical discussion. Todd, you might try a post like your opening post in the Forge's publishing forum. The various tones and writing styles of games' texts is a great topic for a publishing discussion, and the Forge would take it seriously as such. I'd be delighted to answer questions there about the choices I made. ("Vincent, were you trying to sound tough?" "Hm. Kind of. I know better than to try to sound <i>tough</i>, but I was trying to sound kind of scuzzy or something, yes. It's a lot like the voice in kill puppies for satan - allied with the PCs, of their world, but with a clearer view than they have.")<br><br>-Vincent

for criticism of AW's tone is because the tone is so much OF the game. It's not the spicy mustard; you can't wipe it off the rules. The rules themselves make certain suppositions of tone. For instance, the playbooks aren't just classes; they're fairly strong character personalties as well. Some of the players I've played it with don't like the suppositions of character. I have no response for that. The game has quite a bit of creative constraint built in and much of that constant is built around its tone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in this case, the response must be: well, maybe it's not for you. But I'd play it first. And see.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther personal commentary? Watching the game be played perfectly correctly *per the rules*, yet not in the tone of playbooks has always been, for me, watching a game that is falling apart. Movement towards the presented tone is a shift towards better gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311073/#Comment_311073" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T08:09:06+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  8:09AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I sense is anger, "Hey, everybody's liking this game, why the fuck is it written in this way that annoys me - it makes it harder for me to get to the game."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311112/#Comment_311112" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T10:03:49+00:00" title="February  4, 2011 10:03AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's possible that it was worth reading through all the flotsam of this thread just to be lead to the instruction "Ask that player which of your stats is the most, like, y\u2019know, and highlight it."<br><br>I mean, it probably isn't, but it's possible.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311133/#Comment_311133" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T12:08:41+00:00" title="February  4, 2011 12:08PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2011 12:13PM by The_Magus.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read a number of Vincent's RPGs and also Mechaton and I think AW is by far the best written in terms of conveying the rules.

I'm curious. Do you think that if the text of AW was written in a different 'style', or tone, or in the parleyance of fuctional grammer: a different 'genre', would it make the mechanics more accessible (to you), or allow you to enjoy the game quantifiably 'more' than using the text as written?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I ask is, I think you've hit a quandry for many game designers in that the tone / presentation of any given rpg text needs to be a careful decision based on your target audience, your aims in explaining / teaching the game and its usefulness as a reference guide during play. You will never be able to please everybody in this regard. So either you make compromises to your 'vision' and instigate a broader appeal, or you go with your original 'tone' and perhaps isolate / confuse / turn off your potential audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading your examples of rpg texts that you find 'accessible' (for a variety of reasons), AW definately stands out as the odd duck, but will it actually stop you from playing the game? Or do you want to play the game? If you do, will the format and 'tone' of the text influence whether or not you enjoy the game and want to keep playing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the questions I'm interested in discussing, do these concerns limit us playing games and having fun?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311306/#Comment_311306" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T22:20:03+00:00" title="February  5, 2011 10:20PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Episode 61 of Theory from the Closet addresses the issue of rulebook as highly-personalized objet d'art vs. no-nonsense aid to gameplay:<br/><br/><a href="http://theoryfromthecloset.com/2010/09/06/show061-interview-with-keith-senkowski-and-matt-synder/" rel="nofollow">http://theoryfromthecloset.com/2010/09/06/show061-interview-with-keith-senkowski-and-matt-synder/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13733/apocalypse-world-the-writing-style-bothers-me/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13733/apocalypse-world-the-writing-style-bothers-me">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13733/apocalypse-world-the-writing-style-bothers-me/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13733/apocalypse-world-the-writing-style-bothers-me/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13733%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13733%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
