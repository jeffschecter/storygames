It was for the first session of a series called 'The Horatio Club Mountebanks'. The PCs are members of The Horatio Club (from <i>GURPS: Time Travel</i>), a social club for time travelers from all eras and timelines. They are also secretly members of a faction called the Mountebanks, who are known to perform some ethically and temporally questionable activities for the right price...<br/><br/>So without any further ado, "Let's Steal Abe Lincoln!"<br/><br/>****<br/><i><b>EPISODE ONE: Lincoln Continental</b></i><br/><br/><b>The Pitch</b><br/>James Somerset, Secret Agent in Her Majesty's Secret Service (retired), is contracted by an unknown party to acquire the body of Abraham Lincoln from the <a href="http://members.aol.com/RVSNorton1/Lincoln51.html" rel="nofollow">funeral train that is wending its way across the country in April-May 1865.</a>. The employer stresses that it is imperative that the body be obtained prior to its embalming, and that the operation be done discreetly, so that the locals have no idea the body is missing. Due to the nature and dispersal of temporal gates into the locale, it is determined that the best window for the operation is the night of Saturday April 29 as the train made its way from Cleveland to Columbus, Ohio (Also, the players had the exact schedule for this leg of the journey).<br/><br/>Somerset (Chris) is the Mastermind for the session. He assembles a crew:<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Steel Tiger (Bill), a ninja from Feudal-era Nippon.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Helmut von Mauer (John), a dashing hussar from Napoleonic-era Prussia.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Molly Chen (Mandy), a rouge of Chinese extraction who keeps mum on her background.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Amelia (Emily), a gadgeteer from the mid-21st century. <br/><br/><br/><b>The Plan</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Round One</span><br/>* Somerset arrives in Cleveland the day the funeral train is to arrive. He has made some forged VIP passes (Mental Feat) for the train, as some mourners were allowed to ride the train from town to town along its route. He plans to use one pass for himself and sells a number of others to get some local currency, and also to sew confusion aboard the now overcrowded train.<br/><br/>* Two days before, Steel Tiger leaps silently aboard the moving train and drills holes underneath the funeral car, in order to loosen floor (Physical Feat).<br/><br/>* One week earlier, as the train prepares to depart Washington DC, Helmut leaves Prussian embassy and meets a Pinkerton named James McParlan (Letter of Introduction - Jack of Clubs) who is assigned to train security. James gets Helmut assigned to permanent berth as a foreign dignitary. Helmut boards the train in Washington. Strikes up conversation with Mary Todd Lincoln who is polite but curt (turns out she hates Prussians for some unspecified reason) (Social Feat - the result was low enough that the Mastermind was allowed to add a complication).<br/><br/>* Molly Chen (disguised as boy) has obtained an official train crew uniform (Letter of Credit) and builds a concealed platform with a trapdoor under train car (Letter of Credit). She tests the platform and trap door during a routine maintenance stop (Physical Feat). The compartment is large enough to conceal a coffin beneath the train.<br/><br/>* Amelia boards the train in Philadelphia wearing a large black mourning gown with a massive hooped skirt, under which she has concealed her laptop (Physical Feat) and all manner of wonderful electronic espionage toys. She bribes a very helpful boy into placing a number of microdot narrow wave broadcasting cameras around the train.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Round Two</span><br/>* Somerset boards the train and attempts to attempts to subdue guard but accidentally kills him (Physical Feat - the result was low enough that the player to the mastermind's right was allowed to add a complication). He takes guard uniform, but it doesn't fit him very well beacuse the guard is taller than Somerset -- by a lucky coincidence (or excellent planning?) the dead guard is actually about Lincoln's height.<br/><br/>* Steel Tiger - still a day or so ahead of the train's arrival in Cleveland - lays smoke and flash bombs for distraction/confusion later on (Physical Feat). He also frightens a maid (Letter of Introduction- Jack of Hearts) into believing there is a ghost onboard. Most of the VIP mourners and dignitaries aboard are not scared, but the train workers and general populace are very on edge.<br/><br/>* Helmut makes another attempt to engage Mary Todd Lincoln in conversation, and when it does not go well he changes tack and, playing off her well known mental illness, attempts to get her all histrionic (Social Feat). Mary Todd Lincoln (played now as a Letter of Introduction - the Queen of Clubs) has a complete meltdown, causing distraction at just the moment when the switch is to go off.<br/><br/>* Molly befriends an Chinese engineer (Letter of Introduction Jack of Clubs) who helps her sabotage the train. Lots of steam and flames shoot from the engine and the entire train moves ahead jerkily just as the switch is about to occur. Molly gets into position and waits.<br/><br/>* Amelia slips into the compartment beneath the funeral car, where the deceased guard's body has been stashed, and uses some nanomachines to perform cosmetic surgery on the guard's face (Physical Feat). The result is pretty convincing. With that done, she joins Robert Todd Lincoln, whose affections she has won over the past few days (Letter of Introduction - Jack of Spades) and has Robert introduce her around to some people (a Social Feat played through RTL. The result is low enough that the Mastermind adds a complication). She meets someone named Jack Buchanan, whom she recognizes as a member of the Horatio Club!<br/><br/><b>[THREAD CONTINUED IN COMMENT BELOW]</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/editswithlonghair" title="editswithlonghair"><img alt="editswithlonghair" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i118/editswithlonghair/21-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/editswithlonghair">editswithlonghair</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58404/#Comment_58404" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-28T16:26:37+00:00" title="February 28, 2007  4:26PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Round Three</span><br/>* Jack Buchanan (Letter of Introduction - Jack of Diamonds) is there to carry out a hit on Robert Todd Lincoln to prevent the later assassination of James A. Garfield (the logic behind this remains unclear). he fires his revolver into Robert's gut! Buchanan assumes his target dead and flees, believing that with the deplorable state of medicine in this era there would be no way to save him. But he has not counted on fellow time travelers meddling in his business! Amelia (playing a number of blue chips for some dramatic editing) is able to administer some emergency first aid, assisted by her fleshweaving nanites, and saves Robert's life. Somerset pursues Buchanan to the top of the train where the two of them fight dramatically (Physical Feat). Buchanan is thrown from the top of the moving train into the night.<br/><br/>* Steel Tiger meets with Kiro (Letter of Introduction - Queen of Hearts), a Chinese railroad worker, who will make a track switch to an unexpected route on a spur, where the switch and subsequent getaway will happen away from the crowds lining the train's route. When the signal is given Steel Tiger springs through the panel int he floor of the funeral car and drops a number of smoke bombs! This is the same moment that the engine begins smoking and lurching and Mrs Lincoln gets hysterical! In all the chaos, Steel Tiger lifts the fake Lincoln from below and makes the swap for the actual body of Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>* Helmut checks his watch and looks out the window to see their getaway vehicle approaching: it is of course an airship (Letter of Credit) piloted by friend and Horatio member Alberto Santos-Dumont, (Letter of Introduction - Jack of Hearts). The chaos on the train ceases momentarily as everyone turns to look at the airship (The feat for the Airship escape was low enough that the Mastermind introduced a complication). As zeppelins and airships had not yet been invented, this causes a new round of confusion, which further works up Mary Todd Lincoln.<br/><br/>* Molly persuades Robert Todd Lincoln (Mandy re-uses the Jack of Spades to play through Robert) to try to explain away the airship as swamp gas or somesuch (Mental Feat), and everyone is convinced! A President's son must know what he is talking about, after all. Molly and Steel Tiger pop out under the train with the real Lincoln's corpse while everyone is distracted by Robert's excellent explanation of the properties of swamp gas.<br/><br/>*After being sure that Robert is uninjured, Amelia slips away to a private car with her laptop, to watch the entire operation via her microdot cameras, helping to coordinate the entire thing through radio receivers the entire team has been outfitted with beforehand (Mental Feat).<br/><br/>* The crew, with the body of Abraham Lincoln, are lifted in a basket to the awaiting airship, which drifts away silently in the clouds. Cut to 6 days later in Springfield, IL. The coroner receives Lincoln's body from the funeral train and performs an inspection. The camera pans up to reveal that the coroner is in fact Somerset, who has been 'in country' for the past year establishing this cover identity. He certifies this body 'is indeed the former President' and completes the embalming, preserving the timeline's historical consistency.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Getaway</b><br/>* Chris passes his turn<br/>* Bill passes his turn<br/>* John and Mandy get into bidding war for this turn, but John takes the round. A Mountebank cleanup crew of Natalia (Letter of Introduction - Queen of Hearts) and an older Jack Buchanan (Letter of Introduction - King of Diamonds) comes in after the airship escape with MIBesque memory wipers to wipe the entire train (Mental Feat - the result is low enough that the Mastermind introduces a complication). The memory wipers don't seem to work on Robert Todd Lincoln, possibly due to the shock of his recent blood loss, possibly because he has already seen some unusual things. Rather than leave him behind and risk contaminating the timeline, Robert Todd Lincoln is invited to join the Horatio Club.<br/>* Mandy wins round. Back at the Horatio Club, an older Robert Todd Lincoln is revealed to be the mysterious employer. He injects his father's body with some sort of super-nanites, bringing Abraham Lincoln back to life. "Hi, dad." he says, wiping a tear from the corner of his eye.<br/>* Emily passes her turn<br/>* Chris Passes his final turn<br/><br/><br/><b>The Take</b><br/>There are 34 chips in the Loot Bag: 6 for each member of the crew, plus Chris and Bill are awarded the extra 2 each.<br/><br/><br/>Fade to black...<br/><br/>*******<br/>We all somehow managed to stay working together with no backstabbing, which may have been a first in our Caper sessions! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> <br/><br/>I also decided on a rules adjustment-- going to make it that you can only use a particular face card as a Letter of Introduction once per game. Once you've used it to create a NPC to perform a bonus Feat Check, it doesn't get shuffled back into the deck. We noticed that most players (myself included) were always using the face cards in their hand to get the NPC's bonus Feat, even though mathematically it would often be better to use the face card to increase your own charcater's Feat Check... you'd earn more chips that way. Also, we felt the story sometimes suffers by having hordes of LoI 'cameos' coming into the movie and stealing scenes and doing all the PC's work! So, we'll see how one use only works out next time.<br/><br/>We're going to be playing session two this coming Monday. No idea yet what the plot for the episode will be yet. So far, ideas that have been pitched are stealing the James Ossuary in the early 21st century and selling it Moses Shapira in the mid 19th century, or saving the films of Theda Bara from the Fox Films vault before they go up in flames in 1937... either way, it should be fun!<br/><br/>Oh, and Chris has already called dibs on using Robert Todd Lincoln as his new PC. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
