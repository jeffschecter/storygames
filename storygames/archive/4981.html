Upgrades stable? What's the plan for the next six months? How can we help?</blockquote>\nOnly 10 days or so late with my response. :-)<br/><br/>So here's just a stream of consciousness thing:<br/><br/>* Overall I love it here. Personally, I've found my online gaming talk experience seriously atrophying. I've retreated from most online sites and pretty much sticking around here, checking RPGNet once a day or so, and from there skimming the Forge and Gamecraft now and then. It's basically because the discussion that goes on here (and for the most part, the tone) really works for me here than other places. But that's just me. But me saying, "I still love what we've got here".<br/><br/>* We had a server move. The third since the creation of the site. Here's some stuff on that front:<br/>-- The move was successful. Except for the fact that foreign lang characters got corrupted. I'll make sure to look into not doing that again if we have to backup/restore.<br/>-- We moved originally from NetProHosting (they host a number of my sites currently) because our mySQL install was killing the global performance.<br/>-- We then moved to Dreamhost, and it was awesome for a while. But they've been having some real chronic issues with stability on the hosts, stability on the mySQL DB server, etc. We were crashing every few days, and mySQL was lagging all the time.<br/>-- I found out that this was because the "Notify me by email when there's a new post on this thread" 3rd party extension for Vanilla is some total crap, and a total resource hog. Turning that off got us a reprieve, but the writing was already on the wall at that point.<br/>-- We moved to MediaTemple, on one of their virtual grid storage machines, a few weeks back. Aside from one planned outage that I didn't pay attention to, I've been enthusiastic about the uptime and performance. <br/>-- I haven't turned on the "notify" extension, because, agian, crap. But to compensate, I've left the feeds up and running, and I've also increased the number of displayed threads to the max number so that you can check back in 2-5 days and pick up on the threads you posted to, without having to check back every single time a new post is added to your thread.<br/><br/>* The social traffic has been great.  I'm the administrator and mod of this site. And I rarely ever have to mod. Ironically, the only mod action I had to take in the last month or two happened this last week. But the site runs itself. As a mod who is also a participant, who also has an extraordinarily complex and stressful job with lots of overtime, this is a godsend. You may notice that there are runs of 2-4 days in a row where I only log in maybe once just to see what's up, without posting or nothing. And yet, there's plenty of interesting stuff to come back to when I finally get a chance.<br/>-- I love that I don't have to hem and haw and create artificial traffic to generate "teh buzz"<br/>-- I love that even 3 weekdays of traffic, the posts have not scrolled off the front page (admittedly, I bumped it to 100 threads per page). So I can take a few days off here and there and not worry about missing anything.<br/>-- I love that the place pretty much moderates itself. There's still a community feel here. There are "rules", but for the most part I don't see us often having to fall back on them.<br/><br/>* Traffic stats, for your reading pleasure:<br/>-- About 3000 unique sessions per day. (urchin)<br/>-- About 44,000 hits/page hits per day.<br/>-- About 280 mb/xfer a day.<br/>-- Funniest Search Term for Referral to this Site: "panty + crud"<br/><br/>(continued)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111912/#Comment_111912" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T08:50:39+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  8:50AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other Stuff that's on my mind:<br/><br/><b>* Feedback.

Social stuff? <br/> Feel free to post feedback or "stuff you want to see" in this thread</b><br/><br/>* More features: I've been waffling on a chat feature forever. Not sure how I want to implement it, though, or even if it's all that needed. Thoughts on who might use chat, or what it would be used for?<br/><br/>* Since the move, and a Vanilla upgrade, most of the special text that I had used to pimp out the registration process has been reset. Stuff like, a more detailed "User Agreement" where you agree not to do illegal shit, but you also agree not to be a dick. And that spells out, up front, a little more of what we're about. That sort of thing. I need to maybe do that this winter break, and back it up so that future upgrades don't wash it away again.<br/><br/>* I need to rewrite and reorganize the "Rules and Purpose of Story Games" thread, to make it more relevant and include some of the "house rules" and suggestions we've been using to conduct ourselves that haven't been etched in stone.<br/><br/>* Meetups: I want to take the Meetups Thread and turn it into a Meetups Wiki Page on the Codex, and create a new tab in the top tabs to link directly to that page for easy access. That will happen in the next month or so.<br/><br/>* Orie is working on a site Mascot (no longer the comfortable red chair, although the comfortable red chair is an element that will be with us forever). The mascot is the Story Games Laser Princess.<br/><br/>* I'm thinking about putting a Paypal donation link on the site, so folks can give if they want. Maybe do a yearly drive. The site isn't all that expensive, but I know folks have told me forever "Make Me a Paypal Link so I can Throw Money at Your Site!!!", so hell, who am I to stop that?  I can use the money for web fees, ease the cost of technical work done on the site, and to pay for beers at con trips.<br/><br/>Hmmm. Anything else?

And how later I had kinda retracted that? Here's a bit of the story behind that:<br/><br/>* So I never wanted to replace The Forge, or to make this place into A Forge for Folks who Don't Like the Forge. When it comes to putting a game together, getting feedback, and especially getting information on design and publishing resources (where to print, etc), Forge is second only to Your Friends You Game With (IMO anyway). <br/><br/>* But hey, we have a lot of Forge folks here. That's cool, because this place started out being nothing more than a "The Forge Birthday Forum, focusing on light game talk" that never ended. <br/><br/>* However, the real main purpose of the site had been kinda threefold:<br/>-- To be kind of an enthusiastic "RPGNet" of small press games.<br/>-- A place to discuss techniques for playing and running games, and<br/>-- A place to discuss new ways of playing and running games (not necessarily tied to design, but sometimes), be it for small press or traditional RPGs.<br/><br/>* The idea of "designing on the site", or "getting feedback for your game idea", was supposed to be something that happened every once in a while, and sort of a privelege for SG regulars: You show up, you realize you like the community, you hang out for a bit and post or just lurk around, and if you think this is the kind of place with people who will give you good feedback, you post about your game idea.<br/><br/>* Essentially, I didn't want the "threads that focus on the purpose of the site" to get scrolled away by one post after another from new people showing up saying "Help me with my game", new users joining just to suck up that feedback without, I dunno, "giving their due to others" and all that.  <br/>-- That's why the Game Design Help topic is hidden to outsiders: It reinforces that it's a membership thing only. It also prevents folks from using this place as an open design blog for the public. It reinforces the "you're a member, here's a privelege, get some feedback and do something with it" model.<br/>-- And yet, I still got nervous at times, as I saw many people join with a Join Message of "I'm working on a game", or "I want feedback on my design", etc. Sometimes like 20 at a time.<br/>-- And yet... My fears remain unfounded. Folks have been using the site as intended, and we haven't been swamped with a million threads that would be better served on The Forge or RPGNet's Design Forum. <br/>-- So I chilled the hell out and don't worry about it much anymore. Because everything is in order.<br/>-- And furthermore, it's not just "in order", but the ideas and threads generated in the design threads have been really awesome, and something that I'd like to see continue, in just the proportions that we see today.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111926/#Comment_111926" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T09:09:30+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  9:09AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, we can't make the super-secret forums public.

The chat here was great for a while, because there were a bunch of regulars that hung out in there. You could log on at almost any time during the day, and find people to chat with. That died back a lot, when people got busy or changed jobs.<br/><br/>The chat has been pretty dead for a while, and more like ships passing in the night. I personally miss chatting with the other regulars and meeting/chatting with the more infrequent visitors.

Consider me sold.<br/><br/>Also, I've been thinking of a nascent way of re-splitting the forum categories, recombining them and forming them in new ways. There's been a lot of game design talk, interspersed with game play talk and contest talk. I'm thinking of a groundwork that clearly splits design talk from play talk, yet keeps it all friendly and active side by side, yet can still be excised by folks who want to visually block that category and focus only on Story Games Play (rather than Story Games Design) and vice-versa.<br/><br/>I might need some ideas or suggestions on that front later.

The Story-Games Names project could reach so many more gamers if it had a cover price of $20 instead of $11, ironically -- then, it could be sold (at IPR's or another method's discount) to retail and get on shelves.  (Why can't that be done at its pricepoint of $11?  Well, that's the cost of printing the book -- discount *that* and the project loses money instead of operating "at cost".)<br/><br/>I talked with Chris and Endgame about the Names book and he's just crushed he can't get it through IPR or somesuch -- we both consider it one of the most important gamer resources to have come out <i>ever</i>, but as it stands, it's not going to end up at his store, in the hands of his customers.
