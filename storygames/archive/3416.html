I've had a few people tell me that Loser Narrates is categorically better than Winner Narrates. I know we will also find a large sector of the SG crowd opposed to GM Narrates (which I'm using as shorthand for narration rights fixed in one participant)--whether it's D&amp;D backlash or fear of tyranny or some such. Personally, I don't see it, but my last query sparked a pretty interesting thread, so I thought I'd pose this one too.<br/><br/>My question is simple: GM Narrates vs. Winner Narrates vs. Loser Narrates -- which do you prefer and why? In particular, I'd like to hear both pros and cons for each method and see if we can map out the strengths and limitations of each, e.g., if you prefer one, do you think another might be better suited for a particular type of game or particular genre?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77141/#Comment_77141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T12:04:07+00:00" title="June 22, 2007 12:04PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't mean to threadcrap but I think it's basically all about what is right for the game.

One of the best parts of role-playing is when your character does something cool or spectacular.  I know a lot of players that live for those moments.  If your character has succeeded (and is presumably at her best), *you* should be the one to say how it happens.  What I'm trying to say is that GM or Loser Narrates is deprotagonizing. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I do see value in involving other people in resolution.  For instance, in most cases, the loser is losing *something* (a resource, XdY hit points, reputation, dignity) to the winner as a consequence of the conflict.  Why not have the loser choose the *something* he loses, and have the winner describe how she wins it?  That way, no one is particularly deprotagonized by the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, any resolution that is in the hands of one participant is going to be deprotagonize (starting to hate this word now) someone, so perhaps involvement from all parties in the conflict is optimal. <br/>\n<br/>\n*Steps back to make room for people that know what they are talking about.*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Conflicts are odd in that you have goals, stakes, and narrative rights which are potentially contradictory in play all at the same times; conflict resolution seems less like win-vs-lose and more like creating twists and turns in the flow of the story.<br/><br/>At almost every opportunity, you may not fully get your goal, you're risking an unrelated stake, and the narrative rights are almost capricious.

I want to contribute to the game, and some of the most exciting stuff is the resolution of things.<br/><br/><em>FLFS</em> uses Winner Narrates because the game is full of highly idiosyncratic means of success -- by which I mean, if I win some conflict or another, I want to fully describe how I use my ether-torch to set the debutante's dress on fire, and I want to describe it as my character would do it.  I don't want somebody else describing how my character does things, because this game is very much about my conception of my character and everyone else serves as foils, not authors, of my character.<br/><br/><em>Sons of Liberty</em> has everybody narrate a part of the resolution of a Level, although the loser goes first and the winner goes last, thereby giving the winner a sort of 'last word.'

I find that this works well because the game is trying to emulate the Caper and Heist movie and book genre, one in which the main characters are often in over their heads in situations that are completely out of their control.  I find it's also useful because it keeps up the frenetic pace of the game.  <br/><br/>I do make a very strong distinction though that players have complete control of what happens right up to the second that the con-res system kicks in.  If they say that their character takes a quick breath and lines up his pistol on the guys head, then that happens.  If they say that their character spins around on his heel and arches his leg upwards in a perfect kicking arc, then there you go.  No matter the outcome of the con-res mechanic the GM picks up from there, describing outcome based on player input from the Intent phase.  <br/><br/>I also like both of the other narration rights approaches.  I've had the chance to play with Winner-narrates in InSpectres, and the narration rights of Mountain Witch, both of which were a ton of fun.  <br/><br/>I tend to run most of my games with a general "table narrates' approach, no matter which game we're playing.  Whoever has narrative control says his piece, but if someone else at the table has a cool idea then they are welcome to speak up and describe what they are thinking.  Final narrative control would rest with whomever the system designates, but suggestions are always welcome.  I understand that there isn't really much in the way of mechanical support for that sort of thing, but I think it's integral for "table unity", so to speak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77193/#Comment_77193" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T15:40:03+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  3:40PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lately, I like "people who aren't directly involved in the scene narrate", since it gets the most people at the table possible involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77194/#Comment_77194" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T15:45:50+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  3:45PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Building off of Shreyas and Michael, I think it's very important to draw a distinction here between "who narrates" and "who gets final say over what happens". Consider these two examples:<br/><br/>Winner: I hit with a 16!<br/><br/>GM: All right, John, so Steve finally breaks through your wall of denial and you have a cathartic breakdown, where you cry and hug him and stuff.

How do you guys think it should go? John, we know you come out overcoming your grief - I mean, it has to be a pretty significant moment.<br/><br/>Loser: Yeah, like, maybe I do shed a tear, you know, but it's more like Clint Eastwood in <i>The Bridges of Madison County</i> type of thing, where he turns his face away and just has the one tear.<br/><br/>Winner: And I totally put my hands in my pockets and just give him space.<br/><br/>Loser: And I turn back after a few moments and say, "All right. So, what's next?" But I've got that silent thanks going on.<br/><br/>GM: Rock on. I approve.

And what if the debutante is another PC?<br/>In the ethical universe of <em>FLFS</em>, success defines character while failure challenges it.  Therefore, if you lose a conflict, the GM gets direction -- which means the GM can narrate, ask you to narrate your own failure, or ask some other player to narrate your failure.<br/><br/>Alternately, if you have a player-versus-player situation, it's a dynamic roll with both sides rolling dice against each other.  Whoever wins gets the narration.  So if you lose, they win, and they get to narrate their success and your failure, challenging your characterization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77223/#Comment_77223" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T22:54:07+00:00" title="June 22, 2007 10:54PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2007 10:54PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my group, "GM narrates" is the only one that works because most don't like to step that far out of their character, it completely ruins and shits on their enjoyment to ask them to narrate.<br/><br/>For me personally, I like 'em all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77225/#Comment_77225" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T23:42:36+00:00" title="June 22, 2007 11:42PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I wouldn't even try to pretend that I personally think one of them is inherently better than the other two.<br/><br/>I can say that the group I play in has come down firmly on the "GM narrates" line, probably for the same reason that JDCorley gives: they like staying in character more than they like narrating, and so if you even offered them the option of narrating a result, ninety-nine times out of a hundred they'd just look at you like you'd suggested sticking their hand in a blender.<br/><br/>As a result, I can't even bring myself to agree with the "it depends on the game" crowd, because I honestly don't think it does.  It depends on the <i>people playing the game</i>.  Whatever they think is the most fun is the closest thing to a correct answer for them, and if a game's rules say "No, this other way is totally the best way and everyone playing should use it," they're just going to hate that game's rules and try to do it their own way anyway.

Regardless of the character succeeding, the player has a choice: do I narrate my outcome or memory?  The adversary for that character/player gets to narrate the other.<br/><br/>So, the player is always narrating something -- sometimes a success, sometimes a failure, and sometimes a memory which means someone else (which is in many ways the same as saying "the GM") narrates the outcome.  My point is that all three can co-mingle in the same game for great awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77491/#Comment_77491" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T11:54:25+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 11:54AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Verge, I separate winning/losing from narration rights, and there isn't a GM. That is, since the number of dice is what determines who wins or loses, the actual face value was free for other things. The highest face value got narration rights. That means that there are four combinations (win conflict + win narration, win conflict + lose narration, lose conflict + win narration, lose conflict + lose narration). There are sometimes trade-offs, too, such as when you choose a losing result on your dice to control narration.<br/><br/>Also, I don't think narration rights have to be absolute or in the hands of only one person. They can be shared. For example, in my game Hellball, the highest roller gets first narration and a sort of trump power. The second highest roller narrates next, but cannot override anything said by the first, and the first narrator can trump him. The third highest roller narrates after the second, but cannot override anything said by the first and second, but the first and second narrators can trump him. Etc. I call this "cascading narration rights." It gives everyone a say in a scene but structures it and distributes narrative authority in a formal way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77498/#Comment_77498" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T12:37:19+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 12:37PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, cascading narrative rights were something I was just whispering to Joshua about.

The potential separatude means that there can, and often is, multiple narrators resolving a given scene.  Person A took out the guards, person B got taken out by person C (while simultaneously working with persons C and D to open the safe) etc.  This is further convoluted by 'burning' which is a player literally sacrificing parts of their character for individual bits of narration.  It's mostly a winner narrates situation, and given the gambling feel of the game, works well for it.<br/><br/>In <b>Ensemble</b>, I have a. . . "narrator narrates" system, with a tacked-on Fact like system that needs fleshing out.  The basic idea is people get these Facts, which they can use to flavor the outcome - the outcome itself is determined by the winner, and the actual narrator is the guy who happens to roll the highest die (which generally isn't something that determined the 'winner' of the conflict).  PTA first edition had something similar, I think - there was the winner of the conflict (most odds rolled) and then there was the actual narrator (highest die rolled).  <br/><br/>I think neglecting this particular kind of organization leaves a big hole in the possibilities that could be considered -"GM narration vs. winner narrates vs. loser narrates" leaves out the idea that narration might be determined by some other process than determining success or failure.  And that brings us to the idea that conflict resolution might not necessarily be about "winning" vs. "losing" something in the first place.  If you have a game like THAT, how would you figure out who gets to narrate if you dont have a winner or a loser?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77507/#Comment_77507" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T13:16:56+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  1:16PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Are there any games that facilitate loser/winner narration while in-character?</blockquote>\nMy game "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries," which is being published this summer, does exactly this. The premise is that the characters are recounting the tale of an expedition to some far-off locale, so everything is narrated in the past tense, and both success or failure with respect to a particular hazard folds neatly into that with no need to break the stream of the tale. So the spotlight player gets to narrate both success or failure, though some failures trigger a scene that the whole group narrates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77630/#Comment_77630" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T20:38:55+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  8:38PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On cascading narration - in City of Masks, two players entering a conflict: <br/>1.

I prefer all different kinds of set ups depending on what I'm playing, but I like a system that gives everyone a chance to narrate. Just not for themselves. This is what we did in Panty Explosion and Classroom Deathmatch. Each player character has a best friend and rival. Best friend describes all of the characters successes. Rival describes all of her failures. In this case "describes" means both provides a flavorful description and determines the result of the succes or failure (including how itaffects other characters and the world and how it progresses the scene) with full authority. What this does is always involves at least 2 other playrs in any descision the first player makes. I like this alot. The first player still gets to describe her intent ("I hit want to convince my mom that it's okay if I date a Korean boy", or "I try to keep yoko from being devoured by the demon"), but narrative control beyond that rests with the people she's chosen as her best friend and rival.<br/><br/>But like other people have said, what works well for one game may not for another.

And in some cases and in some groups, it may not be a good idea to split that kind of responsibility among multiple people: not everyone wants the job of narration, and not everyone who <i>does</i> want that job is necessarily a person that the rest of the group thinks should have it.  And by the same token, there may also be a few people in a group who can really thrive when given the greater responsibility (and the additional control/authority/freedom that goes along with it) of being solely responsible for narration.  In terms of the pressure it places on individuals in the group and what they do with the power it gives them, sometimes an unequal distribution of responsibility is actually the best way to go. <br/><br/><br/>And what I see happening in our group is what I think is probably typical of most groups who favor "GM-only" narration...meaning that it's not exactly ALL GM-only, all the time.  At times, the GM will solicit contributions from the group or from a particular player, sometimes even explicitly passing the narration duties over to someone else entirely for a particular event or even an entire scene.  I tend to look at those moments as places where the GM is either offloading an unwanted responsibility on someone else who does want it, rewarding a player's interest in a particular event (usually prompted by the player overtly expressing a desire for it), or using it as a tool to bring distracted players back into the game.<br/><br/>In our group, GM-only narration has turned into a dynamic process that shifts to fit whatever the group's perceived needs are at any given moment, and at this point it's become a reliably fun method for us.  Our shared-narration attempts weren't nearly as responsive to the group's needs -- and really, how could they be, when we were just trying them for the first time and comparing them to techniques we'd worked out over years of play?<br/><br/>Ultimately, given the choice between something that had been working for years and something that some players weren't convinced would ever work for them (because they don't personally enjoy doing narration, or they don't enjoy the narration provided by someone else, or they prefer that there be one primary narrative authority providing a coherent overall vision for the story, or whatever)...well, it wasn't really much of a choice, and now shared narration is effectively off our gaming table.  It's not a big loss, honestly: I think there are only two, maybe three people in our group who'd have fun playing a game with shared narration, but even out of those, I think there's only one who might like it <i>better</i> than what we've got, and that's just because he likes GMing but doesn't have the stamina or free time to run a full-on campaign.  Getting to be "GM for a moment" several times a night gives him enough to scratch his itch without overtaxing him.<br/><br/><br/>It's a good idea and very useful to be exposed to the different systems, of course, but in the end every group's going to figure out its own tastes and go where they think the fun is, and god help anyone who thinks it's a good idea to argue with 'em about it. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

At times, the GM will solicit contributions from the group or from a particular player, sometimes even explicitly passing the narration duties over to someone else entirely for a particular event or even an entire scene. I tend to look at those moments as places where the GM is either offloading an unwanted responsibility on someone else who does want it, rewarding a player's interest in a particular event (usually prompted by the player overtly expressing a desire for it), or using it as a tool to bring distracted players back into the game.</blockquote>\nIn Passages, it's GM Narrates 99% of the time. However, the players get plot points they can expend to gain the right to narrate (and change a failed check into a successful one). This method works well in practice for the reasons you state. The "burden" of narration only falls to the player when they're "feeling it".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
