Some folks in that thread seemed keen on offering feedback, so that's what this thread is for. <br/><br/>I wish I had time to build something airtight from the ground up, but for now, I'm mostly cobbling this together from existing rules, moves, and stats. I just want to make sure I'm not breaking anything terribly when I do decide to tweak something major. The main sources I'm borrowing from include a couple other Mass Effect hacks, <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzUTkdniNXM1MHVFVVNKVEp4bFE/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse Effect</a> and <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6082.0" rel="nofollow">Mass Effect: Apocalypse</a>, as well as <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-regiment-colonial-marines.html" rel="nofollow">The Regiment: Colonial Marines</a>. Really, I could run any one of those, but I felt like tweaking things a bit and got bit by the design bug. <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks in advance for feedback. I'll comment again to ask some specific questions as they come up, but please also feel free to jump in with any random suggestion that you think ought to be in a Mass Effect game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415690/#Comment_415690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T15:25:27+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  3:25PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2013 3:25PM by JasonT.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I figure a good place to start is with just a general summary of the framework I've got in terms of stats, basic moves, and playbooks.<br/><br/><b>STATS</b><br/><br/>I'm using hard, cool, hot, and sharp basically unaltered. Maybe they could be renamed or rethought as something more Mass-Effect-sounding, and I'd certainly entertain suggestions, but I've kept them as-is so far because they seem to work fine and are familiar to my players. In general, hard is for fighting with weapons, cool is for biotic powers (given the emphasis on biotics' mental discipline in the lore), and sharp is for tech powers (given the emphasis on engineers' intelligence/cleverness in the lore). This means that biotic characters are also good at acting under fire, and tech characters are also good at finding and taking cover (originally "stay the fuck down" in AW, but I added some stuff here to make it something you're more likely to do with some frequency). Hot still does what you expect hot to do, with some moves cherry-picked from other games and renamed things that would be familiar to Mass Effect players (e.g., "Hypnotic" is now "Paramour").<br/><br/>I replaced weird with alien (see <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18449/apocalypse-world-hacks-weird-basic-move-alternatives#Item_30" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>). It's used for moves when you do something that makes you seem horribly alien to others, or when you do something that reminds you just how alien others are to you. Maybe that's not the best way to do double-duty, but I am happy with it so far. It has no basic move associated with it, but each species has a roll+alien move, and there are a few other moves scattered around. The most important is the healing move, <i>Medic</i>, which has you roll+cool (on your own species) or roll+alien (on another species).<br/><br/>I also replaced the term history (Hx) with loyalty (to slip in another Mass Effect reference), but otherwise it's mechanically unchanged.<br/><br/><b>PLAYBOOKS</b><br/><br/>Playbooks have a side A/side B approach. Side A is your class, showing stats, gear, and most of your moves, along with the other stuff you mark up during play (like harm). Side B is your species, with basic move text, species move, and a picture. All the species-specific stuff is on one page, and everything else is on another page, so you can just pick two pages, slap them together, and be good to go.<br/><br/>I couldn't decide whether I wanted the playbooks to just be the six standard classes from the video game, or whether I wanted to have some more flavor, so I decided to have my cake and eat it too. I'm making "core playbooks" for the standard six (Soldier, Adept, Engineer, Infiltrator, Vanguard, Sentinel) and "optional playbooks" for players who want a little more flavor and a little less combat built in (e.g., Broker, Pilot, Thief, Doctor, etc.).<br/><br/>I am cutting a LOT of powers from the Mass Effect games, mostly to preserve niche protection for the core playbooks. When I was throwing in just about every power in the game, the playbooks all felt like they were doing the same thing, and most of the moves basically boiled down to "kill dudes in marginally different ways," which looked really dull. Now that I've stripped things down, the classes are reminiscent of Mass Effect 1 in their diversity: The Soldier has reliable damage and durability at any range, at any moment; The Sentinel is durable and great at protecting others, but has little offensive power; The Adept is good at moving people around; and so on. <br/><br/>I'll post again shortly about moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415695/#Comment_415695" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T15:44:47+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  3:44PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2013 3:58PM by JasonT.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>BASIC MOVES</b><br/><br/>Act Under Fire, Read a Person, and Help or Interfere are unchanged. I might have gotten a bit overzealous with changes elsewhere, though, so let me know if you think I broke anything. <br/><br/>I overhauled Go Aggro and Seize by Force to remove some ambiguity that confuses some of my newer players. Now, if you're firing on somebody who's not ready for it, it's Open Fire (but you can still use this move to force them to do something without bloodshed, as with Go Aggro; it basically turns it into a 10+ roll on Seduce or Manipulate). If it's open combat, it's Trade Fire (almost identical to Seize by Force, but you choose fewer options so things don't get too confusing with all the bonus effects from powers and ammo mods).<br/><br/>As a side note: Looking at this, it might seem like you're equally effective in a fight with three different stats. I won't get into the details of this right now, but basically, you can't use biotic/tech powers every single move without messing yourself up pretty badly, and they don't do as much harm as guns. So, most of the time, these moves will be rolled+hard.\n<blockquote><b>Open Fire:</b> When you get the drop on someone, if you're fighting with\u2026<br/>\t\u2022\tweapons, roll+hard<br/>\t\u2022\tbiotics, roll+cool<br/>\t\u2022\ttech, roll+sharp<br/>On a 10+, you choose 1. On a 7\u20139, the GM chooses 1.<br/>\t\u2022\tYou hit. Apply harm and effects from your weapon/mod/power.<br/>\t\u2022\tYou graze them, but they know you mean business. Apply less than full harm. <br/>\t\u2022\tYou miss them. Call it a warning shot.<br/>If your target's still alive, now they choose 1:<br/>\t\u2022\tThey prepare for open combat.<br/>\t\u2022\tThey freeze. Treat as if you'd rolled a 10+ to <i>intimidate</i> them.<br/>\t\u2022\tThey hit the deck, flee, or barricade themselves in.<br/>On a miss, you blow your advantage; use <i>trade fire</i> instead if they shoot back. <br/><br/><b>Trade Fire:</b> When you engage in open combat, if you're fighting with\u2026<br/>\t\u2022\tweapons, roll+hard<br/>\t\u2022\tbiotics, roll+cool<br/>\t\u2022\ttech, roll+sharp<br/>On a hit, trade harm-for-harm as established by weapons or powers, and apply effects from powers or ammo mods. On a 10+, also choose 2; on a 7\u20139, choose 1:<br/>\t\u2022\tDamage (cause +1harm)<br/>\t\u2022\tDefense (suffer \u20131harm)<br/>\t\u2022\tControl (seize a person, place, or thing).<br/>\t\u2022\tImpress (inspire fear, outrage, respect, etc.)<br/>If you attack with a weapon or power that does no harm or only s-harm, don't pick damage.</blockquote>\nRead a Sitch is mostly unchanged, but I took out the +1 bonus for acting on answers (that's now its own move, like the Sergeant's Veteran's Instinct move from the Regiment Colonial Marines), and I added one option so the move can be used when scavenging, investigating a murder scene, or other kinds of stories:\n<blockquote><b>Read a Situation</b> When you read a situation or examine your environment, roll+sharp. (...)<br/>\t\u2022\tDo I see any evidence of ____?<br/></blockquote>\nSeduce or Manipulate has been renamed Charm or Intimidate (a reference back to the games). I reworded it a little to get around some confusion among my players. It's functionally identical, though ... I think.\n<blockquote><b>Charm or Intimidate:</b> When you try to charm or intimidate someone, tell them what you want and roll+hot. On a hit, NPCs will do what you want if you offer something to help persuade them (e.g., a sincere argument, an even trade, a believable lie, a credible threat). On a 10+, you can make good on your offer later (or not, if you prefer). On a 7\u20139, they need some proof right now that your offer is genuine. When you use this move on PCs, on a 10+, both; on a 7\u20139, choose 1:<br/>\t\u2022\tif they do it, they mark experience;<br/>\t\u2022\tif they refuse, it's acting under fire.<br/>What they do then is up to them.<br/></blockquote>\nThis next one is actually an optional move, but I figure I should throw it in because Session End doesn't make sense without it...\n<blockquote><b>Interrupt:</b> Once per session, you may do one of the following when you roll: <br/>\t\u2022\tWhen you show great heroism, honor, or compassion, roll+paragon instead of another stat. Gain +1paragon after the roll. <br/>\t\u2022\tWhen you're a total badass, doing whatever damage you must to get the job done, roll+renegade instead of another stat. Gain +1renegade after the roll. <br/>If paragon or renegade reaches +4, reset it to +1 and mark xp.<br/></blockquote>\nAnd finally...\n<blockquote><b>Session End:</b> At the end of every session, choose at least 1, up to all 3:<br/>\t\u2022\tSomebody knows you better than before. Tell them to take +1loyalty with you.<br/>\t\u2022\tSomebody did something really heroic. Tell them to take +1paragon.<br/>\t\u2022\tSomebody did something really badass. Tell them to take +1renegade.<br/>If anyone's paragon, renegade, or loyalty reaches +4, they reset it to +1 and mark xp.</blockquote>\nI'll post about other moves and stuff sometime later on. That seems like more than enough of me being wordy as hell for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415700/#Comment_415700" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T17:23:51+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  5:23PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2013 5:30PM by zircher.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "It's used for moves when you do something that makes you seem horribly alien to others, or when you do something that reminds you just how alien others are to you."<br/><br/>Mainly for thematic sake, what about renaming Alien to Renegade?

(And I do think they describe different things, don't they? Being a renegade is about being an intimidating badass. Being alien is about feeling or seeming different from other people.)<br/><br/>I'm considering the possibility of axing both alien and hot to just use paragon and renegade the way they're used in the Apocalypse Effect hack (linked in the first post). In that hack, paragon and renegade basically replace both hot and weird, but they can be raised/lowered during play. The big drawback with that, though, is that I kind of want players to be able to design a "hot" character who is <i>always</i> good in social situations, the same way you can make a character who's always good in a fight. That's why I was thinking of doing those stats as more ancillary...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Akchizar" title="Akchizar"><img alt="Akchizar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/407/nK0KWE2DNMA2X.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Akchizar">Akchizar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415707/#Comment_415707" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T20:10:23+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  8:10PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JasonT">@JasonT</a> Maybe <b>alien</b> is also a measure of how much you embrace/grok the alien-ness of the galaxy now that humanity's one of many advanced species?

I wonder if that should be its own move made from scratch, a conditional stat-substitution move for Charm or Intimidate (Seduce or Manipulate), or just built right into Charm or Intimidate ("... roll+hot (for your own species) or +alien (for another species)"). Right now, most of the +alien moves I have are just species moves, but I have some others floating around...<br/><br/><br/><b>+ALIEN MOVES</b><br/><br/><b>Medic:</b> When you attend to an injury, roll+cool (if it's someone of your own species) or +alien (if it's someone of another species). On 10+, choose 2; on 7\u20139, choose 1:<br/>\t\u2022\tStabilize them without needing to spend medi-gel.<br/>\t\u2022\tHeal them (or yourself) 1 health per medi-gel spent.<br/>\t\u2022\tEveryone in your squad spends 1 medi-gel and heals 1 health, triggered remotely.<br/>\t\u2022\tThey regain consciousness and get back in the fight (provided they have some health).<br/><br/><b>Unique Ability:</b> When you draw on your strange talent, roll+alien. On a 10+, it works safely and effectively. On a 7\u20139, it works, but you strain yourself or freak people out; take \u20131 forward. On a miss, it doesn't work as intended, or it does work but you're stunned, harmed, or out of control. When you choose this move, define your ability, where it comes from, and its downside. Examples from Mass Effect include:<br/>\t\u2022\tTouching a Prothean beacon led to visions, but they're vague and disorienting.<br/>\t\u2022\tSuffering mind control led to a psychic link with others like you, but you're never really alone in your own mind anymore.<br/>\t\u2022\tCybernetic implants augmented you physically, but you're not sure if you're even in control of your own mind anymore.<br/><br/><b>Xenoscience:</b> When you dedicate yourself to a project involving alien artifacts or specimens, roll+alien. On a 10+, you can do it, but it has a cost or risk determined by the GM. On a 7\u20139, it has multiple costs or risks. Costs/risks might include resources, time, materials (on hand or otherwise), and/or danger. On a miss, by the time you figure out what the risks were, it's too late.<br/><br/><b>(Asari) Embrace Eternity:</b> When you meld your mind with someone else's, roll+alien. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7\u20139, hold 1. While you\u2019re joined, spend hold 1-for-1 to ask questions:<br/>\t\u2022\tWhat was your lowest or highest moment?<br/>\t\u2022\tFor what do you crave forgiveness, and of whom?<br/>\t\u2022\tWhat are your secret pains or joys?<br/>\t\u2022\tWhat do you hold closest to your heart?<br/>\t\u2022\tWhat truth is your mind hiding from you? (GM may also answer for a player.)<br/>If this was an intimate exchange between PCs, both gain +1loyalty with the  other.<br/><br/><b>(Batarian) Raider:</b> When you give a non-batarian an order or a warning, roll+alien. On a hit, they choose:<br/>\t\u2022\tThey accept your order/warning.<br/>\t\u2022\tThey freeze.<br/>\t\u2022\tThey back away, hands where you can see them.<br/>\t\u2022\tThey attack you.<br/>On a 10+, take +1 forward against them as well. On a miss, they do what they like and you take \u20131 forward against them.<br/><br/><b>(Drell) Relived Memories:</b> When you relive a memory, roll+alien. On a hit, describe what you remember as if reading hastily scrawled notes from your subconscious. On a 10+, the GM will add details that would be helpful to your current situation. On a 7\u20139, the GM may add extraneous details; it's up to you to make them useful. On a miss, you get lost in your memories.<br/><br/><b>(Human) First Contact:</b> When you're touched by something truly alien for the first time, roll+alien. On a 10+, you get all 4 below. On a 7\u20139, choose 3. <br/>\t\u2022\tIt leaves you with an ability you didn't have before.<br/>\t\u2022\tIt causes you no immediate harm.<br/>\t\u2022\tIt leaves no permanent visible mark upon you.<br/>\t\u2022\tIt leaves you in full control of yourself.<br/>On a miss, the GM chooses 2 for you.<br/><br/><b>(Krogan) Rage:</b> When harm reduces your health, roll+alien\u2013harm instead of making the harm move. On a 10+, the pain just makes you angry; take +1 now to trade fire. On a 7\u20139, you lose your footing, lose your grip, lose track of something, or miss noticing something (GM chooses 1). On a miss, the GM can choose one of the aforementioned options for \u20131harm.<br/><br/><b>(Quarian) Scavenger:</b> When you need some small object, roll+alien. On 10+, you have just the thing. On 7\u20139, you have something pretty close, so long as it isn't too high-tech. On a miss, you used to have it, but it's sold, stolen, or busted.<br/><br/><b>(Salarian) Hyperactive Metabolism:</b> When you need to do something quickly, roll+alien. On a hit, you can do it in half the expected time, and non-salarians can't roll to interfere with you. On a 7\u20139, you still act fast, but non-salarians can't follow what you're doing well enough to roll to aid or follow through for you.<br/><br/><b>(Turian) Duty &amp; Honor:</b> When you help a teammate who's making a roll, you may roll+alien instead of making the help or interfere move. On a hit, they take +2 now. On a 7\u20139, you also expose yourself to fire, danger, retribution, or cost.

Maybe I'll take another look at some more dialog-oriented hacks for inspiration...<br/><br/>(Edit to add, as I look around: You know, the arrangement described above actually does mirror Mass Effect video games, but maybe more than I'd like. The games have gotten more combat-focused over the years, with less and less emphasis on dialog \u2013 and where dialog does have actual game mechanics, it's handled entirely by charm/intimidate, interrupts, and squad loyalty, all of which I tried to account for. Um, and getting xp for adding stuff for your codex when you ask volus diplomats about their culture, I guess. But I do want to focus on more than just fighting, so maybe there's a way to translate other stuff that is memorable from ME social interaction...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415713/#Comment_415713" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T01:08:35+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  1:08AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Especially 3 had much less focus on dialogue. But here's what I have to say about that: What's <i>memorable</i> about the Mass Effect games? What made 'em special? The combat was fun, and dialogue in games is hard to make <i>fun</i> (often interesting, but not often fun - as a side note, I credit Deus Ex Human Revolution for being one of the only games I've ever played that pulled off a legitimately fun gameplay experience from talking). That said, I think that for a lot of people, aside from a few particular major setpieces, the plot, setting, and character interaction is significantly more memorable than the combat. In a hack, it's those elements of Mass Effect I think are best to see. It's also HARD. Remember that not every element of the games needs to appear in a hack, just the things you think are really important.<br/>Basically the issue was the games had a thematic message of talking as much as you shoot, but the gameplay experience didn't really support that message all the time.<br/><br/>Looking at other dialogue-based games certainly might help, but I think that I wouldn't really want too much mechanization of conversation. Monsterhearts (my go-to dialogue-based hack) does a pretty good deal of mechanizing conversation because it sees a lot more talking than direct action, but Mass Effect has its share of both. Tough to think about.<br/>Here's what I've been thinking about through the day: are Charm and Intimidate already kinda like Manipulate and Go Aggro, respectively? They kinda are from where I'm standing. They're how you get things done in a conversation - one by bribing and persuasion, the other by threats. The difference I see most apparently is that Shepard never was forced to follow through on Intimidate threats because the games usually only provided you the option to do it if it would be successful. Cuz Intimidate doesn't really work with the existing structure of Seduce/Manipulate.<br/><br/>Other thoughts:<br/>The Alien stat. I'm tripping over your use of it a bit. In a lot of ways, your use of it is very much tied to the idea of things actually being literally aliens. However, in *-World games, the Stats are almost <i>always</i> adjectives that describe the <i>personality</i> of the character, not the physical truth of their being. This is what I was getting at in the last thread that sometimes humans are more alien than the aliens themselves, and aliens being more human than some humans. Making the moves with Alien trigger almost exclusively over things literally about species, with Unique Ability basically being the only one where being a different species doesn't actually matter to the move. This is why I think that Biotics are a great thing to go under Alien. Alien may not mean psychic, but psychic stuff definitely separates you from baseline humanity. (plus at this point I don't really buy Biotics as Cool <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> )<br/>For example, I totally get why you have it so Alien matters with Medic. However, I disagree. Our stats are about OUR personalities. Why would me being all weird and different from humanity make me good at healing other species - not everyone is different from humanity in the same ways. Maybe it makes sense that a pretty out-there tech-head Quarian could do good healing for a human with cyber-implants, but how does a Krogan being all crazy and nothing like us help us heal other <i>humans,</i> since he would be triggered into using that stat for the roll. (also about Medic, Cool is already pretty commonly used cuz Act Under Fire is the catch-all move and is only somewhat appropriate for the move, Sharp might make more sense)<br/>Do you kinda get where I'm going with this? Taking advantage of the stuff that makes me different is Alien, but working on stuff different than me isn't. If being different made me good at everything different, that kinda lumps everything together to me.<br/>Of course, this can make it a bit harder to use Alien as a stat sometimes. But I think the thematic power is worth it.<br/><br/>So, the class/species thing. That ain't bad, not at all. I do think, however, that you lose some interesting design space. Two things.<br/>1) Options. If you're splitting Species off into its own page, give each species choices to make. There ain't just one form for each species, gives lists of options. Maybe most of the Look and Name choices go on the species chart, with maybe clothing stuff going more to the Job chart. Also, give multiple move choices. Maybe everyone gets the same move for sure, or maybe only one to start with at all, but give some additional ones if someone wants to mechanically expand on the specialties of their species instead of their job. I mean, not all Krogan are alike after all - Wrex and Grunt would have different move selections, even though job-wise they would be very similar. Even Samara and Morinth would play very differently species, while job-wise they would be almost literally identical.<br/>2) Here's a different path: look at Dungeon World's handling of races. You see, as it is you have one thing that all members of a species start with, and that might not be helpful to their job selection. DW did it so that you picked a race as just another option on the playbook, giving you a move. Thing is, if you picked a Halfing Thief or Fighter or whatever it gave you different Halfling-related moves to keep them relevant. This path would immediately make it possible for their species move to be relevant. Yeah, you wouldn't have every species available for every job, but if you're gonna be an Adept, you're probably not gonna be a Krogan, and if you're gonna be a Vanguard, you're probably not gonna be a Volus.<br/>I prefer that first approach now though, having written this.<br/>Also, I'm not sure it's really a great idea to split the classes into more-or-less "combat" and "non-combat" and then call the non-combat ones optional. Sorta sends a weird message. Remember that playbooks are the archetypes of the genre, the types of characters whose adventures we care about. The ones you came up for the "optional" ones are probably Playbooks. The Pilot, The Doctor, The Scientist, The Big-Guns Guy, The Ex-Cop, The Disciplined Soldier, The Assassin. What archetypes are really important to the universe? Cuz I gotta say, when I see Wrex I don't say "Vanguard" and when I look at Liara I don't say "Adept", even if that's true.<br/><br/>So where's the Hanar move? I can't play Blasto if I can't be a Hanar! (I'm, um, <i>mostly</i> kidding)<br/><br/>Paragon/Renegade! Tough thing. The big thing I notice is that, by wording, Paragon is for heroic stuff and Renegade is for badass stuff. Pretty true to the games, but, trouble is, those things aren't really mutually exclusive. Can you be BOTH? I'd kinda recommend looking at a sliding-scale stat similar to The Angel in Monsterhearts, that could have cool ideas in it. <br/><br/>Oh, and one other thing you just mentioned: "getting xp for adding stuff for your codex when you ask volus diplomats about their culture, I guess." That's probably a dumb idea to go much further with, for a few reasons. a) It's easily abusable for xp, b) it doesn't bring the fiction anywhere, it's just a standstill for an infodump that, face it, the players are probably just doing to get xp, and c) it puts the MC (GM?) on the spot, which sucks, especially if they feel like they don't want to contradict established lore but aren't knowledgable themselves.<br/>Honestly I think the "Shepard asks stuff or finds open infodumps on computers about the societies of the galaxy" thing was kind of a blunt tool Bioware was using to get the exposition out in the open while still optional. Asking about this stuff was never the memorable stuff of the games, even if the information itself was, so see if you can't find a more organic or fun behavior to reward.<br/><br/>I'm done for now I think. This is all just musing, take what you want from it, a real ME hack is just something I'd care to see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415714/#Comment_415714" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T01:32:10+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  1:32AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2013 2:02AM by Cneph.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think horn_head_o makes some very good points.  <br/>Some specific thoughts (though I broadly agree with the main points):<br/><br/>I also don't buy Biotics as Cool.  <br/>I do like Orlando's Hope stat idea from the previous thread and think its very appropriate (as a sub for cool or weird/alien, perhaps?)

Lot to digest in here. I'm going to go back through it and think about this when I have a bit more time, but a couple quick reactions right off the bat:<br/><br/>BIOTICS: I am surprised to hear people not buying biotics as cool; it seemed like the totally obvious choice to me. There's so much emphasis in the lore (including expanded stuff, like books and codex) on biotics needing to condition themselves for self-control, and the biotic characters in game are usually either cool-as-a-cucumber types (Kaidan, Miranda, Liara) or "I will destroy you!" types. (For the latter, I had a move called "Nemesis," which is a stat-substitution allowing you to use +hard instead of +cool for biotics in combat, and prevents needing to act under fire for using biotics in combat.) I'll think on it, though. It definitely is an "alien" thing from a human perspective. <br/><br/>ALIEN: I do want to fit in more with alien being an adjective to describe personality, not just a noun to describe species, but I haven't put a lot of work into it. Moving biotics over there definitely would sweep a lot of moves into that category all of a sudden, if leaving cool somewhat empty. Also, fair point on Medic, especially with that krogan example. (I took cool directly from The Regiment in that case, though, and I'm definitely short on +cool moves compared to +sharp moves...)<br/><br/>HOPE: I dig the concept behind this as a stat. I also have a major pet peeve against mixing "noun" stats with "adjective" stats. I definitely prefer adjectives for the core things about you that don't change very often (hard, sharp, cool, alien), but I'm pretty comfortable using nouns for stuff that is more like a changing resource (history/loyalty, paragon, renegade). Does that make sense?<br/><br/>HOT: I can see this both ways \u2013 not just as "sexy hot" but like "that Shepard is hot shit" (a very strange turn of phrase now that I actually see it written down) \u2013\xa0but honestly, I'm mostly using this as a placeholder until some other term occurs to me that seems more appropriate, if ever. (I've used "smooth" elsewhere, but that seems more suited for lying and manipulation than the force-of-will kind of persuasion you associate with ME protagonists.)<br/><br/>ANGEL: Never seen the playbook. Will have to take a look.<br/><br/>PLAYBOOKS: Yeah, I totally need to rename "core" versus "optional" playbooks, and I knew it even before I posted. I actually really like the idea of species getting more options than just "what species are you," but I know I'm already pushing it (at least with some of my players) with making too many customization options up front. I'll think on it, though. I do actually have two moves for each species (the other not requiring a stat), and figured everybody would get both. (Like, asari get the "biotic aptitude" move, allowing them to take biotic powers, regardless of class.) Maybe I could work some customization into that somehow.<br/><br/>HANAR/ELCOR: Two of my players already pointed out their absence. I didn't include them because (a) I was borrowing from two hacks and three video games that didn't include them as playable characters, (b) I honestly don't understand how they move and interact with the world enough to confidently handle them, and (c) I worry about my players just picking them for comic relief. Maybe someday. Not today.<br/><br/>CODEX: Yeah, I totally agree on all counts. I was mostly throwing that in as a gag. If I ever try to make mechanics for needless exposition, please stop me, I've gone too far.<br/><br/>... Man, so much for "a couple quick reactions." You see what I mean about "the design bug"?

I figured some people would be fine if just told, "You need to wait a bit between using powers," but in cases of ambiguity (or where you're willing to take a risk), I made an optional move that works kind of like the harm move.\n<blockquote><b>Cooldown:</b> When you attempt to use your powers without resting or taking cover in between, roll+cooldown. On a hit, you can let the power fail, or you can let the GM choose consequences based on your roll:<br/>10+: You suffer momentary stunning, backlash (1-harm AP/SP), or 2 from below.<br/>7\u20139: The strain leaves you exhausted, exposed, vulnerable, or disoriented.<br/></blockquote>\nYour cooldown score is 0 if you're just in street clothes; weapons and armor each add a bit (like +1 for a pistol, +2 for heavy armor, etc.). (And in case it's not obvious "SP" is the tag for "shield piercing.")<br/><br/>Is this too damn fiddly, even as an optional move, or do you think it does well enough in capturing what makes using tech/biotic powers feel special and tough to pull off?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415743/#Comment_415743" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T15:39:58+00:00" title="June  8, 2013  3:39PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2013 4:12PM by Cneph.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess there is always Hopeful, if you are set on adjectives.

Seems to me many of the shipboard conversations and personal side quests are about Shepard boosting the hopes (and thereby also gaining the loyalty) of the crew, which directly impacts their survival chances by giving them something to live for, maybe not just fight and die for.<br/><br/>Cooldown, while a bit fiddly, could be in the optional moves section, to be pulled in situationally.  But, could you have a Cooldown/Overheated countdown clock instead?  Then some of the choices the biotic/tech moves offer can influence the amount of cooldown they add.  Your move as written implies that each use of a tech/biotic move is a single use of the <i>power</i>.  In the way that Seize by force isn't necessarily just one gunshot, maybe you wind up having to use overload a couple times to get your desired result?  Something to think about, perhaps.  It may be that the right thing to do is ask for a roll on each power activation.<br/><br/>+worldly moves might be around dealing with and adapting to people, things and circumstances outside your experience and worldview, including the truely alien.

I suppose advances could increase the sum to one-sum...<br/><br/>Edited because I like this idea better, drawing on several posts by others:<br/><br/>There is one <i>when you browbeat or requisition move</i> (jk).  Seems to me that the way that works in ME seems pretty similar to these *W manipulate moves- the grey, middle option requires leverage or back-scratching, like getting them an in with the Asari diplomat.  The Paragon and Renegade options, appealing to their better natures or survival instinct sometimes let you get the same result without the fetch quest.  So, you can spend a point of Paragon or Renegade to act as Leverage for the manipulate move.  Or maybe just +1 on the roll, if we take <a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone%27s">@Johnstone's</a> points about 'some not-leverage thing' always counting as leverage to apply in this case- though this isn't always, it's a spend.<br/><br/>In this case, if you still want the occasional custom move to roll +paragon, then maybe Paragon and Renegade are pools that work a bit like Strings, and a bit like Hx, staying between 1 and 3, when they roll around, you mark xp.  You get points for doing heroic or badass things, the end of session awards, etc.<br/>Then you can have initial choices that establish starting Paragon and Renegade, like the Hx questions and spacer/survivor backgrounds.<br/><br/>Some moves can have 'pick another bad collateral damage 7-9 option to gain a point of Renegade'.  And 'pick another personal sacrifice 7-9 option to gain a point of Paragon'.  Defy the odds / act under fire might fit this construct.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415777/#Comment_415777" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T05:15:18+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  5:15AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is moving in a wonderful direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415779/#Comment_415779" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T06:51:35+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  6:51AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PARAGON/RENEGADE INSIDE MOVES: Hmm, I'm not sure I follow exactly what you're suggesting in that last post, but I'm hoping to tease that idea out a bit more. Leaving custom moves aside for a moment, you're suggesting that even basic moves could have options for paragon/renegade gain built into them, yes? (It's an interesting idea, though I wonder if I want players to have to keep marking their sheets that frequently.) And can I ask you to clarify what you mean in the "some not-leverage thing" sentence?<br/><br/>ANGEL-STYLE PARAGON/RENEGADE: Just checked out the Monsterhearts Angel playbook. It's neat! But it's not clear to me what we'd gain by having +paragon and +renegade zero-sum like that. In fact, one of my favorite things about the video games was that you could gain points in one without necessarily losing points in the other. Not that I want to be slavishly devoted to the games, of course \u2013\xa0but I feel like moving between paragon/renegade on a slider feels more like painful D&amp;D alignment changes than ... well, anything in Mass Effect.<br/><br/>So, picture this: Somebody finally gets up to +3 renegade, and the story gives them a great, in-character opportunity to do something compassionate or heroic. This is how I ran one ME character, personally: She was basically an asshole to everybody and had a habit of kicking guys out of windows, but whenever it came time to save innocent lives, she always tried to do "the right thing." In a game with a sliding paragon/renegade scale, she'd actually be <i>penalized</i> in one of her stats for that until she decides to consistently move back toward paragon, wouldn't she? This makes great sense in the MH Angel playbook, where the character is actively and intentionally built around a theme of internal struggle. It makes less sense for Mass Effect heroes, who can have their badassery and eat it too. I suppose you could try to have a system like ME3's, where your persuasion attribute is your reputation, and paragon/renegade just offer flavor for how you get to use that stat, but it seems like a lot of work to think that through without any obvious gain in gameplay (at least to me).<br/><br/>HOT-ALTERNATIVES: I was wondering about strong too, but I worried that people would really need to retrain their ear to remember how it works. As it is, I'm already wary about hot because my wife keeps thinking it refers to "hot-headed" and figures that Urdnot Wrex probably has the highest hot score in the game. (Though, actually, I guess maybe he does ... he IS a respected leader and in high demand among the ladies of Tuchanka ... but I digress.)<br/><br/>I wonder sometimes if it'd make sense to just use nouns for stats (force/poise/wits/presence?), but I haven't been able to pinpoint yet why this bugs me in some hacks and not in others. (Seems fine in Ghost Lines, for instance, but rankles me elsewhere...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415780/#Comment_415780" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T06:59:49+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  6:59AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Foe Renegade/Paragon....

Inventing, codifying and testing another 6+ sets of unique (<i>good, worthwhile</i>) moves based on Paragon and Renegade for each playbook feels like it's heading into labour of love territory, or it would for me at least, when IMO it's not necessary for genre emulation- as I recall, Paragon/Renegade scores were most frequently relevant in conversation trees providing additional options.  Does the game need separate moves, by playbook, for the occasional 'shoot the kidnapper in the head' vs 'talk them down' "Quick-Time Event" scenes?  They'd be more like a custom move the MC whipped up specially for the set-piece or scene with P. and R. (Px and Rx?) choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415834/#Comment_415834" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T20:14:37+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  8:14PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2013 8:32PM by JasonT.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be perfectly honest, my take is this: I welcome and appreciate every suggestion made here. But of course, I won't be able to implement the vast majority of them myself for just the reason Cneph notes \u2013\xa0only so many hours in a day to devote to personal projects right now. I'm probably going to cobble something together from somewhere in between "most exciting suggestions" and "most doable suggestions, time permitting."<br/><br/>As for paragon/renegade: I do like the idea of paragon and renegade stuff being represented by actual moves rather than the once-per-session stat-substitution I proposed above, so I'm probably going to make separate "paragon interrupt" and "renegade interrupt" moves inspired by that suggestion. I don't think I'll have time to come up with good, robust, unique moves for every single playbook, though, especially considering that I'm still not entirely happy with my ideas on how to handle some of the most basic stuff that <i>needs</i> to get sorted out first (like biotics). You know?<br/><br/>Edit: What I came up with...<br/><br/>Once per session, when you show great heroism or compassion, roll+paragon. On a hit, choose 1:<br/>\t\u2022\tSave someone from harm.<br/>\t\u2022\tConvince an NPC to do the right thing (as if rolling 10+ to charm).<br/>On a 7\u20139, you may also open yourself up to harm, cost, or later repercussions. On a miss, gain +1paragon. If paragon reaches +4, reset it to +1 and mark experience.<br/><br/>Once per session, when you do whatever it takes to get the job done, roll+renegade. On a hit, choose 1:<br/>\t\u2022\tKill an NPC.<br/>\t\u2022\tUse fear or force to get your way (as if rolling 10+ to intimidate).<br/>On a 7\u20139, you may also allow harm to come to someone or something else in the process. On a miss, gain +1renegade. If renegade reaches +4, reset it to +1 and mark experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415837/#Comment_415837" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T20:30:30+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  8:30PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2013 8:32PM by Cneph.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The choice to Manipulate vs Go Aggro could be seen as getting to the heart of Paragon vs Renegade already.

Didn't see that edit with the moves or Cneph's latest post, just for context while readin' this wall of text.<br/><br/>NOTE: I know you won't get to most of this stuff, but it's good thinking material anyway. So consider most of this hypothetical, as if you were making The Big ME-World Hack rather than the small campaign material. What you have is fine for a few sessions of play, I just like talking about the ideal.<br/><br/>Well, I see your justification for Biotics as Cool, but I think that there are enough exception cases to make it a weird thing. As you said earlier, you intend to have a stat-substitution move that switches it around to cover exception cases (like Jack, who is very not-Cool but still a very strong biotic), but I kinda feel that's a weak solution. Aside from a personal distaste for stat substitution, it would probably need to be present on several playbooks to cover it, like any Biotic playbook.<br/>I mean, even the Asari we see using biotics, while they're often come and collected and self-disciplined, show emotion and major exertion from performing actual biotics. That's just my own experience. While self-discipline is important to a biotic's life and ability to live normally, I'm not so sure that the calmness and staying cool under pressure are the important factors when actually <i>using</i> biotics. There's definitely wiggle room here, and Cool is fine if you go that way (there's nothing <i>wrong</i> with it) but I just have a hard time seeing it thematically.<br/>As for trying to get more +Cool stuff, <i>don't worry</i>. Act Under Fire is the most versatile move in the game, and is really important to everyone. You can get away with low Hot if you aren't very social, you can get away with low Hard if you keep your head down in combat, and knowing the Sitch is often just gravy. However, everyone is going to do things under pressure - the wide phrasing of the trigger means that it's universally important. So don't worry about not having many +Cool moves, the game's got you covered. For an interesting evidence, count the +Cool moves in Apocalypse World - other than AUF, there's three, and they're all on the Operator. I wouldn't concern yourself with giving a larger selection of Cool moves <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I get how front-loading with options would be a trouble with playbooks, but I'm not entirely thinking MORE options, just having them more distributed. Here's an interesting angle: For names, give actual name suggestions on the Species side, but give Monsterhearts-style "types of names" on the Job, or vice-versa. (if you don't know MH's thing, they give you a pile of names, and then some prompts like "a gender-neutral name, a freaky name, a proud name"). While ApW has 5 Look options, maybe put three on the Species and 2 on the Job or something.<br/>And even if you just give those Species moves right off the bat without it being a choice, maybe offer up a couple additional ones that you can't get to start with but you can take with later improvements if you want to develop that. No more choices to start with, but some freedom later. That could be some work though, even for just two more moves on each.<br/><br/>Like I said, mostly kidding about the Hanar thing, not including them is the smart move.  Besides, Blasto wouldn't hang around with all those other losers anyway - until Blasto 6 of course.<br/><br/>So here's my thing about Paragon/Renegade. Yeah, in the games it's not a zero-sum game, but from my own experience I think it plays like one. In 80% of the situations in the game, when you're presented with the chance to do something Paragon, you could also do it Renegade, and not always picking one side or the other would make you kinda inferior at both. <br/>I think it avoids the D&amp;D alignment slider because it's not really about morality, it's about attitude. You can be compassionate, or you can be a hardass, but either way you're Good and you're a hero.<br/>But yes, you're right that it penalizes acting differently then your character normally would. But doesn't that kinda make sense?<br/>Here's what I've got bouncing in my head: Paragon/Renegade aren't about your attitude. Your attitude is a set thing - you're kind and helpful or you're a no-nonsense badass or whatever your attitude is, it's set. It's not like by doing more compassionate things you're becoming a kinder person; it goes the other direction, from being to doing. What IS changing is your reputation for being one of those things. I think this models the games well, and I think ME3 was smart for bringing the word in, because that's what your P/R seems to have meant from the beginning is how well you're known for that type of behavior. ME3 modeled how well-known you were as a whole, while the previous games modeled how well-known you were for being P or R. Yeah, new dialogue options unlocked with higher values, but I think that's more on the gameplay abstraction side of things.<br/>So if P/R in the games is a reputation thing, is it even treated like a stat? Are P/R a function of (Hot Replacement) and Hard, perhaps? Maybe just treat it like Reputation and have specific Paragon/Renegade stuff be moves, either basic (like you're thinkin' now, though I'm still a tad iffy myself, but w/e - the P/R story isn't the one I'd want to tell in an ME game personally) or playbook? Could "When you inspire your comrades through compassion or determination..." be the playbook's Special move (cuz sex moves probs aren't appropriate)?<br/>In fact, is P/R a thing for every playbook? If you had a playbook for a guy who was, like, The Leader or The Captain or something, maybe he's the one who gets P/R stuff as a schtick. <br/><br/>I'm just speculatin'. Food for thought and all. I'm sure the things you draw together for the game will be cool regardless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415839/#Comment_415839" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T20:35:57+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  8:35PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The choice to Manipulate vs Go Aggro could be seen as getting to the heart of Paragon vs Renegade already.

Talking about how "zoomed-in" combat moves are has got me wondering if I should be rethinking my approach.<br/><br/><b>Current (zoomed-in) approach: </b><br/><br/>1) Violence moves (go aggro/seize by force or equivalent) are roll+hard for weapons, roll+sharp for tech, roll+alien for biotics.<br/><br/>2) Powers (each its own move) can be used as weapons in violence moves, and are treated as if rolling for go aggro/seize by force equals one use of said power on a single target or area. Examples:<br/><br/><i>Pull:</i> Biotic power. When you attack someone with a biotic pull (0-harm close seek), on a hit, an unshielded target is momentarily disabled while yanked toward you in the air.<br/><br/><i>Sabotage:</i> Tech power. When you use your omni-tool to sabotage tech, on a hit, pick 1:<br/>\t\u2022\tan enemy's gun backfires (1-harm close shock) and must be reloaded;<br/>\t\u2022\ta vehicle malfunctions, moving erratically;<br/>\t\u2022\ta synthetic frenzies, attacking indiscriminately.<br/><br/>3) If you attack someone with powers too often, you may be asked by the GM to roll+cooldown to check whether you're exhausted/strained.<br/><br/>I wonder if this does not play as well to the kind of combat Apocalypse World's violence moves encourages, which is generally pretty fast and loose, not bogged down in minutiae. Should I be thinking more along the lines of what the other Mass Effect hacks have done, or even broader? Consider....<br/><br/><b>An alternate (zoomed-out) approach:</b><br/><br/>1) Violence moves (go aggro/seize by force or equivalent) are always roll+hard.<br/><br/>2) Powers (each its own move) can be used as weapons in violence moves, but you wouldn't declare "I'm attacking with pull"; instead, you'd get permanent extra options added to seize by force, as if rolling for go aggro/seize by force potentially equals multiple exchanges of gunfire, biotics, and/or tech. Examples:<br/><br/><i>Pull:</i> Biotic power. Add this to the options you can select when you seize by force:<br/>\u2022\xa0You yank someone without shields into the air for several seconds (0-harm close seek).<br/><br/><i>Sabotage:</i> Tech power. Add these to the options you can select when you seize by force:<br/>\u2022\xa0Cause enemy weapons to malfunction (cause +1harm, suffer \u20131harm).<br/>\u2022\xa0Synthetic targets are momentarily frenzied (cause +1harm, suffer \u20131harm).<br/><br/>3) Cooldown/power recharge would be ignored entirely, or strain effects might be added as a penalty on a low roll on seize by force.<br/><br/><br/>...

That's a Mass Effect/Apocalypse World hack that's already done, and that already has unique playbooks like "the human specialist" (e.g., Kelly Chambers) in addition to the familiar combat classes from the video games. <br/><br/>As for doing tech/biotics powers as if they are each weapons: Don't you think that would make combat feel even more zoomed-in? (Mind you, that's precisely what all my tech and biotic power moves look like right now, but after the above comments about my redone violence moves being too focused on the small picture, I was considering rewriting them all!) In contrast, having powers add options to <i>seize by force</i> means you can pick multiple options on a successful roll, potentially mixing weapons fire, maneuvering, and/or multiple powers in a single move. It feels like that might make fights go a bit quicker, especially with the extra harm soaked up by shields/barriers. Both ME/AW hacks linked in my first post have examples of both powers-as-weapons and powers-as-seize-options, in case you'd like to see how others have approached this issue. I'm having a hard time deciding what I like best. Maybe they're on the right track by using different approaches for different moves (e.g., warp as a weapon, but throw as a seize-option).<br/><br/>As for harm/shields: I was planning on doing harm "boxes" instead of countdown clocks (cf. The Regiment), doing armor the same as in Apocalypse World (1-armor for light, 2-armor for heavy), and keeping shield values very low by default (1-shield or 2-shield before powers that boost shields). If you take harm, it comes off your shields first, then your armor gets subtracted, then anything left over harms health directly. Shields replenish at the end of a fight, or if you use the <i>take cover</i> move (stay the fuck down, in AW parlance).<br/><br/>I am not planning on making a mechanical distinction between biotic barriers and shields from a shield generator (like in terms of bonus damage from warp or concussive shot specifically to barriers and not shields). It's fine for a video game, but too fiddly for the kind of quick fights I want to run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415945/#Comment_415945" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T22:13:33+00:00" title="June 10, 2013 10:13PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good idea, having some powers add options for stuff like SBF! I'm not sure that callin' some powers as weapons would really zone it in very much - it would if you counted cooldown stuff, but if you just treat it as "this is the thing he's mostly throwing around right now". <br/>I do agree with them that the nature of the power should be individual rather than categorical, with different powers showing up differently. Gives you more freedom, and I don't think trying to get all powers alike gains you much of anything.<br/><br/>I like the take on Shields/Armor. I don't usually like the additional Battle Moves from ApW (stay the fuck down, etc) but I guess it makes sense here.<br/>Right move on keeping Barriers and Shields alike. I brought it up because some powers are quite similar with the primary difference being which health part it targets, so there might be a bit of overlap in function then.

However, your moves and playbooks should be based on the central concept of *your* game. So ok, if you're making a game about a soldier squad in ME, fine, zoom in on the combat, have specific combat powers, combat roles and so on.<br/><br/>But personally, I'm bored with that - I want to play in ME world without necessarily replicating the ME shooter emphasis. (As a rule of thumb, I don't like games where combat mechanics are more complicated than diplomacy mechanics). Your description sounds like you want to allow such an experience as well. With that in mind, I'd be perfectly happy having a "soldier", a "biotic" and a "techie" playbook. Such a techie can be a combat squad member or they can be a junkyard techie. I'd also be quite happy with a generic "attack" move, a "when you use your biotics"/biotic move (usable for attack purposes AND stuff like lifting crates to open an entrance, or lifting and stealing a data pad out of someone's table), and "when you mess with someone else's equipment"/tech move.<br/><br/>What I would like to avoid with biotics is the effect you can see in fantasy systems, where most of the magic spells in spellbooks are only useful in combat. It makes sense if the system is focused on combat, but if you want to allow non-combat adventures, you need a wider choice of spells. Similarly, ME games described only those biotic power usages that would be useful in combat, but lift for example is begging for out-of-combat usages.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, barriers, fortification, lift, throw - these are all just colour, and they were quantified only for the shooter video game purposes. Just think of biotics as an equivalent of WoD Mage Forces.<br/><br/>Perhaps there's no need to add a new clock/countdown. Just have people take one segment of physical damage when they overextend themselves - since biotic skills rely on tiny bits of foreign substance embedded in flesh, so it makes sense you hurt after using them too much.<br/><br/>Also, I like Biotics being tied to Cool, although it may interfere with people's idea of a berserker-Vanguard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415968/#Comment_415968" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T05:33:52+00:00" title="June 11, 2013  5:33AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JasonT, the reason I did not like AE was that it made the classes race specific like your example.

(...)<br/><br/>What I would like to avoid with biotics is the effect you can see in fantasy systems, where most of the magic spells in spellbooks are only useful in combat. It makes sense if the system is focused on combat, but if you want to allow non-combat adventures, you need a wider choice of spells. Similarly, ME games described only those biotic power usages that would be useful in combat, but lift for example is begging for out-of-combat usages.</blockquote>\nThis is the thing I have struggled with the most, by far, and I've gone back and forth on it multiple times. In an earlier draft, I tried to come up with both combat applications and non-combat applications for most tech/biotic powers, but it ended up being a nightmare of complex and overlapping move mechanics. To look at one example (somewhat in contrast with my <i>pull</i> example above):<br/><br/><b><i>Pull:</i></b> When you use biotics to pull an object toward you, roll+cool. On a hit, small- to medium-sized objects can be lifted into the air toward you. On a 10+, you can name a specific trajectory for medium objects, or execute multidirectional control over small objects. If you use this power as a weapon against an unshielded, person-sized target (0-harm close seek lift recharge), they're momentarily disabled while lifted into the air and moving generally toward you.<br/><br/>\u2026 But then that raised questions of which move you're rolling if you use pull in a seize-by-force situation, whether you could pull instead of seizing to avoid actually suffering enemy fire, and so on. I came up with all kinds of special rules and exceptions before finally going to the other end of the spectrum. Now, in my most recent complete draft, all biotic power moves are explicitly combat focused, with only a single "biotic aptitude" move that serves both as a prereq for the rest and as a catch-all move for "move stuff with your mind in non-combat situations"; if you want to subtly lift a datapad off a table with biotics, you're acting under fire just as if you'd done it with your hand. You just have better range.<br/><br/>Looking at it now, though, I realize that while my most recent draft is totally "done" according to what I originally set out to do, it's so combat-focused that I'm not sure it's something I'd actually want to run. So I'm kind of stuck, trying to determine whether I should just run it with what I've got now, or whether I should go back to the drawing board. Maybe instead of using Mass Effect powers and classes as my starting points, I should start by thinking about the archetypes I want represented by playbooks, and moves for them that would make sense in a variety of scenarios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416005/#Comment_416005" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T13:30:01+00:00" title="June 11, 2013  1:30PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2013 1:47PM by 3Jane.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I was thinking of something like this:<br/><br/>When you <b>manipulate your surroundings with Biotics</b>, roll +cool. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 2.\n<ul>\n<li>You control your effect perfectly.</li>\n<li>You do not suffer flashbacks from your training.</li>\n<li>You are not exhausted.</li>\n<li>Your show of force does not increase the emotional distance/alienation between you and any non-biotics in attendance. (This requires serious rewording but you know what I mean).</li>\n</ul>\nand<br/><br/>When you <b>manipulate your surroundings with Biotics while exhausted</b>, mark the next segment of health countdown and roll as above.<br/><br/>I don't think it's worthwhile to determine how large objects, exactly, can be manipulated with Biotics. I want to be a fan of that character. That character is a bloody skilled Biotic, a Force God(dess). Her problem does not lie in the fact that she's too weak. The problems stem from what she had to get through to become a Biotic (Jack), from the fact that non-Biotics mistrust her (see how Turian Biotics are treated), from the fact that it's generally exhausting (Biotics school in ME3) and that it can have side effects when the forces slip out of control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Hacking Mass Effect/Apocalypse World - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18458/hacking-mass-effect-apocalypse-world/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Hacking Mass Effect/Apocalypse World - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18458/hacking-mass-effect-apocalypse-world/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Ohh, that is really clever.

The ApW system isn't a setting emulator, it's a genre emulator - it consistently allows for types of stories. ApW is about scarcity and communities surviving that scarcity. DW is about small fries facing great odds for glory and riches. MH is perhaps the most targeted of them all: it's a teen sex horror story. This is where stats, basic moves, and playbook selection become very obviously the key factors, as yo get to choose what's most important for the stories you're trying to tell. When you emulate setting, you want to encompass all sorts of stories, and thus you need all-around basic moves that cover most situations. When you emulate genre, you can choose to exclude certain things that don't help those stories (such as MH dropping the Sharp stat and Reading moves) and add those that would only make sense for those kinda of stories (Turn Someone On).<br/><br/>Here's a personal example with this hack: If I was the one in charge, I'd stop debating the nature of how being a paragon/renegade impacts the characters. For me, I don't want to hear about those morality stories, they're not the things I'm interested in in an ME game, and thus I'd leave them out. Comparatively, I'd focus on the exploration of an alien galaxy and give moves like "When you first step onto an untouched planet..."<br/>That's a different sort of story. Maybe not the one you want to tell, but it could be. What sort of game you want to run should be always in your mind, because it's locked tightly into the ApW system.<br/>Just remember: this system isn't meant to be a toolkit for every story in the Mass Effect universe, just like how ApW isn't a toolkit for every single post-apocalyptic story (hence why we have other games like The Quiet Year).<br/>With intention to use it for a small campaign, you can be even more focused. If you know you want the rachni in there, what role should they be? You could make it about reconciling with a misunderstood species, you could make it about destroying a dangerous threat, you could make it about conflict between the Krogan and the Rachni, or other things, and build from there.<br/>EDIT: Those things there are premises, seeds of where things are starting, not quite the same as specific stories as you'll still be playing to find out what happens. They're themes that can be expanded into the types of stories you intend to play, and then you can model the rules to play those sorts of stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416104/#Comment_416104" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T12:46:02+00:00" title="June 12, 2013 12:46PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2013 12:47PM by 3Jane.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What about something to do with alien-based misunderstanding?

I don't get the feeling that there's much ignorance there - the setting is pretty good with education and science.

I don't expect to use this hack to tell a specific story, but to tell certain kinds of stories, and I just want to make sure whatever playbooks and rules I end up with tell the kinds of stories my players will run with. Taking the rachni example, if my players are all jazzed to explore forgotten corners of space and learn the secrets of a lost species, they'll probably be bummed if the moves and playbooks I give them focus disproportionately on combat. If they just want to shoot a bunch of rachni in a scary cave, they'll probably be bummed if I hand them a bunch of playbooks labeled stuff like "the information broker," "the consort," and "the pilot." I just need to figure out what this hack will be able to support. <br/><br/>This does raise a question for me, though: Why <i>couldn't</i> you hack only part of Apocalypse World? Why is telling a specific story "utterly toxic" \u2013 and do you mean this about all RPGs, or just games with this system? What would break if you just took the basic structure for PCs \u2013\xa0wording and structure of moves, the basic dice mechanic, the idea of purposefully limited and niche-protected playbooks \u2013 and removed parts of the basic structure for MCs, like threats, fronts, or even "play to see what happens"? <br/><br/>I'm not planning on doing that myself here, but it's something I have thought about a lot, and Mass Effect seems like a potentially fine game to approach in that way, to my mind. In fact, I'd say the Mass Effect video games represent a sort of model of traditional tabletop gaming: The player customizes a character, controls fight scenes with a great deal of precision, and has a limited degree of input in deciding what to say in dialog and where to go in the world, but the options before the player are pretty clearly laid out. The player has some room to decide what happens in the end, but the basics of the story are already planned out before the player ever gets to the end. This is precisely how my friends run D&amp;D, and it works fine for us because we understand it's just that sort of game: There's a sort of social contract that they won't stray too far from what the GM planned. And besides, D&amp;D 4e rules don't strongly encourage deep thinking or tactics for anything BUT combat scenes anyway. Apocalypse World as written encourages more than that, but I can imagine a way of hacking it that refocuses attention into something narrower, something as limited as a video game. (Again, I'm not planning on doing this myself here \u2013 I feel like I'd be losing out on a lot of the options that pen-and-paper opens up in the first place \u2013\xa0but I figure if I understand this issue better, maybe I can hack this a little better.)<br/><br/>So in summary: Is there something built into Apocalypse World that suggests that going in without a specific story to tell is the "right" way, or is that just one among multiple viable approaches with hacking this system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416665/#Comment_416665" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T12:39:23+00:00" title="June 19, 2013 12:39PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This does raise a question for me, though: Why <i>couldn't</i> you hack only part of Apocalypse World?

Stories are almost all about people and their choices and actions.  And the protagonists of an RPG should always be under the control of the PCs, not the GM.<br/><br/>The closest you can get (in my experience anyway) to a predetermined story that is also a satisfying RPG is probably <a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/" rel="nofollow">Montsegur 1244</a> and I suspect that two of the reasons that game works as well as it does are that it's GMless (meaning there's no person to blame when things go half-arbitrarily against you) and the whole thing leads up to a truly impressive final decision for the PCs (at least one must burn, at most one may escape).<br/><br/>Like any rule of ... just about anything, an expert knows when to break it.  But it's one rule that unless you're up to something really clever shouldn't be broken.\n<blockquote>What would break if you just took the basic structure for PCs \u2013\xa0wording and structure of moves, the basic dice mechanic, the idea of purposefully limited and niche-protected playbooks \u2013 and removed parts of the basic structure for MCs, like threats, fronts, or even "play to see what happens"? </blockquote>\nMonsterhearts doesn't really have threats or fronts, and it has different moves.<br/><br/>The basic dice mechanic can be changed - I'm not sure why anyone would.  It's simple, fast, and light.  And everyone has d6s.  But I'm now thinking of rolling a handful of dF with -1 as a hard fail and +2 as 10+.  <br/><br/>Without the playbooks character generation would take much longer and there'd be more joseling for position as people overlapped more.  Class based leads to fast generation and distinctive characters.\n<blockquote>This is precisely how my friends run D&amp;D, and it works fine for us because we understand it's just that sort of game: There's a sort of social contract that they won't stray too far from what the GM planned. </blockquote>\nI've seen that one - on the other hand in my last two D&amp;D sessions I prepared one lead for the PCs.  The first session they got natural 20s on perception checks I wasn't even expecting them to roll.  Three times in the session, meaning they started digging on the story arc rather than the local threats.  Last session I pointed out one set of leads - they went after another that were logically there and I hadn't prepared at all.  So rather than my planed epic fight on top of the lightning rail they ended up in the smoking ruins of what had been a match factory deep in the bowels of Sharn.  Sometimes I wonder why I bother preparing, and I wouldn't have things any other way.\n<blockquote>And besides, D&amp;D 4e rules don't strongly encourage deep thinking or tactics for anything BUT combat scenes anyway.</blockquote>\nOn the other hand they are surprisingly powerful and flexible when put through their paces.  It doesn't encourage the PCs to break away - but gives the DM a lot of good tools when they do.  (And for a new DM the long combats are a positive boon - they mean you can take a break from keeping one step ahead of your maniacs).\n<blockquote>So in summary: Is there something built into Apocalypse World that suggests that going in without a specific story to tell is the "right" way, or is that just one among multiple viable approaches with hacking this system?</blockquote>\nIt's more that you can get away with a whole lot more that way in D&amp;D because if you cut every last scrap of roleplaying out of D&amp;D 4e it would make a pretty good boardgame.

I'll re-hit some specific points with my interpretations.\n<blockquote>Taking the rachni example, if my players are all jazzed to explore forgotten corners of space and learn the secrets of a lost species, they'll probably be bummed if the moves and playbooks I give them focus disproportionately on combat. If they just want to shoot a bunch of rachni in a scary cave, they'll probably be bummed if I hand them a bunch of playbooks labeled stuff like "the information broker," "the consort," and "the pilot." I just need to figure out what this hack will be able to support. </blockquote>\nThis is a good thing to talk about. One thing that's pretty different about ApW is that every playbook has at least a baseline effectiveness in combat, even if that's not their specialty. It's a tough world, everyone in the post-apocalyspe (everyone we care about at least) knows how to handle themselves pretty well. Comparatively, Mass Effect's universe gets pretty cushy sometimes - pilots and politicians and consorts might not know their way around a weapon, so suddenly NOT everyone has some combat effectiveness. This might mean you need a wider number of playbooks to be able to accommodate combat and non-combat players.<br/>If that sounds like a lot of work, it is. For your case specifically, ask your players what kind of thing they want to do. Just a general feeling of the direction they want to play. Since you know who's gonna be playing you have the ability to do that, and it's not cheating in any way. Just remember that if they give you a direction, only use that to design the game's selection and the premise, not the plot of what will happen.<br/><br/>There's another path as well, and that's to re-examine the very idea of "Soldier" and "Sentinel" and "Engineer" and "Consort" and "Pilot" and see if the archetypes of the series aren't related to profession necessarily at all. The Leader (Shepard, Miranda, Wrex, Zaeed). The Technical Prodigy (Liara, Mordin, Tali, EDI). The Career Soldier (Jacob, Kaidan, Ashley, James, Garrus, Grunt). The Merciless (Jack, Thane, Samara, Javik, Kasumi). I'm just spitballing with these specific ideas, but my point is that what the archetypes are might be a bit more abstract than something spelled out so explicitly in the games than just the classes or literal professions. If each of those archetypes isn't so explicitly combat or non-, you have more flexibility with what you can put on the table. You could even have one or two playbooks that are significantly non-combat as long as they still would have things to do in a combat mission.<br/>(did I actually just shove every single crew member into 4 playbooks? You probably don't want <i>that</i> few, just for the record)\n<blockquote>Why couldn't you hack only part of Apocalypse World?</blockquote>\nNeonchameleon has covered this basically, so I'll just augment. Yes, dice mechanics can be changed too, as can move structure. An occasional shift that I witness (currently with a thing in the Neon Genesis Evangelion hack I'm also discussing here, but also with ApW's Harm mvoe) is to flip the expectations so that you want to roll LOW. I don't like that structure, but it's obvious that you CAN slide things around still. Another game, Undying (for playing Vampire the Masquerade ApW-style), doesn't use dice at all, instead relying on a Blood Token economy as the mechanism of the moves. It's pretty fun actually. Everything you mentioned can be messed with, with one exception: "play to find out what happens." I don't want that messed with in <i>any</i> game I play, not just ApW, with the rare exception of games like Montsegur 1244, in which it changes to "play to find out how this happens."\n<blockquote>the Mass Effect video games represent a sort of model of traditional tabletop gaming</blockquote>\nYEAH they do! Turns out it's not exactly ME-specific - Bioware almost as a category makes their games this way. KotOR, Dragon Age - it's their legacy as the designers of the Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights games. This is the big reason I think looking at the universe itself and modeling the interactions we see or could imagine, not just the way the game lets us interact (looking right at Interrupts right now), is the thing to model in the hack, because otherwise, yeah, that's taking in a bunch of Trad concepts that we don't really need to get the Mass Effect essence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416700/#Comment_416700" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T07:14:35+00:00" title="June 20, 2013  7:14AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2013 7:16AM by JasonT.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the feedback. I was a little unclear \u2013\xa0I am familiar with Undying and Monsterhearts, and love their Apocalypse-Worldliness but also how cleanly they do their own thing. Really, what I was mostly trying to get at was whether the style of GMing Apocalypse World encourages is demanded by its mechanics in a way I can't see, or whether it's just a style of GMing and play preferred (in ANY game) by the kinds of players who like Apocalypse World. Your examples and explanations imply the latter to me. And that's cool, of course \u2013\xa0I love it myself \u2013\xa0but as I talk to my players, I'm finding that they want something a little more guided for Mass Effect. <br/><br/>As I see it, different kinds of GMing exist on a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum is complete free-form let's-play-pretend. On the other end is a single person narrating a story to other people who have limited if any input. Somewhere near(er) the free-form end of that spectrum is Apocalypse World as written. Somewhere near(er) the narrating end of the spectrum is every awful DM you ever had who insists upon railroading you through THEIR story in THEIR world and gives you no real agency. Apparently my players want something in between those, at least for Mass Effect \u2013\xa0a story planned out before they even show up to make their characters, a plot twist in there for them to discover, a puzzle pre-planned for them to solve, a few spectacular scenes that will almost certainly happen (even if they must be transposed from one set piece to another depending on where the players decide to go), and multiple possible endings (but with a few likely ones jotted down in advance). The players still have the power to redirect the course of the story, but they'll actively rein in the urge to go too "off course" because they enjoy the stuff that's more prepared more than stuff that's clearly improvised.<br/><br/>I'd never try to prep Apocalypse World that way just because I've already come to think of the game in a different way, with all these great tools to communally tell stories about the most interesting people in a weird, harsh locale. But I don't see anything in the basic resolution mechanic and playbook structure to imply to me that I couldn't take those concepts and move them over to a different setting where my players get a more guided experience, at their request.<br/><br/>(Mind you, as I've said, I have limited time for this project now, so my players are going to get something less prepared either way. Now that I have a better sense of what they actually want, though, I'm just trying to gauge how much/how little prep I can really get away with...)<br/><br/>Changing gears, in case folks were wondering about the direction I'm headed with playbooks: My players are excited about a "black ops missions" style of Mass Effect game much more so than an "interesting people living their lives" style of game, which obviously implies different sorts of characters. I think I'm going to focus right now on something that would support what they want (though I'm still not sure whether that means focusing on the original Mass Effect classes, or simply reskinning The Regiment). I've got a ton of notes for other, less military playbooks, though, so hopefully I'll be able put those up after I've got the stuff in place my own players will want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416706/#Comment_416706" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T09:35:30+00:00" title="June 20, 2013  9:35AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, that would work.

What do you mean when you say "an entirely different mechanical structure"? <br/><br/>Let me put it this way, to make it a little more concrete: You might know that the makers of Mass Effect already licensed one of their games, Dragon Age, to be made into a tabletop RPG with pre-planned adventure modules. If you wanted to run one such adventure but stripped out their dice system and character classes to replace with your own favorite system from some other game, would replacing it with Apocalypse-World-style rules be somehow more problematic than replacing it with FATE, GURPS, Castle Falkenstein-style card mechanics, or any other game that DOESN'T specifically encourage you not to plan? (Again, I love not-planning! I'm just unclear on how that is so integral to these mechanics that <i>not</i> doing that somehow requires extra playtesting.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416710/#Comment_416710" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T10:34:59+00:00" title="June 20, 2013 10:34AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's simple but not easy.<br/><br/>You need to figure out what it is that the players actually ARE making meaningful decisions about, and then make the rules about those things.<br/><br/>For instance, if the pre-plotted storyline requires NPCs to make certain types of decisions, then the "seduce/manipulate" move will probably not work very well for your game. If the game requires certain enemies to be unkillable or very threatening, then the way AW harm works and the way moves like "go aggro" work, as well as principles like "look through crosshairs", need to be changed. And so on. If the MC in this game needs control over all elements of backstory, then "ask provocative questions" and "don't prep" might need to be cut out and replaced.

These MC moves, the flow, the guided conversation, are an integral part of the AW mechanics.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think you're asking if there is anything in the player moves that doesn't support preplanned play.  Which is only looking at one side of the mechanics.  I don't have an answer, but you'd have to look carefully at how the player moves would interact and snowball with the new more 'trad' MC moves.

This has become not just an academic question to me since I first asked it, as my wife tells me she wants to run this game sometime with more of a planned adventure. (She's never run a game before, so I'm inclined to encourage her to do whatever will make her most comfortable ... but yeah, that's a conversation for another thread.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: Good point on unkillable NPCs, harm mechanics, and crosshairs principle. That is the kind of thing that I might have assumed was totally obvious in a game where certain things HAVE to happen, but now that you mention it, I wouldn't have thought to advise another GM of this (especially on her first time GMing.) <br/><br/>And yeah, there are a couple moves that I've realized (from fiddling with this and other hacks) really need to be rephrased for other sorts of settings, especially if you want the story to be a bit more directed. Seduce &amp; Manipulate works fine in a lawless apocalypse land, but it strains credulity to try to use it as-written to talk your way past armed guards in the White House (for instance). The Maestro D's move that basically allows you to have any object brought to you for free would (if directly as written) wreak havoc on any game where "find this MacGuffin" is supposed to be a major part of the action. I will think on that as I put in moves ... and probably I will end up putting in some moves that break stuff, but hey, what's a playtest without some broken stuff?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Cneph">@Cneph</a>: Yeah, what I want to know is WHAT makes the not-planning "integral." If you have any other examples, that would be useful. That said, I don't think you need to ditch the entire MC side of the rules in order to try running something a bit more directed. Like I said, I suspect there's a spectrum you could operate on here: You can not-plan what will happen moment-to-moment, how the PCs will get from point A to point B, could you still plan on what point B is and tell them "that's where you're headed"? Like, you're still looking at NPCs in the crosshairs, still a fan of the characters, still responding to misses with hard moves, still improvising with unexpected turns in the story, etc., but before the players ever show up for the first session, you know that they're going to be carrying out a particular mission with some specific objectives, even if you don't know HOW they're going to do it, and....<br/><br/>Wait, wait, the word "objectives" just reminded me \u2013 that's precisely how The Regiment works. Which I have been rereading a ton as I work on this hack. Huh. Why the hell did that not occur to me before?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/3Jane">@3Jane</a>: Thanks for mentioning Tremulus. Yeah, I'm now inclined to agree that AW-based games do in fact already support a variety of GMing styles. And countdown clocks are indeed a great way of keeping things open-ended while still making sure you've alerted players to the fact that there is a "point B" for them to get to ASAP.<br/><br/>Apologies if I was unclear in what I was asking about, but you've all given some great food for thought as I think about moves, and especially as I think about helping my wife figure out how to GM a game.

How does AW handle such cases? If I don't think player X's character should realistically be able to straight up seduce a guard, what do I tell them?</blockquote>\nI think there are a couple different ways to answer this question.<br/><br/>First, it's a question about how the move should work <i>in Apocalypse World.</i> In a post-apocalyptic setting where everybody's just trying to get by and find a little bit of pleasure where they can, I think the move is just fine as it is. Sure, the Battlebabe can totally seduce Dremmer while he's on guard duty. Why not? Who'd rob this old junk heap anyway? He hates this fuckin job anyway. A secret service agent working the presidential detail at the White House, though? (Or hell, a C-Sec guard on Council detail, just to bring this back to the thread...) Not without some mind-control stuff, no. Not that even these guards aren't human (or salarian, or whatever), but the stakes are bigger, and there's a sort of sociological pressure at work here. The more structured the society, I think, the more those sociological pressures should be apparent in the average NPC's actions. You get a lot more guards blowing off duty for a roll in the hay after the entire world has already gone to shit than in a world with an organized legal system and personnel records that will follow you to your next job. <br/><br/>Second, I'd say it's a question of fictional positioning. Like, in Dungeon World, you don't use Hack &amp; Slash if you don't already have your sword drawn, right? And clearly, you don't use Seduce or Manipulate on someone who's in a coma. The question becomes, then, at what point you CAN use Seduce or Manipulate on someone, and if there's going to be some question about this, I think it's wise to write guidelines for fictional positioning directly into the move. Dungeon World accounts for this to some extent by specifying that you need to have some kind of leverage, so my working plan is to borrow that idea, but still give you the option to just persuade through words like you can in Mass Effect. (Working text of the Charm move currently includes: <i>On a hit, NPCs will do what you want as long as they get something they want (e.g., "an even trade," "to do the right thing").</i>) This takes into consideration that they must reasonably be expected to actually want whatever you offer them; some people can't be bribed, seduced, etc., and it's up to you to figure out what they want.\n<blockquote><blockquote>The Maestro D's move that basically allows you to have any object brought to you for free would (if directly as written) wreak havoc on any game where "find this MacGuffin" is supposed to be a major part of the action.</blockquote>\nNot necessarily.

Think how these obstacles react to the fact that MacGuffin is in Maestro D's hands. Action doesn't end with possessing the thing, there are always consequences.</blockquote>\nOh, for sure,\xa0but this gets back to the issue of going in with a pre-planned story vs. letting players direct the story more. If "action doesn't end with possessing the thing," we're really talking about skipping ahead to a new "chapter." It's a terrific move for a "don't prep" game in that storytelling potential is built right into it; when the player makes this move, they know they're potentially redirecting the course of things to come. For a more prepared story, I just worry that using it directly as written would defuse some planning by a GM who doesn't take it into account. (I can very easily picture some of my friends laying out a heist story \u2013\xa0"You're going to break into the Citadel Archives to steal a Prothean artifact!" \u2013\xa0and then looking either deflated or panicked when somebody goes, "Oh, I'll just roll to see if I can get the artifact delivered to us.

Works for the Regiment.<br/><br/>If you go into sessions wedded to the idea that the mission objectives must happen, especially if you have a preconceived order in mind, you will need to identify the shortcut moves, like Seduce/Manipulate or the Maestro'D move in question.<br/><br/>As you've already figured out, the answer is probably in fictional positioning.  In AW, it's established that these PCs are the sexiest, baddest, coolest fuckers around- that's part of their default fictional positioning, in that it makes the damaged, selfish, desperate schmucks who make up the rest of the world want to be with them, please them, or at least not piss them off.  Some of the time anyway, dice dependent.<br/><br/>So, when you're looking at moves, I reckon it would be productive to figure out what the default fictional positioning of your crew being a disparate multi-species crew of black ops special forces badasses operating in a sophisticated pangalactic culture permits, and shape the structure accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416838/#Comment_416838" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-22T14:43:04+00:00" title="June 22, 2013  2:43PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For a more prepared story, I just worry that using it directly as written would defuse some planning by a GM who doesn't take it into account.</blockquote>\nI suppose this difference in what prep is to different people: I tend to prep people and their motivations more than locations/events, so in the above, I'm still using my prep (how would person X react to this change of events?).

Long story short: It's on hold, and now I'm kicking around ideas for a shorter, "World of Dungeons"-style approach. ("<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Game_Shop" rel="nofollow">Galaxy of Fantasy</a>," anyone?)<br/><br/>Long story a bit longer: I wrote up a few drafts until getting to something pretty much complete (which you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vP-6MCUyTPxspHbN7jcm9O0czq9OIotcbHAVVsOSOVU/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">read here if you're interested</a>), but then decided it was <i>way</i> more complex and combat-focused than I wanted, with a lot of redundant powers and multi-stat basic moves. Then, partway through revising it (edit to add: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/187dW0IVW3N4fbBLZAqvRPstCZ-_T0MbWU_OW20UURwU/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">the notes for which you can see here</a>, if interested), I realized that my players actually kind of <i>want</i> something combat-focused, but not necessarily something complex, <i>unless</i> it's based on D&amp;D 4e, which they absolutely love. So \u2026\xa0yeah, not sure how to deal with that yet, as hacking Mass Effect to run in D&amp;D 4e sounds like kind of a lot of work (and tough to run given the lack of official miniatures). Also, you know, busy life, personal stuff, blah blah blah, and I've also been a bit distracted by my players suddenly deciding that <i>they</i> want to GM a bunch of stuff all at once, which is a nice change.<br/><br/>So, yeah, the longer version of this hack is on hold until I have some more time and figure out exactly what I want to do with it. If you feel like offering any input for a shorter take, though, please do. I could just do a straight-up reskinning of World of Dungeons, but I'd kind of like to make those things sound more Mass Effect-y, and I'm open to ideas. (Like, what would the attributes be if not the standard Str/Dex/Wis/etc. set?

The Leader (Shepard, Miranda, Wrex, Zaeed). The Technical Prodigy (Liara, Mordin, Tali, EDI). The Career Soldier (Jacob, Kaidan, Ashley, James, Garrus, Grunt). The Merciless (Jack, Thane, Samara, Javik, Kasumi). I'm just spitballing with these specific ideas, but my point is that what the archetypes are might be a bit more abstract than something spelled out so explicitly in the games than just the classes or literal professions. If each of those archetypes isn't so explicitly combat or non-, you have more flexibility with what you can put on the table. You could even have one or two playbooks that are significantly non-combat as long as they still would have things to do in a combat mission.<br/>(did I actually just shove every single crew member into 4 playbooks? You probably don't want that few, just for the record)<br/></blockquote>\nI've been designing a small, light Ghost Lines-style mini-hack to emulate the "feel" I personally get from Mass Effect without being tied down too much with setting details. I just want it to knock around with some friends of mine who really like what I've shared with them about Mass Effect but aren't into video games, so it doesn't need to be pretty and I'm not really looking for feedback, but this discussion is certainly of interest and I'm enjoying a lot of the moves and such bouncing around here. <br/><br/>I wanted to add an addendum to the above comment, though. One thing about the "classes" that's somewhat evocative is that they have a lot of personality built into them and they mirror some of the broader story archetypes. For example, while it would be unfortunate to limit cool biotic powers to the Kaidan-esque, cool-as-ice Career Soldier by modeling an Adept playbook on Kaidan ... there's a lot to work with in the Sentinel, Soldier and Vanguard. The Vanguard doesn't have to just be a combat descriptor--Vanguards push the envelope. They head out in front, put themselves in harm's way, draw attention be it gunfire or political machinations; the Vanguard taken liberally like this is a blunt force that leads by doing, clearing the path ahead and gleaming brightly rather than but subtler encouragements and planning. It's the Shepard/Wrex playbook, for characters who throw themselves into the fire and dare anyone to get in their way (even Paragon Shepard is pretty bull-headed though there's wiggle room with Shepard for obvious reasons). I don't feel like I can do this as well for the Infiltrator (a little too combat-y), Adept (likewise) and the Engineer is sort of on the edge. But while I don't want to take too much page space with this I think the Soldier and Sentinel are just as rich IF you take the effort to unpackage where the combination of the name and the combat abilities and the description and so forth leads to by stripping Shepard out of the class and seeing if there's anything left.<br/><br/>The nice thing about using these terms once you've deconstructed them is that they're familiar to Mass Effect fans and they add that nice little spice of meta-level authenticity.<br/><br/>Also, I would recommend taking a look at how Star Wars World handles the Force. It's worth considering that Biotic Powers were as clear-cut and discrete as they were in the game for very video-gamey reasons. Unless you're trying to emulate the feel of Mass Effect combat, don't feel tied down to Shockwave and Singularity; even if you accept those moves as canon rather than mechanical conveniences, I'd lean toward thinking of these moves like a formalized martial art. They're patterns that can help people learn biotic control and can have assistance hard-coded into amps but that become meaningless in a lot of contexts and/or once you are facing a highly trained opponent whether or not that opponent <i>has</i> biotics. Consider the value of making looser Biotic moves that allow you to play around with Biotic Amps as gear in a less fiddly context and allow you to really explore what warping mass effect fields can do. Consider that, outside of the limited view we get in combat sequences, Biotics represent the ability to bend mass and thus gravity to your will. Blunt, simple effects are the easiest (singularity, throw, pull, barriers) and precision is consistently thought of as more difficult than sheer bursts of power. That said, individuals (and their respective amps) have upper limits to how much power they can unleash. Consider all of the biotic powers; what's really distinct about them? Biotic abilities seen in the game fall into relatively few categories--unleashing force, holding/pinning, directly harming, ripping through scenery/armor, putting up barriers.<br/><br/>So there you've got anywhere from 1 to ... call it 6 moves sprinkled throughout various playbooks or anyone's-game move lists, all of which are more flexible than Pull, Throw, Reave, etc. For reference:\n<blockquote>Force Ritual: you get two force powers, choose them when you take<br/>this move. When you call on the force, take 1-harm ap and roll+attuned.<br/>On a 10+, hold force-3. On a 7-9, hold force-1. On a miss, you may<br/>hold force-2 by giving into your fear, anger or hatred, along with the<br/>usual consequences of a missed roll. While you have hold, you cannot<br/>recover from the harm you took using this move.</blockquote>\nOnce you have hold ...\n<blockquote>\u2022 Telekinesis: while you have force-hold, you can use the force to move<br/>and manipulate simple unattended objects (it may still be doing something<br/>dangerous, though). You may spend Hold to move something massive,<br/>move people harmlessly, propel yourself up to a great height or forward at<br/>great speed, or use telekinesis as a weapon (1-harm ap close area)</blockquote>\nSo in Star Wars World, you channel the force (obviously the Dark Side bit isn't relevant here) and then you have Hold. As long as you're focusing (holding) you can do small things (though as stated, in ME precision and small manipulations would be as big a deal as something major like Shockwave) and then you can spend to really shake things up. All of the force moves are like this--minor effect while you have hold, major effect when you spend hold. It's a kinda FATE-system-y thing fit neatly into the Apocalypse system now that I think about it. Some of the force powers augment moves (Force Empathy gives you bonus questions on Read Person), others like Telekinesis just give you fictional positioning (the ability to spin a deadly lightsaber through the air as long as it's small and unattended). This doesn't model Biotics perfectly, but it's a neat way of handling The Force and the way Star Wars World breaks the Force down into 4 main force powers, with a couple playbook specific powers/power-enhancers, and a single Channel the Force move is <i>really cool</i> and a nice model for how to do generic powers like bending the Force (or Mass Effect fields) without making generic, flavorless moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422113/#Comment_422113" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T13:32:57+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  1:32PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't read Star Wars World yet, so I'll probably check that out. My instinctive personal take would be to be fast and loose with biotics - the moves regarding them wouldn't be like "singularity" or "pull" and more like "When you [do biotics]..." and exactly what you're doing is just a broad category. I like the idea of using Hold though, that could be interesting.<br/><br/>I like the deconstruction you did for the classes! It's definitely well thought out, and is a completely viable path to writing the playbooks. My main point before was that you shouldn't feel <i>obligated</i> to use the game terms, and that there are other lines that could be divided along.<br/>I'll toss out that it's not the part I'm really interested personally though. I'm big on playbooks being about your mindset, rather than what you literally do, and I think that while Vanguard &amp; Solider &amp; Adept include elements of your mindset, I just feel weird using it. Not sure why really. Taste, I guess.<br/><br/>So Jason, I skimmed through your draft a week or so ago, and while I liked some of the mechanics, I came to the same conclusion re: combat and complexity. In a fit of inspiration, I wrote up my own framework for a hack. It uses the stats Heroic, Paragon, Renegade, Experienced, Alien, has the basic moves Bold Aggression (+REN) (just shooting is not bold aggression), Dig In (+EXP) (aka Stay Down, depending on which page of my notes you're looking at), Give Orders (+HER), Support Your Team (+PAR), Enact a Crazy Idea (+ALN). The playbooks are Leader (HER/ALN), Agent (PAR/HER), Rebel (REN/EXP), Veteran (EXP/PAR), Loner (ALN/REN), Academic (ALN/EXP). Species are a bunch of little playbooks with ~3 moves each about the defining traits of their race. Biotics is mostly just a thing you do as a narrative thing (ie it's how you might do bold aggression or dig in or whatever) but I'm also thinking of making a species playbook for Biotic, as for those who focus very heavily on being biotic it becomes more defining than what species they are. I dunno about that though.<br/>In that, the playbooks have a decent split of established characters among them, the stats are all about personality, and the moves all can be used in-combat and out-of-combat. The back-and-forth of combat is assumed, and what actually matters is the actions you take <i>during</i> the firefight. <br/>I wrote the entire brainstorm on Twitter, and later Storified it here: <a href="http://storify.com/Logbook_Project/mass-effect-apw-hack-twitter-brainstorm" rel="nofollow">HERE IS THAT BRAINSTORM.</a><br/><br/>Don't mean to hijack your thread Jason, just wanted to put it here since you guys inspired it and also in case it inspires other hackers. I dunno if I'll keep going with this at all, Avatar World and The Old World get my priority, but I'm interested in continuing to talk about this sort of hack. Also Gwathdring, when it's at a presentable state I'm totally interested in seeing that Ghost Lines hack. <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422137/#Comment_422137" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-28T02:35:21+00:00" title="September 28, 2013  2:35AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2013 2:54AM by Gwathdring.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just used Ghost Lines as a reference point because it doesn't feel like a straight-up AW hack, but it's living in that space because I really enjoy GMing AW and the next most natural system for what I'm trying to do would be FATE which would end up with slightly the wrong flavor and/or a lot more work. Apocalypse World is light, but Ghost Lines is lighter and more pre-packaged ... I also agree with what folks have said about Apocalypse World being better at creating a kind of story than a generic story in a specific setting, but I think Ghost Lines plays with that and shifts away from Genre and toward Setting which makes it an excellent reference for what I want to run for my friends. That said I wouldn't exactly call it a Ghost Lines hack, if that makes sense? Rest assured, now I've been browsing this discussion it's going to look at least familiar. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I really like your brainstorm's results. I'm not entirely sold on your playbooks and stats, but I LOVE the moves. Enact a Crazy Idea and Bold Aggression are particularly lovely--makes me all nostalgic for my Spawl campaign. The Sprawl has a "hurt things" move called Mix it Up that only comes into play when you put yourself in harm's way in order to inflict harm. On a hit, you do it and on a 7-9 you take fire while you do it. I imagine you could spice that up to make it less ... understated so as to fit the higher-octane setting of Mass Effect. Enact a Crazy Idea I don't quite have my head around yet, but it's a lovely premise.<br/><br/>The Mix it Up reference reminds me of something. When designing aggression moves, thing about what <i>not</i> having a basic AW move says. The Sprawl doesn't have Seize By Force. You want to take something you need to Play Hardball/Manipulate so they give it to you or Play Hardball/Mix it Up so they're dead and it's yours. This means that when you want something that's protected there's always a middle step--you're never charging straight at what you want, but zig-zagging towards it. This also leaves the MC weasel room--you can't always get what you want. In Apocalypse world, if you want something that's protected you can just bull-rush it if you don't want to put up with the middle steps and more importantly, the MC can't ever take that away from you; the world is your oyster if you're bad enough to beat it into submission.  Lovely.<br/><br/>Similarly, I don't think Mass Effect needs a Play Hardball, Seduce/Manipulate, or a Seize By Force. When you want something, you pull rank, or inspire with authority/reputation. Sure, you can threaten ... but I don't think that needs to be mechanical. I think every threat should have a middle step; Go Aggro implies that fundamentally, across the gameworld, there is no hesitation between "I'll shoot if you don't drop the detonator" and <i>bam</i> ... and that doesn't feel Mass Effect-y even if it's certainly how some characters would behave in-fiction. Mass Effect is the kind of story where there's a hesitation. Even if it's only a milisecond in-world, Shepard has a chance to decide that it's not worth the cost. In Mass Effect, it's not over until the body hits the ground (and even then Thorian's, Rachni and Reaper Tech are still  on the table :P). Going back to the other two moves I vetoed, I don't think you can always get what you want in Mass Effect and I don't think you can always get people to go along. Seduce/Manipulate I'm a little less sure about but I think you could get away without it.<br/><br/>The catch is that we need two things out of the basic moves that I'm not seeing in your list--a way to assess the environment for information and a way to manipulate authority. Give Orders executes authority, so how do you build it? How does your reputation play into your ability to Give Orders? There's a move and/or sub-system missing here and it's centered on authority--and if it's written right it can do away with Seduce/Manipulate, too. Something like "Take Command" or "Recruit" or ...

Glad you like the batch of stuff I drew up. Before going into the specifics of what I wrote, I wanted to respond to a couple things you brought up. I meant to do this a week ago and I guess I forgot to actually hit Post Comment.<br/><br/>I absolutely agree that not having a particular move is a strong statement. That's the motivation I had in not including a particular Just Shooting move, because I think that's not what the series is about. I will bring up that Seduce/Manipulate isn't really getting exactly what you want - you always have to give something up or convince them. In ApW, it's a promise, even if you succeed, and while you aren't bound to it immediately, it still has consequences if you break it. I get what you mean though, and, well, that's why it's not there <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/><br/>That said, similarly, I think that millisecond of hesitation <i>IS</i> in Go Aggro. When they have the choice to cave or suck it up, if they choose to push you and take it, what that really is is calling your bluff. Now, given the personality of 90% of ApW characters, they're going to pull the trigger immediately - that's the genre. But mechanically, there's still a chance to back down, which is a lot more Mass Effect-y. If I were rewriting GA for this though, I would definitely term it "they have to choose whether to give into your demands or call your bluff" to make the chance to back down more apparent.<br/><br/>It wasn't there at the time, but I think the version of Enact A Crazy Plan I came up with is pretty good as an Assess The Environment in advance. Once you're there, well, I don't think directly observing stuff is really what the game is about so much, and I think it might be best handled by just having the MC answer questions, or not, based on what's apparent, no roll necessary. As for manipulating authority, I don't think that brainstorm before mentioned Loyalty, which is my as-yet-unfinished Hx replacement which has the authority bits already built-in to a degree. Also, keep in mind that "position of authority" does not mean "higher on the chain of command." If you are higher on the chain of command, yes, you have a definite group you can Give Orders to. However, you can have other types of authority. If you're the expert hacker and needing others to do what you want, you've got the authority there. If you're a badass soldier (even a low-ranking one) tell your group that they need to get out of here now, you'll cover their escape, and they don't want to, you're the authority there. And if you've gone AWOL and you're fighting back at Udina, it doesn't matter if he gives you orders - he's no authority to you right now. There can absolutely be people who both have different types of authority over each other at the same time. As for Taking Command, well, when you Take Charge you can Give Orders. Not really a move, just a thing.<br/><br/>So, uh, yeah. There's a page with all of the basic concepts I threw together. It is all completely open content to this thread - if you have a thing you think would be more in-line with the series than what I'm going with, I don't mind at all if you just take, word-for-word, stuff I've got so far and want to run in a different direction with it. I'm guessing from here I'm starting to take a more personal take on what parts of the setting I want to focus on, so adapt at your own leisure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422856/#Comment_422856" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T20:44:48+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  8:44PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick clarification: I meant <i>Shepard</i> gets a millisecond of hesitation, not the target.

Read it backwards. Even then, as far as character moves go, I wouldn't really provide grace - maybe that's a thing for MC principles, that there's always another moment for action or something. Basically it would only need to be in the rules if the targets need the moment of hesitation, which I don't think they do (what with principles like Look Through Crosshairs). It's a little harsh if the players are essentially going aggro on each other, but I don't think this is the right genre for the characters to actually do that to each other anyway.<br/>Of course, it's kinda a null point since Go Aggro itself isn't in the game and there isn't a real direct analog to it.<br/><br/>Looking forward to hearing what you think!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422957/#Comment_422957" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-16T01:32:06+00:00" title="October 16, 2013  1:32AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2013 1:45AM by Cneph.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting ideas.

The thing I'm stumbling a bit more over is how the value is raised during play - the usual "at end of session" rate is very slow for me. On the other hand, "when you act loyally toward them, raise your Loyalty with them by 1" is very, uh, blunt. And not all that interesting of a mechanic.<br/>Also, and this is a much sillier reason, I'm not going straight to the establishing questions because I did that with Avatar World and want to see if I can come up with something different, just for variety in my projects.<br/><br/>If you have any more ideas for establishing questions that'd be pretty awesome.

In general, I don't think there's anything significant for me personally - I feel mostly comfortable with the list. If there was one I would think about, it would be the reverse side of The Veteran: The Rookie. No one in the games is new to this stuff really except maybe Tali (and she's plenty experienced, just not in adventure or combat). Even then, The Rookie may actually be better handled as another playbook (Rebel / Loner / etc) or characters with a low Experienced stat, rather than its own playbook.<br/>That's pretty much it for me that I can think of. A bit ago I was thinking about a Support-esque character (eg Chakwas, Joker) but felt that was better left to NPCs - the support crew is the backup, not the main cast. They could have an interesting game, but I think it'd be a different game.<br/><br/>However, personal opinion aside, I'm totally interested in hearing if you or others had any such archetypes that would have been welcome in ME but didn't quite appear.

It's use on PCs doesn't feel like a Basic Move. On NPCs? Sure. On PCs? If feels like a playbook move. Why should every player as one of their most basic ways of interacting with the game systems be able to assert authority over other players by giving them orders? That's ... odd. Really odd. I don't grok that at all, especially not as a Mass Effect thing.<br/><br/>I feel like there are some gaps in the Basic Moves. It's possible some of these things aren't needed, but to be convinced of that I'd want more depth (through more moves or tighter synthesis or through interlocking playbook moves) to the ways of doing already on display. Here's what I'm not finding:<br/><br/>There's no established way to build non-hierarchical but nonetheless mechanically relevant relationships with NPCs--of particular relevance is that there's no way to build authority and rapport separately from using it to give orders. There's no established way to assess the environment, NPCs or "clues" or what-have-you. There's no established way to get stuff (doesn't have to be a barter move). There's no established way to interact with missions, jobs, or chain-of-command--your authority plays into a key basic move; surely someone's authority is key to why you're here and what you're doing whether it's authority you're following or authority you're running from (this sounds like exactly the sort of thing the playbooks can clear up). Lastly, there's nothing that really evokes an exploration of alien thought--Enact a Crazy Plan says it does this, but while I wouldn't argue with the stat choice, I don't think it creates a sense of delving into thought, orthodoxy, alien-ness or similar which you say you're interested in doing.<br/><br/>Zooming in on one of those that seems most "basic move-y" for a moment, I'm coming around to being ok with there being no way to assess the environment, but again I'm missing some establishment, maneuvering, and similar moves to buy that completely--or some principles that make it clear the MC's side of the field is a mostly-open book such that knowing isn't anywhere near half the battle. Even then, observational moves are an important boon to the MC in these games--they give the MC a chance to establish fiction in a tight context while also giving the MC a sense of how much <i>wasn't</i> picked up on. Miss a move? Well, sure you can develop some nasty surprise as part of hard moves and front moves or off-screen badness or what-have-you in response to any failed roll, but having a missed Read Person roll sets your gears turning and helps you think about the situation in terms of what the PC might doesn't know about this person. Taking away those moves takes away those nice, cozy trigger moments. This holds even if the player doesn't fail and even if there are no moves at all--sometimes there's just no secret until the players start nosing for them and you realize it would be cool if there was something there after all. But the moves make asking questions about the world and the characters part of the player's basic mechanical vocabulary when they aren't sure what they want to do and when we're playing to find out what happens ... players are going to lean on those moves a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423483/#Comment_423483" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T02:33:30+00:00" title="October 29, 2013  2:33AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it took a couple days to get back thanks to a schoolwork-&amp;-stress-induced break from internet communities, but thanks so much for the really thorough response!

I mistakenly copied the original move. For my game, I made some modifications to The Sprawl's alpha state. Here's the move we used:<br/><br/><i>Manoeuvre (Mind)<br/>When you attempt to gain a tactical advantage of an opponent through advanced planning,<br/>careful positioning or clever maneuvering roll+Mind. On a 10+ hold 3. On a 7-9 hold 2. You<br/>may spend 1 hold per to:<br/>*Inflict terrible harm<br/>*Take little harm<br/>*Carry +1 forward on a related action<br/>*Impress, dissuade, confuse or embolden your enemies</i><br/><br/>There's still, as written, mostly fiddling with numbers, but we went with a clock-less harm variant which made the first two less numerical. The third is as before, and the last is super interesting and ended up being used the most. Here, it's a player choice, so picking "embolden" is a tactical decision rather than a tool the MC can use to spice things up where it makes sense. Players used it to cause the enemy to overreach, focus on them instead of allies, and so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423501/#Comment_423501" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T12:42:01+00:00" title="October 29, 2013 12:42PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, yeah, the options read like Seize By Force.

I like the idea of doing stuff not regarding military folks. <br/>The thing I'm struggling with is what exactly makes it Mass Effect in particular. You say it's the world and themes, but I guess I just don't really see them in an obvious way. I think a big part of it is that the games themselves are so caught up in being about a military mission by people who were basically born with guns in their hands. I'd love to see the other stuff get focused on, but since there's so little screen time on that stuff in the games (or at least very little screen time in which there is meaningful interaction) it makes it hard to nail down. I like what you have, but I don't see what makes it Mass Effect rather than just a potentially-interstellar politicking hack (which would be really cool, so don't take that as a bad thing to be).<br/>A big help to seeing those, at least for me, might be if you actually explicitly establish what the themes are that you'd like to handle. It's quite possible that they're all in there and I'm just dense or something.<br/><br/>I think the other main thing that hits me is that it is very Apocalypse World still, mechanically. Each of the basic moves save 2 (one of which is not written) are just slightly altered ApW moves. I like the alterations (especially the new Read a Sitch questions), but ultimately the game still interacts, mostly, with the same basic action types as Apocalypse World, which feels weird to me. For example, if this is as politicking as it seems to be, I would shy away from using Seize By Force mechanically,  or at least relegate it to being a peripheral move. I love the idea of "Doing It The Hard Way," I'm just hesitant about using SBF to do it. I like the addition of Lie Through Your Teeth as a basic move too.<br/>I'm pretty sure you're just not done with the triggers for Intimidate and Lie Through Your Teeth rather than intentionally not having any.<br/>Basically what you have is totally functional, it just reads a bit generic to me still aside from a couple spots.<br/><br/>A couple words of warning on that playbook list. I like the list, it's varied and all the pieces are individually interesting. However, I feel it may be tough to keep multiple folks in the same general group for more than one scenario. The soldier and explorer especially seem like their concepts would be hard to put in the same places/situations as the others without regularly relying on much more specific archetypes (such as a bodyguard-type Soldier). A single scenario is easy to draw in many folks of disparate backgrounds, but it seems difficult to make some of them stick around. that's not to say it can't be done, it'll just require some really intense relationship-establishing material (eg Backstory, Hx).<br/>The other warning is just quantity: I know from experience now that 8 playbooks is WAY more work than it looks. Just so you know what it is you're jumping into.<br/><br/>Those are more high-level things rather than specific mechanic balancing/optimizing. Hope it helps, and I really am interested in seeing how it comes out.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">@Gwathdring</a>: Hey, you've been really helpful about refining the Alien move for my hack. I finally pounded out something new and different for Enact A Crazy Plan. It's a lot simpler, and feels a touch generic to me, but I like it in general and wanted your thoughts on it:<br/><b>Enact a Crazy Plan</b>: When you <i>break all conventions and expectations to do what needs doing</i>, roll + Alien. On a 10+, it gets done, and choose two of the following. On a 7-9, same thing, but only choose 1.<br/>* The consequences are not immediate.<br/>* Your reputation isn't redefined by this event.<br/>* Your teammates are spared the worst of the fallout.<br/><br/>On thing about it is that it is very easy to get what you want with it. You can succeed at some ridiculous crap when you ignore the standard, but it <i>always</i> has consequences. You can forestall them, and you can keep your friends out of it, but they're coming. The reputation one seems like the easy one to not pick, but that can put you in some sticky situations too. But again, while there's always a price, all you need is a 7-9 and your big crazy plan succeeds at its main goal.<br/><br/>So, does it need to be Alien'd up any more, or does that work pretty good?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425078/#Comment_425078" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T02:36:23+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  2:36AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2013 7:36AM by 3Jane.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/3Jane">@3Jane</a>: (kinda assuming you were looking for feedback, my sincere apologies if it was just sharing and you weren't looking for any and just ignore this)</blockquote>\nThank you, I am looking for feedback and it's very valuable for me - I should have said that straight away <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm also thankful for any criticism: I'm not precious about the hack (although I'm also not necessarily going to alter it).\n<blockquote>The thing I'm struggling with is what exactly makes it Mass Effect in particular. You say it's the world and themes, but I guess I just don't really see them in an obvious way.</blockquote>\nI think it's hard to pinpoint because it was deliberately made based on many well-known tropes. At this point, the hack can be used for any political sci-fi - the Mass Effect bits would be the species, the planets and the tech. I'm planning on adding a special move for every ME species.<br/><br/>The other bit I want to add that feels Mass Effecty to me (which isn't fully described in the draft doc yet) is a concept of prices and needs. This'll go somewhere in the principles/threat moves, I guess. I think they're also mentioned in the read a person move. Anyway, in AW you've got simple people being led around by simple motivations. I'm thinking of NPCs in terms of prices (what they want, what you have to do/provide to make them do something) and needs (what they actually need, what they won't tell you because it makes them vulnerable).<br/><br/>Prices don't have to follow "exchange good X for service Y": someone's price may be "make me believe you're a deadly threat so that I won't feel self-loathing when I betray the secrets of my brother". Needs don't have to be obvious either: if you have a homeless guy, his price may be getting him food or meds, but his need may be for respect.<br/><br/>This is the reason for no "persuade" move. It should be reasonably easy to get prices out of people by simply chatting to them. For needs, you have to dig around. (Or make the read a person move, that works as well). Then it's up to the players as to how to use the information. If a player mostly interacts with people using their prices, they get immediate results, but don't gain any allies/friends. It should also skew the universe (as portrayed by the MC) towards uncaring, cynical and pessimistic. Whereas if they fulfil people's needs, they gain allies and reputation, and the universe portrayal should be skewed towards optimistic. That's my version of the paragon/renegade meter.<br/><br/>This also means that fetch quests (your classic RPG do gooder stuff) don't count as paragon deeds. You have to take an actual interest in people (find out their needs) and want to help them and make the world a better place instead of fulfilling your goals, because fulfilling someone's need doesn't guarantee they'll do X the way meeting their price for X does.\n<blockquote>A big help to seeing those, at least for me, might be if you actually explicitly establish what the themes are that you'd like to handle. It's quite possible that they're all in there and I'm just dense or something.</blockquote>\nI should probably write up the principles. My main concept right now is the price/need thing, and that the game should consist of resolving conflicts between factions that have conflicting needs (honest needs that you as a person can identify with; stuff like security, survival, identity, freedom or love).\n<blockquote>I think the other main thing that hits me is that it is very Apocalypse World still, mechanically.

My idea of the perfect hack is Monsterhearts but I'm not sure I'll ever reach that level of perfection <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I may be trying to go too wide there. I am planning to provide support for a primarily shooty group: a Soldier, an Agent, an Explorer and an Investigator can be shooty classes, each in its own way, while an Engineer can provide great support in a firefight (one of the specialties is "being underestimated", which is basically "get the aggro off me"). It's just that shooting isn't a goal in itself.<br/><br/>Here's some example adventure seeds or group types I thought of:<br/>- C-Sec (investigations, negotiations, or infiltration of organised crime)<br/>- planetary explorers for hire (Lara Croft + Burke + Tali = Explorer + Agent + Engineer)<br/>- rescue patrol (ok so I reread the Sector General series recently and it was cool)<br/>- revolutionists (a colonised planet wants to split off the Hierarchy or the Alliance; say they have a Star writer, a Politician leader of the colony, and a Soldier general)<br/>- a crime story: smugglers, a gang fighting for their territory, a merc company<br/>- a journalist uncovering government corruption<br/><br/>The unwritten move (Network) should work a bit similarly to Agent's Backup. It's meant to be the equivalent of Circles from Burning Wheel: find a person who fits your specified parameters.

I figured that Network was going to be about the persuade stuff, but instead not having a persuade move is interesting!

My main concept right now is the price/need thing, and that the game should consist of resolving conflicts between factions that have conflicting needs (honest needs that you as a person can identify with; stuff like security, survival, identity, freedom or love).<br/>That's a cool set of things. This is where I think you might be better-served being more focused: keep these ideas, and lock on to them. Unless you're really into the idea of still being a shooty game, you might de-emphasize that element. It's fine to be there, because the political jungle is a place that gets shooty sometimes, but I think it'd be worth putting it in the back seat. Because while I think the idea of being C-Sec dudes or revolutionaries or the like is cool, they can be shooty guys without significant shooty rules to back them up. From what I can tell, that's not what you're prioritizing with the game, and to me it's always worth being more focused.\n<blockquote>It's just that shooting isn't a goal in itself.</blockquote>\nYeah, if it's not the goal, building the moves about getting what you want, rather than making the goal of the move to inflict harm. \n<blockquote>The unwritten move (Network) should work a bit similarly to Agent's Backup.

So your intention now seems to be about a group who is already established as a team a la MotW or DW, rather than the more separate ApW or MH where location is the main thing that lashes the players together? Cuz my mind was totally more on the latter one when I wrote it. If in an established (if unofficial) group, it sidesteps my concerns. It does imply that the group as a whole has a single unified objective, but that's not a problem so much as just a note.<br/>I kinda was thinking the other way just because that's the route I would take personally with a politicking hack, but I think we're on the same page now.\n<blockquote>I like history in MotW.</blockquote>\nMotW's history is like DW's Bonds, right? If so, yeah, I think I see more what you're doing party structure-wise. \n<blockquote>I may start with just a couple. I will also definitely be using other hacks for inspiration (ok, steal anything useful that isn't nailed down, if the licence allows).</blockquote>\nThat's perfectly fine. I only mentioned it because when I jumped into AvW I had this little list of playbooks and it didn't look too bad and then all of a sudden my foot punched through the ice and I was up to my neck in writing these damn playbooks. It's totally worth it, it's just deceptive how much work it can be to refine eight whole playbooks. And definitely crib from everywhere, especially with basic mechanical ideas.<br/><br/>EDIT: Whoops, didn't even see that post with the move. I like it!

How about this. One of the features which is mentioned but not explored much in the game is that they generally can't/won't lie - apparently if you ask an average Turian directly "did you murder so and so" and they did, they'll admit it despite the potential consequences. The facial tattoos (and the insult "barefaced" or something for a Turian without any) are linked to openness as well: they're not just a display of hierarchy, they're a public declaration of who a person is and whose side they're on (especially important with a history of conflict between colonies). Turians also seem to be uninhibited with their display of emotions, both positive and negative, and it doesn't seem to have negative consequences as it would have among humans (thinking of military stress relief methods here).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425209/#Comment_425209" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T10:26:49+00:00" title="December  4, 2013 10:26AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2013 10:28AM by 3Jane.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[Re: Networking] I confess, I'm not familiar with Burning Wheel!

In BW you also have things which give bonuses and penalties to the roll.\n<blockquote>I suddenly think my understanding is jumping at cross-purposes with yours. So your intention now seems to be about a group who is already established as a team a la MotW or DW, rather than the more separate ApW or MH where location is the main thing that lashes the players together? Cuz my mind was totally more on the latter one when I wrote it.</blockquote>\nGood catch.<br/><br/>See, due to moving around a lot, the only stuff I played for the last six or so years was one-shots (sometimes split into up to 3 games). This means I tend to think in terms of a cohesive group with predefined, strong relationships connected to a single strong adventure seed. (Not necessarily all friendly - rivalries and cross-purposes welcome, thus Burke - the corp guy from Aliens - included in the cosmic explorers adventure seed above). Also probably for personality reasons my thoughts ran more along the line of Ashen Stars - a group of troubleshooters - than Marquis of Ferrara - a bunch of strong personalities with separate goals.<br/><br/>But maybe the hack would be better served with a PvP setup like MH. It's something I have to think about. I completely forgot to come up with PvP versions of lying/intimidation/physical violence moves (and I don't know what I'm going to do with long-term play because I'm not sure I'll ever get to test it for reasons as above).<br/><br/>I pointed to MotW history (which I think does look like Bonds) because I like how it gives specific and charged reasons for connections between characters (MH also does that, but not towards all other characters). I just think having all those connections is more likely to create a charged initial situation, and should work better than creating a loose group of characters, following them around and seeing what happens. Maybe I should look into Smallville for inspiration since apparently that's what it's supposed to do.<br/><br/>And also, in Mass Effect the world is so large and advanced (in terms of transport) that location is not a good delimiter, because pretty much anyone is free to grab their toys and get out of the sandbox if they don't like it. So it can't be a location that unifies the characters. It could be a common boss, an economic resource, a political power source, a common goal, a common ideal, or even common species (Shepard + Cerberus working for the good of humanity despite normally fighting).\n<blockquote>More news with regard to my own hack, I'm approximately 2/3 done righting playbook moves, though no species moves yet.</blockquote>\nIs it available anywhere?

When I think I have a complete draft I'll compile it into an actual pdf document and playtest from there.<br/><br/>I totally missed that detail about the importance of the face tattoos to the Turians! Or maybe I once knew it but forgot promptly. Either way, thanks for bringing that back up, I really like that as a thing for them! Probably gonna drop Disciplined for that because I think "Honest, Dextro, Imposing" is a great lineup. Dextro seems unnecessary at first glance, but it's a cause for interpersonal interactions, rather than just combat effectiveness. If I can make all the species moves about the way they interact with others, that'd be awesome.\n<blockquote>Networking and Circles</blockquote>\nInteresting! My initial encounter with Burning Wheel's fairly intense rules (comparatively) put me off from looking too closely, but that's cool. Put in ApW form, maybe something like this:<br/>When you <i>seek out a past acquaintance for help</i>, roll + Connected. On a hit, you find them. On a 10+ there's no bad blood. On a 7-9, there definitely is, and they want something. On a miss, even if you find them you'll wish you hadn't.<br/><br/>Oh look, a miss clause, I've argued against those recently. I'm willing to propose it here because it doesn't actually say anything happens, it just makes explicit that failure doesn't just mean you don't find them, that there are other things that can happen. The MC(?) makes their hard move as usual.\n<blockquote>PvP vs Teammates</blockquote>\nThat's funny actually - I've played one-shots almost exclusively for almost a year now, and I've done more PvP-type stuff than party stuff. Interesting the different natures of one-shot culture.<br/><br/>Aye - location tends to be central to the <i>non</i>-connected groups. Connected groups tend to have other central ties, such as ideology or goals (that would be the, say, Cerberus group). But if folks aren't connected, it's hard to do it in a more wide-spread way because there's no reason that these people would interact otherwise. A Star from the Citadel, a Soldier in the Traverse, and an Investigator on Omega have little chance for interaction until they all are on Ilium. Even if they had strong predefined relationships (the Star is the Soldier's ex-wife, the Investigator is the Star's brother, the Soldier and Investigator were good friends in high school), there's no interaction without proximity, and non-connected groups don't have a great reason for that proximity without help from the system.<br/>Now, the scale of the "location" is variable. With extreme effort, "the galaxy" can become that location, though you basically have to be the top echelon of society. Celebrity news today is that level of interaction over enormous distance. A ship can be a location, a planet can be, a neighborhood can be.<br/>On the other hand, a group that sticks together doesn't have this location issue. They're bound by a goal, though they likely have additional goals of their own. They can go from place to place and interact throughout.<br/><br/>It's a tricky issue. Both forms of politicking, both vs. MC and vs. PC, are interesting. It's just the stories you want to tell. I'd be interested in either sort of game.\n<blockquote>Initial Relationships</blockquote>\nTrue, MotW ensures a connection to every other PC. It also allows a greater range of possible relationships they start with because not all are selected. MH can focus more tightly on a specific type of relationship (all Selkies have the they-stole-my-pelt story, for example). MH is less work to create (because you need fewer prompts) but also more (because those few have to be pitch-perfect).<br/>Basically they all do slightly different things. The MotW approach is totally valid, but could be tough if you do go the more PvP road. You have options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425422/#Comment_425422" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T23:09:33+00:00" title="December  6, 2013 11:09PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">@Gwathdring</a>: Hey, you've been really helpful about refining the Alien move for my hack. I finally pounded out something new and different for Enact A Crazy Plan. It's a lot simpler, and feels a touch generic to me, but I like it in general and wanted your thoughts on it:<br/><b>Enact a Crazy Plan</b>: When you <i>break all conventions and expectations to do what needs doing</i>, roll + Alien. On a 10+, it gets done, and choose two of the following. On a 7-9, same thing, but only choose 1.<br/>* The consequences are not immediate.<br/>* Your reputation isn't redefined by this event.<br/>* Your teammates are spared the worst of the fallout.<br/><br/>On thing about it is that it is very easy to get what you want with it. You can succeed at some ridiculous crap when you ignore the standard, but it <i>always</i> has consequences. You can forestall them, and you can keep your friends out of it, but they're coming. The reputation one seems like the easy one to not pick, but that can put you in some sticky situations too. But again, while there's always a price, all you need is a 7-9 and your big crazy plan succeeds at its main goal.<br/><br/>So, does it need to be Alien'd up any more, or does that work pretty good?</blockquote>\nThat's a really, really cool move. I don't know that it needs to be Alien'd up exactly, but I would be a bit concerned about the reputation bit. I can see situations where you want your reputation to be redefined by it and situations where you don't. While obviously giving the MC the reigns there makes it potentially bad even when your reputation could theoretically be redefined for the better ... it's a slightly awkward situation for both parties. I love the concept, but the practice of that particular element is a bit awkward.<br/><br/>I want it to work though. I'm playing with it.

You're right about the reputation one of course. The idea that it can be good to have a reputation redefined is slightly mitigated by the MC's control over it (meaning they're the ones who can actually choose to be relatively nice, fan of the PCs / make a move as hard as you like not as hard as you can and all that stuff).<br/><br/>My best thought after talking through some ideas with my brother was to switch the option to:<br/>"<i>* A valued reputation is not ruined.</i>"<br/>With the idea there being multi-parted. On one hand, it's not never a good thing - no one wants a reputation they value to be ruined. On another hand, "a valued reputation" needn't be your own reputation as long as you care about it (and don't we all care about the reputations of our friends, allies, and direct superiors whose reputations can wreck us indirectly?) On a third hand (gosh, are there any ME species with more than 2 humanoid arms? That's a pretty common sci-fi trope to be ignoring, interesting), "a reputation" doesn't necessarily mean your overall sum reputation - maybe your rep with your boss is down the drain, or with your best friend, or with the media, or society, or the council, or whatever. All that matters is that some social standing you actually value is wrecked.<br/><br/>I think that mitigates the more nebulous possibilities of the original reputation option.

One implies that your selections are mitigating risk and that you're plunging into something dangerous in exchange for success at your goal whereas the other implies that consequences stem from failure--that you're barging in but not really beyond your means.<br/><br/>Both can be taken either way, but I'd say the second one (pick more bad things on a 7-9) emphasizes that you're stretching yourself by Enacting a Crazy Plan, whereas the former version implies that while it's difficult and the consequences can be substantial, there's a greater sense of control. Obviously your stat plays a major role here, as does the MC's attitude. But, for example, if I read the two rules as an MC, the second one would ... suggest to me that I should make my "hard as you like" moves a little harder than the first one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425500/#Comment_425500" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T21:13:23+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  9:13PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, it's not even an issue with double negatives, but with options phrased in the negative in general. On a hunch I dug through Johnstone's posts (I knew he was at least part of that thread, and turns out he was the one who I was referring to even!) and found the one I referred to in a thread about writing Apocalypse World playbooks: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/415091#Comment_415091" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/415091#Comment_415091</a><br/>Specifically, these phrases:\n<blockquote>Inspiration likes limitations, but things you can't do are like the edges of a blank piece of paper. Your inspiration is better off starting with a drawing of anything on that piece of paper than worrying about its size and dimensions.<br/>******************<br/>Negative options are constraints that you have to struggle to get away from. They aren't constraints you can riff off of.<br/>******************<br/>Write moves that produce fiction, or that influence the players to create fiction, or that spur characters into action in the fiction. Stay away from moves that shut down options without also doing one of these things.</blockquote>\nNow honestly I'm kinda feeling pretty decent about even the negatively-phrased options still being pretty good at producing fiction, so this is a little superfluous (though since it's relevant here I wanted to share it anyway - it's a pretty awesome thread and is totally relevant to those who want to write playbooks. I need to give it another read-through myself).<br/><br/>In light of that, and I like the idea of less sense of control, I'm gonna go with that second one.<br/>How does the third option sound in wording as the inverse of "Your teammates are spared the worst of the fallout"? I feel like the new version has different implications there. Does "Your teammates are in just as much trouble as you are" work, because I think that's more in the spirit of what I'm going for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425505/#Comment_425505" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T22:46:07+00:00" title="December  8, 2013 10:46PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2013 10:48PM by Gwathdring.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a very interesting thread.

The new one ("just as much trouble as you are") implies your team-mates are only in trouble if you a) involve them in the Crazy Plan to begin with, the MC makes a hard move, or you drag them into it by selecting that option on a 7-9.<br/><br/>In light of that, I really like that re-wording.

I'm gonna bust open the airlock doors for a second so the enemy gets sucked out into space (this is a space setting isn't it?). I figure my team will all know to hold onto something, right? They better.<br/><br/>Just the 10+ results, to keep it simpler. Other GMs might do these all differently, but here's my take.<br/><br/>1.<br/>Okay, with the positive move, let's say I choose a rep to be ruined, because I really want the plan to work and fuck everything else. The move tells the GM that the plan works but a rep is ruined. As the GM I probably say the team thinks you are reckless now, you almost got them all killed. Or just one teammate (the important one) thinks that.<br/><br/>If I make essentially the same choice with the negative move, it tells the GM that I'm opening the air lock to send the enemy out into space but the consequences are not immediate and my teammates are spared. As the GM, I'm kind of baffled as to how that happens, but I might say that the enemy gets some shots off (while you and your teammates get a hold of something) before being dumped into space, maybe. The upside maybe is that your rep isn't protected, so I will evaluate what all the NPCs now think of you separately.<br/><br/>2.<br/>What if the player chooses the consequences are immediate? As the GM, I figure, yeah, the consequences <i>for you</i>. Roll to see if you go flying out into space along with the enemy. You can't hold on and punch a keyboard at the same time. No rep is ruined, but no rep is saved either, so I think I would evaluate for the NPCs based on the results.<br/><br/>With the negative move, the same choice says that your rep is protected and your teammates are spared. Okay, so actually maybe this version is a bit better for you? I'd say your teammates are fine, you're not. But they still think you're cool if you <i>do</i> survive. So it takes out the role-playing of each of the NPCs maybe.<br/><br/>3.<br/>And if the player chooses to throw their teammates under the bus? Cool, they all have to roll or get sucked out. They will definitely hate you later. How could your rep not be ruined? Oops, you just picked two choices by mistake! Or maybe not, I suppose, and that's just in this instance. Other times they might not know it was your fault. This example is just not a good time to pick this option.<br/><br/>With the negative move, it tells the GM that the consequences are not immediate and that your rep is protected. Which actually sounds completely different than what the positive move dictates. As the GM, do I then maintain a slight pause before the airlock opens and decide how each NPC reacts? This has the full possibility of allowing the subsequent events to totally derail the crazy plan. Or do I say it totally works right now, but you get court-marshalled for it later, because it's totally illegal and/or reckless? But of you go up before a trial board for endangering your crew, they will stick up for you because your rep is intact. I can't tell if this is better or worse, but it seems a lot more convoluted and like it could turn into a scene resolution thing.<br/><br/>Final score:<br/>Seems to me like the positive version gives me clear results, but the negative version makes me think about what's going on more. If I'm not doing that thinking already, the negative version might actually be better. But if I'm already considering things closely, the positive version gets me to the results quicker and then I can ponder the ramifications after we know what happens right away, not in the middle of that. Which is pretty much what I was trying to say in the other thread: with one we get to the results and then I think "hmm, what happens because of that?" and in the other, I'm doing some of that thinking before the outcome is announced. So perhaps the positive version applies itself better to a wider range of GM styles.<br/><br/>On the other hand...<br/>Going back to Ghost/Echo for a second, you might be able to get a fun kind of guessing game going on with a negative choices move like this if the GM picked the consequences before the roll but didn't reveal them. Then you pick based on what you think is going to happen. Guess right and you make all the consequences impossible by saying they can't happen. Pick wrong and you make stuff that isn't going to happen impossible. It could be like a variation on the workspace rules, but with the added step of the player getting to cancel some requirements (I did this in Black Seas of Infinity), only the two sides make their picks independently. Dunno how well that would work, but this made me think of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425529/#Comment_425529" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T06:32:34+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  6:32AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey,<br/><br/>let me analyse the options in your move.

I guess I disagree that they make the core of the game during the design. Just as there are many, many ways to plan out a novel, there are many equally viable ways to plan out a game. Even at play, the core of the game is whatever your group really groks to be the core of the game. For me, what has always made Apocalypse World and associated hacks sing is the moves, playbooks and a discussion during the first session that gets everyone on the same page--lines and veils, general discussion, FATE-like collaboration, a microsope-style palette, or whatever. I suppose I could agree that <i>having</i> principles is essential as it guides the MC's relatively free-form behavior, but what they are in particular isn't as important to me. Everyone is going to interpret those principles differently anyway--having them be straightforward and evocative should thus be sufficient. I also find that on analysis, it is the wording rather than the core idea that makes most of the Apocalypse World principles .... Apocalypse-World-y. This isn't a knock against the principles by any means, it's just that I think the principles and the MC's movelist work rather generically well and it is the wording that points the MC in an Apocalypse-World-y direction. Take "Barf Forth Apocalyptica." There's no WAY you'd want to avoid "just" rewording that. Every game that doesn't completely restructure the GM's role wants to insist that the GM bring the world alive at every turn, using their style of language and description to evoke the setting like they're popping the perfect color-filter on the camera and focusing on all the right parts of the scene. Of course you want to "just" reword that! That should be in pretty much every hack that isn't trying to radically change the role of the GM which is pretty much every hack.<br/><br/>Most of the rest of the principles aren't even flavored. Remember, a lot of people hack this game because they feel the MC-Player relationship is great and they don't want to screw with it too much. The only AW-y principles are the aforementioned, Look Through Cross-hairs and Respond with Fuckery. Everything else is (in a good way) relatively generic. If your point, though, is simply that hackers should <i>consider</i> rewriting the MC's actual role and focus in the game, then it's a good point. But if your point is that the AW principles are finely tailored to details of the setting and the game that don't belong in most hacks ... then I really, really, really disagree.\n<blockquote><br/>This means you have some teammates around to begin with when you're enacting a crazy plan. It tells me something about how the game is meant to be played (in teams). However then the move doesn't apply to non-team actions or PvP.

If the person is an NPC, this is essentially "taking their stuff away".</blockquote>\nI agree with you about the implication, but not the application. "Your Team" can be abstracted fairly easily; I guess rewording to "your allies" or your "confederates" or something might make that abstraction more clear.  If having a team of some sort is supposed to be part of the setup to the move, than that should be included in the "When you ...." text, but otherwise I don't think the rewording fixes anything. That leaves you in a similar position where it's implied that a crazy plan always puts someone you rely on or care about at risk--is this particularly different from implying that it always puts "your team" at risk? It has different connotations but I don't think it solves the problem you've identified, just changes the angle at which that problem is perceived. There's still a hidden "cost" to engage with the move properly and that is that there needs to be some way to put someone other than the player making the move at risk as a result of the move otherwise the costs are somewhat meaningless and the move isn't properly engaged.\n<blockquote>If Enact a crazy plan is not a peripheral move then there may have to be a lot of these reputations to be ruined.</blockquote>\nThere might simply be a abstraction/terminology problem here. The move works if "reputation" is not jargon for "thing you have [Hx-like-thing] with" but simply means "reputation." Just as "your team" works if "your team" is not code for "the other players and associated NPCs with whom you form a party that works explicitly and directly together most play sessions." There are always reputations to be ruined if you're dabbling in space politics and you have connection to other players and NPCs.<br/><br/>But I suppose point taken in that it has to be in the principles, then. Something about making the galaxy a web of relationships; making those PC-NPC-PC triangles, and making sure that the characters know that connections are how things get done in the galaxy.\n<blockquote>I'd suggest "the negative consequences are immediate".

However, the incredible potential to take that baseline and axe some and add others to drastically alter the play environment (as Monsterhearts and Sagas do) cannot be ignored. That's my next project, to develop what matters to me.<br/>Mine will share a lot with ApW by virtue of being action games. But I expect 3Jane's to be quite different from mine.<br/><br/>The analyses are great (Johnstone hit the nail on the head, and based on that I'm going with the positive one). One thing I'd point out is that trouble falling on your teammates needn't actually require their presence or participation, though you're kind of an extra special dick if you drag them down. Also, just because consequences are immediate doesn't mean there can't also be consequences later, so it's okay to hold off on the hammer on the friends even if they picked both of those.<br/><br/>As for the two definitions, Your Team and Reputation. You're right that rep is NOT a mechanical currency or value, it's just your rep. And yeah, there's gonna be a lot of wrecked reps, and I'm okay with that. It's up to the MC to make the players feel that rep falling apart. Also, side note: ruined is not the same as irreparable. If they really value it, they can restore it, but it's hard.<br/>Your Team is a bit tougher. On one hand, it's slightly jargon-y for the other PCs, who are explicitly team members by definition. On the other, it's totally cool to not use it as jargon and just as the people you're working with. I would say that the MC can use it either way when it shows up, whichever feels more appropriate. I still might reword it though if I can come up with something clever-sounding.<br/><br/>And yeah, good catch on the consequences - the word has a negative connotation to me, but not necessarily to everyone. Is there a good one-word synonym for "negative consequences"?<br/><br/>Thanks for the help refining this stuff!

In what way? Misdirect, name your character's, disclaim decision making, address the characters ... I don't know, I think it would be a stretch to call any but the three I identified genre-y. And the three I identified show up in Monster Hearts, too, but reworded.<br/><br/>I don't mean that as a slight, either! The rewording is <i>brilliant</i> and really makes the game pop off the page and helps it take over the MC's mind. But saying that "Treat your NPCs like Stolen Cars" isn't a rewording of "Look through Crosshairs" or implying that rewording the AW principles is insufficient when it can clearly make such a huge difference in how the principles read and feel would be ... well, I think it's silly. That's why I was a bit ... aggressive in my stance. Because I feel that calling it "just" rewording is really unfair. "Just" rewording the principles can have a <i>huge</i> impact and it would be a shame to dismiss that as though it represents an inferior design motive.<br/><br/>I totally agree that you <i>can</i> write principles that contain in them a radical seed of change. The principles are very important; I don't mean to say they aren't. But you can plant that seed with a careful rewording, not just with deletions and additions. <br/><br/>I also feel (this not in response to your post, but reiterating my earlier one) that claiming the principles are the core of the design is more a personal taste/procedure/style thing than a more solid and general theoretical assessment of Apocalypse World which is how I felt it was presented--forgive me if I was presumptuous in feeling that. For a lot of players, myself included, the more mechanical aspects of the system of Apocalypse World is what make it really different from playing FATE or D&amp;D--not the principles. Just so, the Playbooks and Moves are what make the hacks really pop and sing and feel different from each other. But the principles certainly help, core of the design or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425682/#Comment_425682" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-11T13:21:44+00:00" title="December 11, 2013  1:21PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno. I kinda find that, once reworded, they not only change words but also the actual essence. So yeah, rewording the ApW ones is a strong move for sure. But I dunno. I think we're already on a higher level of thought than what was being described with "just" rewording - it's important to not "just" reword what's there without understanding the exact implications of the new principles, and that the originals did have implications that we may not want.<br/><br/>I mean, there's a couple levels of genre'd in the Principles. On one level, the genre is post-apocalypse. On another, it's an action game, but not necessarily a post-apoclayptic one. And I think there's a level of obfuscation in the writing of the moves - they're very distilled to very basic wordings, not evocative per-say. I see it even more in the Moves I guess than I do in the principles.<br/>Principles: Barf Forth Apocalyptica for sure. It's easy to interpret this in a generic way as filling the game with genre stuff and cultivating the imaginary environment, but that's already re-wording it - as it stands, it's post-apocalyptic in the extreme.<br/>Look Through Crosshairs: See, this also hits the same ultimate purpose as "like Stolen Cars," being that you shouldn't get attached to anything. But I think the difference between them is substantial, in that what LTC says to me is that this is a world where death comes easily. Anyone can be killed at any moment, the MC is always watching ready to kill. It's about death. Stolen Cars is not about death in the same way, it's about burning bright and fast, which is a really different thing. The rewording of this one especially has a huge impact on the game.<br/>Naming Everyone, Make Everyone Human: This is <i>definitely</i> specifically about the game, but not about post-apocalyptic media as a whole. This is about how the game is a community. Everyone is a person, and it's visceral and dangerous and messy when you fall into conflict, and no one is okay to just idly. That's vastly different from making monsters human and making humans monstrous, from giving everyone a history.<br/>Responding with Fuckery and Intermittent Rewards: Yup, that's about scarcity and a world that hates you. None of the others have this one really.<br/>So yeah, not that many in the Principles. But the Moves to are often genre'd. Trading harm for harm, capturing someone, making them buy, activating their stuff's downside, all are genre'd to me.<br/><br/>Ultimately, yeah, it's a bit of a taste thing for Principles to sit at the core of your hack. On the other hand, I myself do consider them extremely important - they determine how the world works. They provide a baseline upon which the characters, their playbooks/stats/moves, will grow from. It's important to know even before doing moves if the world is hyper-lethal to ordinary folk, to know if it's about melodrama or realism, about what contexts people fight in. Those ideas guide the writing of the moves, whether they are intentionally out of the ordinary or match the world's tone. I think that even when I write the stats or moves first, I have Principles in mind, even if not in concrete form. When I wrote AvW, on day 1 I knew that violence was never started just for violence's sake, and that guided my decisions on the basic moves. In this case, we have some principles pre-installed in our understanding of how the Mass Effect world works, leaving us just to figure out which parts we really care about.<br/>But yeah, this is all theory-craft anyway - in the end, all the bits are important, and the early stuff may be changed to reflect later writings if necessary, so order is kinda just whatever.<br/><br/>******************************************<br/>Hey look, I wrote some basic principles! This was kinda off the top of my head, it's not complete, but I'm still interested in thoughts.<br/>Principles:<br/>* Start and end with the fiction. This is self-explanatory I think.<br/>* Breathe life into the shining void. The galaxy is big and empty-looking, so go out and fill those stars with civilization. <br/>* Be up front with the truth, encourage questions. Complete. Truth.<br/>* Address yourself to the characters, not the players.<br/>* Make reputation matter.<br/>* Make the galaxy familiar, but strange. Everything about Mass Effect society is kinda close to something we know, but never quite the same, even Earth in the new context of a living universe. <br/>* Aggravate the tensions of a diverse society. The galaxy  is full of life, and where there is life there is conflict. The species, the governments, the planets, no one is at ease with literally everyone else.<br/>* Think ahead, and offscreen too. Think ahead doesn't mean pre-plan, it means to keep an eye open for things you can do soon. Just don't get attached.<br/>* Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.<br/><br/>The moves I have in my pile are:<br/>* Make them pull together.<br/>* Drive them apart.<br/>* Present an oopportunity, with or without a cost.<br/>* Tell them the consequences and ask.<br/>* Foreshadow future dangers.<br/>* Deal harm, as appropriate.<br/>* Put something they care about in the firing line.<br/>* Put their loyalties at odds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431892/#Comment_431892" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T11:27:12+00:00" title="April 30, 2014 11:27AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RISE, YE DEAD THREAD<br/><br/>This project as typically been out-prioritized by Avatar World for me, but now that that's in a lull I've been working on it again.

Other than that? Not a change to be found, rules are exactly the same.<br/>Obviously that doesn't work for a lot of what we want to do with the Mass Effect hacks a lot of the time. It's a very specific setting in a lawless and resource-scarce place with an immense power vacuum. That doesn't know how to handle the more team-based thing I have in the works, or the sort of political stuff 3Jane had, or whatever. But it goes a long way to show that simply setting-shifting a hack can totally work for Mass Effect, and makes me wonder if I'm being too specific and granular when I work.<br/><br/>The other big surprise to me was the mention that Adam Koebel has been playing with an ME-inspired hack of DW. Has anyone been following him on G+ enough to know what's goin' on there? I'm curious if he or Ryan have thoughts that we're maybe looking past or around in our own hackwork.<br/>(does anyone know if they have accounts here we can summon into this thread with the @ thing?)<br/><br/>Anyway, just wanted to share that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432894/#Comment_432894" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T13:38:31+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  1:38PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't actually play the Omega AW-setting.

If you think there might be a chance to play it sometime loop me in, I'd love to be a part of it (I'm a Tacoma guy, but popping up to Seattle ain't tough).<br/>And even without being played, just as a thought thing it's a great reminder that sometimes you don't NEED a whole change of the game mechanics to drift into a new setting, so long as the tone fits.<br/><br/>************<br/><br/>Anyway, regarding my hack, progress is continuing. After a rather nasty setback causing the temporary inability to read the content I'd just written, I'm back in my files working for the next step. I'm actually compiling a document in written-as-book style rather than written-as-design-notes, so as soon as I can fill in the blanks I can post an actually playable version of the game! I still need to write a lot of moves, but the fundamentals are in place. <br/>Major changes so far:<br/>* The Ship mechanics are all worked out. I don't know if they're statistically perfect, but I like them, which I'm thankful for given that this is the fifth entirely different take on it I've tried. The Traits in my previous blog posting still are there, those are about flavor, not mechanics.<br/>* I'm heavily considering changing Loyalty to Trust. While Loyalty is a much stronger word given its literal use in the game series, it has consistently been a nightmare to try and work into sentences.<br/>* I nailed down advancement finally! It takes bits from my Avatar World but does it a little different - the XP-generating traits are attached to moves rather than selected by whim. I feel quite happy with it!<br/>Things I Need To Do:<br/>* Write a lot of moves, for the Rolebooks and Speciesbooks. Also fill out the other little bits on those, like Looks, Origins, and Relationships.<br/>* I need to write a bunch of supporting text for the MC's stuff.<br/>* I need a new name! Mass Effect Hack is descriptive of what I'm doing, but kinda sucks going forward as a real game name. I'm coming up dry though.<br/><br/>Again, anybody interested in news on MEHack that comes more than once every few weeks or months, I'm currently tweeting about MEHack fairly regularly as @ Logbook_Project. But hopefully I'll be back in here within a week or so bearing gifts of rules text!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433006/#Comment_433006" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-25T18:32:11+00:00" title="May 25, 2014  6:32PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2014 6:57PM by Cneph.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * I need a new name!

As I say in the post, "The phrase isn't copyrighted, it implies danger or evil in the galaxy that PCs would be going up against, it clearly indicates the sci-fi nature of the game, and it is an excellent descriptor of the tone of Mass Effect's story, with people, then colonies, then whole regions going dark and silent as the Reapers worked."<br/>My brother thinks there might be a bit of implication of a story that isn't necessarily told by the game, but I'm not sure I see that. Still, worth checking if anyone else gets the same thing.<br/>So, would Among Darkening Stars be the sort of name you might glance at what it is? If you were looking for games that matched some of ME's tone and saw ADS would it draw you in? Is it too vague or too specific, or just kinda generic?

Also, now that you mention it Denys I totally see the horror vibe in the name, and that's not really what I'm going for.<br/><br/>So yeah, Among Darkening Stars will likely not be a final name. It is, however, a pretty good starting place from which to work.<br/><br/>The name of the galaxy map music is a good title, it's called Uncharted Wor- oh wait. Never mind.<br/>Though on the topic of song names, "The Fate of the Universe" isn't half bad. Not great, plus it's literally just ripping straight from the soundtrack (though not necessarily a copyrighted phrase). But maybe it's worth looking in that sort of phrase pattern.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback though!

"Darkening Stars" kind of makes me think of the movie <i>Dark Star</i>, but maybe I'd go with <i>Among the Dark Stars</i>, or <i>Between the Dark Stars</i>. Which also sounds kind of horror, except that <i>Dark Star</i> is a comedy. Also, Sage has his AW hack called <i>Black Stars Rise</i>, which also sounds a lot like my sci-fi AW hack <i>Black Seas of Infinity</i> (and then I have another one, called <i>Evil of the Stars</i>!).<br/><br/>But, you know, space, right? How many things make you think of space right away? Star, sun, planet, world, nebula, galaxy, universe, the blackness of space, the void, lots of space and emptiness, anything to do with light, the heavens, the sky, constellations. Cold, maybe, even though space doesn't feel cold. There's only so much to work with, so sounding similar to something else is probably inevitable.<br/><br/>If you want to avoid horror, maybe go with brightness instead of dark? Bright Star, A Blinding Light, The Shining Heavens, etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, some thoughts.

I'm thinkin' something along that might be interesting. Another thing that's been bouncin' around my head is the use of night as a colloquialism for space, probably inspired at least partially by Firefly's slang of black.<br/>So maybe <i>Into The Shining Night</i> or some such? I like that. Maybe <i>Into The Shining Void</i> gets the spacey-ness across a little faster though. I could totally get into either of those.<br/>The brightness does avoid the horror thing a bit better, there's the space implication, and Into has a bit of an adventurous vibe, plus it's a more active word.<br/><br/>Yup, names are hard indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433539/#Comment_433539" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-07T04:18:31+00:00" title="June  7, 2014  4:18AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2014 4:20AM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW/FYI, titles cannot be copyrighted.

Still working out some details, but if anybody is looking for a Mass-Effect-style Fate character sheet, here is one in progress: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7nAXUqkUHp0aU4xNjlqTm44WnM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7nAXUqkUHp0aU4xNjlqTm44WnM/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>It's very much like a standard Fate sheet except that it has some extra stress tracks (shields, credit, special ammo, and medi-gel) and keeps track of three different fate point pools (thanks to paragon points and renegade points that are earned through compels can be spent as a normal FP with 1, an auto-success with 2, and a success with style with 3).

One-page games are great.<br/><br/>If you're interested in continuing to modify the document itself, there's a typo: "When you accept a failed a roll." On a related note, what do you mean by "accept" a failed roll? Is there a way to reject or alter one that would not result in gaining 1 XP?<br/>Additionally, there might be a better way to explain advantage/disadvantage. It might warrant its own paragraph, or at the very least should be bolded so it's easy to find on the page.<br/><br/>I like the Reputation stuff! Seems fun. I think it might be even better to make the Renegade action be "When you do what you must, DESPITE the cost" rather than "whatever the cost." "Despite" implies that there is always some kind of cost to these actions, while "whatever" can still technically apply to actions without any significant cost, and I think that runs counter to the intention of the mechanic. The Paragon option mandates taking a risk, so I think the Renegade should mandate a cost.<br/><br/>Looks great man, excited to see if you do anything more with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444688/#Comment_444688" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T01:40:39+00:00" title="April  9, 2015  1:40AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the feedback!

(See the "Lucky" ability in World of Dungeons, plus the Interrupts.) You don't get the XP if you don't really fail.<br/><br/>Advantage/Disadvantage had their own paragraph once upon a time. Maybe I'll put it back.<br/><br/>I like your idea on the Renegade phrasing, too. Definitely fits with how we've been using it, too. (You should have SEEN the Renegade points racking up when the PCs decided to turn to Cerberus to help them fight an alien threat because they didn't trust the Council to get the job done.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444704/#Comment_444704" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T10:43:07+00:00" title="April  9, 2015 10:43AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm interested to see how your reputation works out - it reminds me of Nature from Mouse Guard because the Paragon/Renegade score will be such a big influence on the roll. <br/><br/>With how many tokens do characters start the game, if any? Do they carry over from session to session?<br/><br/>I'm guessing that spending a token means -1 to the appropriate score? In which case, when you add your Paragon/Renegade score to a roll, do you take the value from before the token is spent or from after it is spent?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444705/#Comment_444705" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T11:36:59+00:00" title="April  9, 2015 11:36AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2015 11:40AM by JasonT.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, the reputation system is still very much experimental. We have tried it maybe 3 or 4 different ways so far, and this one won't get tested until later this month. Based on feedback from my players and what I feel like I can keep track of, I wanted to come up with something that fulfills the following:<br/><br/>1. We get to pass around little red and blue stones.<br/>2. Interrupts get to majorly influence success.<br/>3. The rules for Interrupts are clear and consistent.<br/>4. You have Paragon and Renegade scores, not just tokens to spend.<br/><br/>So, no, you don't actually lower your scores when you spend tokens. You start at +0 for both (unless you decide you want to do something like Mass Effect 1 and give small starting bonuses based on origin story, but I leave that up to you). Once the scores add up to 10, getting +1 in one score means getting \u20131 to another score, possibly shifting back and forth or maxing one side out at +10 with the other at +0. I estimate that +10 is about as big a bonus as you can give in this system to make it game-changing (effectively like selecting a Paragon/Renegade option in the video game) without being totally game-breaking. We'll see if I'm right. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

I've only ever ended up using the Ultralight stuff, and only with a couple different groups. I revised a bunch after getting a lot of feedback from the first group, and then ran a newer version with a small group of players new to tabletop RPGs. You can see a PDF of that revised version here:  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7nAXUqkUHp0N2hlSGx0V3BrTkU/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7nAXUqkUHp0N2hlSGx0V3BrTkU/view?usp=sharing</a> <br/><br/>The more recent version ended up more detailed in some places, more pared down in other places:\xa0just three stats, but some more guidance for character creation, slightly more detail for powers, some more specific examples for gear, and an advancement system that basically just lets you add tags to powers so the burden isn't on players to write moves themselves. Making up moves ended up being kind of stressful for my players, and just giving them a short list turned out to be more helpful than explaining how and why they're balanced the way they are. Sounds like that may not exactly what you were looking for, but it ended up being really convenient for us, especially with the newbies. <br/><br/>To be honest, the version linked above still feels unfinished to me, especially the paragon/renegade system and some weird quirks of a new layout I slapped together in a night. (Paragon/renegade is mostly just there because we like passing around pretty tokens, and it reminds people of Mass Effect. There's not really a good reason to have 10 boxes for it on the character sheet other than that my wife liked the layout and I didn't have time to change it before play started...) I haven't touched this in a while because both groups I ran it for have had to take breaks for a while.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458958/#Comment_458958" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-02T17:01:22+00:00" title="January  2, 2017  5:01PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the links will enjoy check it out.

"I spend this point and I'm AWESOME" always felt better than "I spend this point and get +2 to my roll/damage/resistance, which may or may not be enough to make a real difference." In a more fleshed out version of the game, I could see taking that further \u2013\xa0like, once Paragon or Renegade reaches a certain score, it unlocks special moves, like how you advance moves in Apocalypse World or get corruption moves in Urban Shadows. We stumbled over everything more detailed than "spend a point, be awesome!" for our wee little games, but I'm very interested to hear ideas on how else it might be approached, if it's an idea worth pursuing at all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458980/#Comment_458980" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-03T22:30:06+00:00" title="January  3, 2017 10:30PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2017 10:30PM by revel911.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just don't want to treat the carrot from the PnR points the same.

We actually tried out a few different versions, including implementations that were more specifically constrained in terms of what you could use the points on. Like, if you were going to spend a renegade point, it HAD to be because you were being a badass/meanie \u2013 you couldn't use it to jump in front of your friend to take a bullet for them. The result of that, though, was that players ended up not spending their points or feeling like they understood how to use them well. Partly they felt like they had to plan ahead to use them, when what they really wanted was a way to improve rolls that went wrong. They like rolling! Replacing a roll entirely with passing a token just wasn't something that occurred to them often. <br/><br/>The way it's implemented now, there's still a narrative component to how they spend their tokens, but admittedly, it's more at our discretion than baked into the rules, and the consequences of interest are more fictional than mechanical. Like, if someone wants to spend a paragon token to improve them shooting somebody, I might prompt them with, "Okay, paragon interrupt! How do you save the day?" And then maybe they'll say, "Hm, actually, I just want to kill this guy, so I'll hold onto this to help somebody later." Or perhaps, "Well, I'm not trying to kill him, just get him to surrender. Can we say the shot doesn't hit him but gets him to freeze so we can talk?" And then we have a new roleplaying situation that leads things more into what they want to actually be doing, which is nice. But yeah, not really baked into the rules.<br/><br/>The tricky thing for me in using any paragon/renegade mechanic is that while I'd like the mechanics to support the story, I want to make sure the "big choice moments" are driven more by what the characters (and their players) think is The Right Thing to Do than by what points they'll get for it. Like, my first group discovered a cybernetic species of robo-bugs that posed a threat to all life, and they needed to figure out how to deal with them. They opted to go to Cerberus for help (renegade) instead of the Council (paragon) because they figured Cerberus would get the job done no matter the cost. And they did, sort of! They figured out how to control the robo-bug menace so it would only attack the targets they chose. Players got their renegade points, but the real consequences were in what happened in the story.<br/><br/>There's probably a good way to make the points themselves matter more, but I have been more concerned with just getting the rules to tell stories that feel "Mass Effecty" without getting too much in the way. I'd be very interested to hear other mechanical approaches, or examples from games that do anything similar very well. I gotta imagine some games have done cool things with special "fate point/plot point/bennies" that tie in more directly with fiction...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461562/#Comment_461562" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-31T23:03:48+00:00" title="March 31, 2017 11:03PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this ultra light hack you have here.
