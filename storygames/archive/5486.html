If you need more detail, let me know. The player is "Bob" and the target, played by the GM in this example is "Sue."<br/><br/>Anyway, I've been increasingly irritated by the way my players get their reward at the end of a session of Contract Work. After they've assassinated a target, they are paid a reward that is divided roughly evenly among them. This is encouraging conservative play instead of risk. Players who hoard money before the payoff, rather than wagering it on risks while on the job end up ahead of the guys risking it on the frontlines. Here's the solution I've been pondering. <br/><br/>All of the wagers in the game are drawn from a central bank. The value of this bank is the total reward for the job. When Bob wants to take a shot at the target, he draws out a bid. Sue does likewise. They then wager against each other. (The bid values are capped by the attributes the players are using. No all-in.) <br/><br/>If Bob wins the exchange, he keeps the money from the bid for his reward money and Sue gives him an advantage for the value of her bid (good as cash, but can only be used later.) Sue then returns the money she drew from the bank. If Bob loses, he returns his bid to the bank, and after smacking him up, Sue returns her money too (otherwise the GM is taking money away from the player's total reward.)<br/><br/>This way players get a reward commensurate to effort and they can play "can you top that" with each other by trying to take on more challenges, which is like the golden rule of a story game. <br/><br/>At least in the sessions I've played with the hardcore. (He made us attack a fox! We're like 2 inches tall and we're fighting a fox!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
