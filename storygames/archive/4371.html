I have lots of notes and a few sections already drafted, but it's about 90% in my head.<br/><sup>2</sup>Part of the design paradigm for Bullseye is that I'm designing it as a transparent text along the lines of a computer instructional manual. The outline will be the table of contents. Each section will start on a new page. No illustrations whatsoever. That sort of thing.<br/><sup>3</sup>I really hate these terms. (Representing checks made against target numers versus opposed checks.) They're not particularly descriptive. They're not even parallel. Any suggestions for alternates would be greatly appreciated. More generally, using the "perfect" word for each game term is one of my nigh-unattainable goals. Comments regarding my choice of terminology are also greatly appreciated.<br/><sup>4</sup>Any other suggestions for specific sub-systems to cover in the text would be greatly appreciated.<br/><sup>5</sup>In my never-ending quest to make Bullseye as unappealing as possible, I'm including a series of theory-related essays. I'm hoping they'll be both helpful for play and informative of the design philosophy. Any ideas for additional essay would be greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98739/#Comment_98739" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T14:20:21+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  2:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, can you give a little blurb about what the book is about?

It starts with d20 at its most fundamental. But I've taken it completely apart, stripped out everything but the core mechanic, and rebuilt it from the ground up to suit my needs.<br/><br/>The system itself is d20 + relevant modifiers vs. target number or opposed roll. All of the overwrought sub-systems are gone, e.g., grappling, special maneuvers, magic, etc. Everything is "skill" based. That's in quotes because there aren't skills anymore either. No feats. Characters are collections of bonuses and penalties that are relatively free-form in style ala SotC aspects. So, instead of Strength 16, a character might have "Strong as an ox +3" or, more appropriate to say a tall-tale setting, "Strong as Blue Babe +3". Everything is defined by bonuses and penalties, including setting-specific sub-systems, e.g., magic, psionics, super-powers, etc.<br/><br/>The other big mechanical change is spread and depletable resources. Spread is the difference beween the yield of the roll and the target number or opposed check. In conflicts involving appropriate stakes (e.g., combat), spread represents base damage as further modified by weapon lethality and armor. But the game also allows for depletable resources other than health points (i.e., hit points). You could have a game about faith. In which case, characters don't have health points but faith points (or possible both). So, if a conflict involves appropriate stakes (e.g., apostasy), spread would represent depletion of faith points.<br/><br/>My design paradigm is to release the ruleset for free in pdf format, at cost in print format, and then release settings as able. I've been "collecting" really cool setting ideas. It's inspired by (though not entirely similar to) the FATE release paradigm.<br/><br/>Any other questions?

My normal preference is: mechanics overview, character information, full mechanics description. However, because characters in Bullseye are essentially defined by their impact on the resolution mechanic, I didn't think a mere overview would be sufficient to jump into character descriptions. I am not inclined to push character information all the way to the back--say, between 7.0 and 8.0. That's just too far in before the reader gets to it. Hence they ended up where they did.<br/><br/>I'm expecting/hoping this will sort itself out in the writing process. If I feel like I can get a full enough overview in the introduction, I'll probably just bump characters up to 2.0 and shift conflicts down to 3.0.<br/><br/>Anyone else care to chime in on this issue?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98888/#Comment_98888" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T06:17:22+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  6:17AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm asking you to look at your intended audience and ask yourself if they care - will they view theory essays as useless pages they paid for or valuable additions?

I agree that<i>Target</i>is not so nice.\n<p><br/>Some thoughts:</p><ul style="font-size: 85%;"><li>Fixed checks vs variable checks gives you something of the nature of things, but doesn't tell you something else is rolling against you.<br/></li><li>Static checks vs dynamic checks is probably too abstract.<br/></li><li>Universe checks vs entity checks is kind of neat sounding, but not informative.<br/></li><li>Absolute checks vs opposed checks seems OK to me.</li></ul>\nAlternatively, you could make everything an opposed check, in which case all you have to identify is what it is opposed by. Of course, with D20's that makes thinks pretty random at lower skill levels...<br/><br/>That's what I'm struggling with. Everytime I come up with a term pair, one half is doing more of the heavy lifting than the other. E.g., one of the other ones I came up with was focusing on how the result is used: quantitative vs. comparative. Blech. Part of the problem is that, even in an opposed check, the player wants the highest yield possible.<br/><br/>But you've got some nice suggestions there. I have a feeling I won't make a decision on this until the latter stages of the writing process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98890/#Comment_98890" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T06:20:18+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  6:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.
