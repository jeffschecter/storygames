It's great for doing soap operas. Character generation produces the wonderfully twisted little knot of people who all have strong feelings for each other. The play practically writes itself from there. Yes, other games have lifepaths and R-maps, but they don't <i>reliably and easily</i> produce something as great as what you get from Smallville. <br/><br/>In play, the inter-PC relationships and values are always front-and-centre, as they're the core of the resolution. Even before you get to the dice, you're thinking about why your PC will be doing something, and who they're doing it for. And the challenge/rewrite cycle means you're constantly looking to bring in the melodrama as you change your character's beliefs and relationships. Plus, the fact that you get rewarded for taking damage and having it healed means that you want to plow into tough challenges, even if they're tough.<br/><br/>Oh, and it's got some superpowers as well, but you can quite happily ignore them.<br/><br/>We're playing a fantastically low-key, very English game of <i>Littleton</i> at the moment. I'm thinking about using Smallville to run a game of HBO's Rome soon. It'll be ideal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333976/#Comment_333976" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T07:12:42+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  7:12AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes this sounds awesome, but i've never been able to convince any of my players to even look at the damn book, let alone read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil - what sort of changes (if any) would you resort to for doing a Rome game?

I was not going to buy or read either game because of my past experiences with other MWP/Cortex games, but a friend loaned me his copy of Leverage because he wanted me to run it for him for his birthday. I was maybe a third of the way through reading it when I decided I needed to buy my own copy.

Obviously, you drop all the superpowers and substitute other traits for the increases during chargen. <br/><br/>One change in play is to think of a way to encourage the sex that was in Rome. I was thinking of having a new Distinction for that:\n<blockquote><cite>Distinction: Good in Bed</cite>Your sexual prowess allows you to both pleasure and manipulate your partner(s). Roll this when you want to extract a boon with sexual favours, cement an alliance with sex, learn something juicy from pillow talk, or just have a good time.<br/><b>d4 trigger:</b> Earn a plot point whenever you narrate having sex with another Lead.</blockquote>\nThe other thing important in Rome was the clash of armies and the geo-political and strategic manoeuvring. So, Smallville will need a mass combat system. How do to that? Hmm...\n<blockquote><cite>Distinction: Army</cite>You have an army!</blockquote>\nOK, it needs a few triggers, but that's your mass combat system. Just use the Distinction like any other.<br/><br/><br/>I've also been asked to say more about Littleton.

Prior to that I was managing editor and a contributing designer, as well as line developer for the last few Dragonlance d20 projects. My first big project as lead was the Big Damn Heroes Handbook for Serenity (at the end of the product line), for which I specifically directed writers to go a little indie and play with new narrative ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we acquired the Smallville and Leverage licenses I decided to use the opportunity to update the basic Cortex rules and embrace the whole "system matters" philosophy I'd been seeing in the small press and indie community. I figured we should be designing the games from the ground up for each license or property. I was aware of criticisms of our older games, and I also wanted to put some distance between Cortex and Savage Worlds (which is doing just fine all by itself).<br/>\n<br/>\nEven before I started work with my design teams on the projects I settled on some changes that are shared between the Cortex Plus games. I threw out the d2, eliminated "Life Points," increased the potency and importance of Plot Points, removed fixed target numbers, and settled on the "roll a bunch of dice but keep the best two added together" mechanic. I didn't want the advantages/disadvantages model which so many other games had (like Unisystem and Storyteller), and wanted to cap dice ratings to d12 instead of going to the d12 + d2 and d12 + d4 thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Leverage, I had Fred, Rob, Ryan, and Clark tossing great ideas into the mix to develop how the capers and heists of that property would work, how characters would be modeled, all of that. The Quickstart Job was our initial design and even that had numerous iterations. For the rulebook, there were more layers of revision and changes that drew on how things were going over on Smallville. The end result resembles Smallville in many ways but flips some expectations completely, which I like.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmallville benefited from Josh Roby going completely bananas with cool story and narrative ideas which I would then drag back toward mainstream or, upon further reflection, restored to their hippy status. It was a great collaboration. We're really nothing alike in design but it helped tremendously. Even better was what happened when it was heavily playtested by various groups. One group actually fed us the idea of ditching Attributes and Skills completely. Neither Josh nor I had entertained that idea, really, but once it was put into practice we were huge fans of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor each game that we produce now, I start with the Cortex Plus skeleton and the language we use to describe it, and push it in the direction of expected play. Dragon Brigade, our first real fantasy setting (albeit with airships and muskets) is a very swashbuckling romantic intrigue kind of thing, so it's got different requirements than either Smallville or Leverage had. And so it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCortex Plus games are tied to licensed properties but they have great potential beyond those licenses. People have been using Smallville to run games inspired or even directly modeled on True Blood, Deadwood, various Smallville-style DC or Marvel takes, the Tudors, Zelazny's Nine Princes of Amber, Glee, Roswell, House MD, and many other homebrews. Rob Donoghue has hacked Leverage in all manner of ways as seen on his blog. And the upcoming Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide is an anthology of hacks of all kinds, including a Roman hack for Smallville by Shreyas Sampat, which is awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's why I think our games are awesome. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334360/#Comment_334360" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T16:59:32+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  4:59PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Are you playing Angry Birds while you make out with me?"<br><br>"Maybe?"<br><br>"Do you wanna look at my abs again?"<br><br>"I guess."<br><br>*shows abs*<br><br>*admires...then slowly raises phone to play Angry Birds while looking*                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334362/#Comment_334362" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T17:03:57+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  5:03PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil</cite>OK, it needs a few triggers, but that's your mass combat system.

A troop of spearmen, a detatchment of Lcavalry, etc. could all have different SFX that would allow you to make sweeping effects at the cost of a Plot Point!<br><br>Anyway.<br><br>So, i'm a Smallville Survivor. I checked out the show for two seasons, and when it was good it was good (mostly some season 2 eps), but when it was not-good it was very not-good. I think, like so many modern dramas (only moreso) the creators have a killer concept on their hands but don't know how to handle it. ANy time I see a show like that, it triggers the thought in the back of my head: "Man, I'd love to play this as a PTA game so it would be AWESOME."<br><br>Well, the Smallville RPG does that. If you like Smallville, awesome, it lets you do more of that. If you've ever cringed at Smallville, awesomer still, this game will allow you to surpass it. Sure, you could p-lay PTA instead. And for some groups that would be the right call. I switched my Smallville New Mutants group to PTA after two sessions b ecause 3.5 of the players were allergic to the rules details and dicehandling that Smallville requires. But for a group that doesn't mind some crunch with their drama Smallville has a lot going for it.<br><br/>Most of its strong points have already been hit on. The lifepath development plus relationship mapping is solid gold, and even my crunch-leery group loved that. It really puts you on a solid footing with who your character is, and how they relate to the other cast and the world. And as JD said, each and every single action yo take in the game has why you're doing it baked right into it. All the statements you write, for your six values and every relationship on your sheet, are like Burning Wheel beliefs in the way they give you and the rest of the table a handy guide to what your char is about, but with a really neat system for challenging and changing those statements. It MAY even be better than Key buysoffs. <i>Maybe.</i><br/><br/>And the contest system is intriguing. In addition to the In a Wicked Age back and forth that Jamie brought up, it also carries echoes of Dogs in the Vineyard: Escalate or Give, Esacalate or Give, until someone either backs down or suffers fallout. And the "fallout" is Stress in the form of Angry, Insecure, Injured, etc. SO you argue or fight, until someone either convinces the other, or else loses their temper/gets punched out/flees the room in tears.<br/><br/>This last bit makes it particularly apt for soap opera, and is the biggest "TV Drama" thing you don't get from PTA. You're not just roleplaying and drawing for Stakes (or to answer a question," as in the PTA3 playtest rules)...you're speficically driven toward <i>getting up in everyone's grill</i>--your friends, family, enemies and frenemies--and convincing, cajoling, browbeating and pleading. Basically, you exacerbate tensions in a bunch of brittle relationships, to try to get what you want. And at least half of these confrontations will end without the central goal resolved, but with the relationship escalated, beliefs challenged, and important things said and done that can't be taken back. Perfect soap opera.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334366/#Comment_334366" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T17:25:38+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  5:25PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty much what Cam said.

Could someone explain<i>how</i>the<i>Leverage</i>rules help the group get to this kind of fictional position and drive it home?<br/><br/>It shoots for this on a number of levels. Rolling a 1 on your dice invites the Fixer (GM) to hand you a Plot Point and create a Complication, which is a temporary Trait he gets to roll in against you. The Complication has a name (like "Suspicious Guards") and a rating (starts at d6). The table can acquire a number of these as the game goes on. Plot Points can be spent on Assets, which are a player's version of the same thing, representing favorable circumstances, improvised tools, lampshaded objects, etc.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are invoked by other players or can be activated by Plot Points, too. They let the players fill in the blanks and establish heretofore unrevealed truths about the timeline. At the end of the Job, the Mastermind player may also conduct a wrap-up flashback which involves all of the other players narrating flashback scenes, rolling dice to see if their flashbacks can generate bonus dice for the Mastermind, which he often needs to oppose the Mark's big pile o' dice.<br/><br/>Many of the Crew's Talents are specifically team-oriented, like being able to create bonus Assets for other Crewmembers, pass around Plot Points, trigger cool events, and so forth. Crew competence is reflected by a general assumption that no roll leads to a dead-end failure, merely a disruption in the plan. And so forth.<br/><br/>Leverage is, above all things, a game about being part of a team of bad-asses who face mounting complications and trials but will, in all likelihood, prevail. It's how that happens, and where the narrative goes, that is often the most fun part of the game.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Cam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bazin" title="Bazin"><img alt="Bazin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bazin">Bazin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334625/#Comment_334625" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T08:22:40+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  8:22AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, this thread has me pretty amped up about giving Leverage a shot, though I do have one more question about it (and since this is Story-Games) is there shared narrative control in either of these titles?  How key is that to the system?  Can you provide examples if there is?<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask because I've really struggled in getting my players to take the reigns in some other games (such as Spirit of the Century) but they did ok in others (Cold City).  The preference seems to be more typical GM-player relationship.  So what's that interaction like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334628/#Comment_334628" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T08:31:10+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  8:31AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only shared narrative control elements are:<br><br>* When a complication comes up by someone rolling a 1 (and this can be in both Smallville and Leverage), the table is supposed to quickly brainstorm to figure out what it is. The GM has the final say and if nobody can come up with one there doesn't have to be a complication.<br/><br/>* Players can create minor useful details in both games with in-game currency, similar to Adventure!'s dramatic editing.  It's optional, you never have to do it if you don't want to.<br/><br/>The BIGGEST shared narrative control thing (by the way, shame on you for this terrible piece of jargon even though I knew what you meant) is in Leverage, at the end of the caper, each player has a flashback showing "what REALLY happened" - planting a bug on a bad guy during a fistfight or putting something in a safe rather than taking something out.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bazin" title="Bazin"><img alt="Bazin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bazin">Bazin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334636/#Comment_334636" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T08:43:23+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  8:43AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh - sorry for using dirty words!

If you've got your Armor Class and I've got a d20 roll, are we "sharing" that narrative control? Yeah, probably. <br><br>But what you're talking about is situations where a player is asked to narrate/describe something outside the capabilities of their character(s) to control inside the fiction, like writing a background ("you can't say your family was wealthy, you were just a TINY BABY at the time!") or gaining narration rights in Primetime Adventures.  I don't know that that's properly called "shared" when only one person has it at a time?  But yeah, I knew what you meant, no harm no foul.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
