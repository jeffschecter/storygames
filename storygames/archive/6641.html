Additionally it opens the door to some expectation violating possibilities...like Gold Dragons who are Evil and Red Dragons who are Good (or at least not Evil).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we define bigotry as seeing people as a label rather than as an individual, than historically D&amp;D; has been pretty bigoted.  Not only did the game label certain people as "evil", but it labeled entire species as "evil"...and provided irrefutable proof in the form of unerring spells to back it up.  So its not just our differences in ideology that lead me to see you as evil...its the fact that you are, unequivocably, evil...my Detect Evil spell says so.<br/>\n<br/>\n4Es new system, while of course simplistic, at least allows us to have individuals who are motivated by individual motivations rather than alignment stereotypes.  Of course, the first module doesn't take advantage of this...its pretty much "these guys are 'good' and those guys are 'evil' and it says so right on their character sheet.  But I'm hoping that additional modules down the road will play up some of this alignment ambiguity more, even to the point of doing a less rail roaded, more Relationship Map driven module where players can decide for themselves who they consider to be the bad guys in a sea of unaligned but powerfully motivated NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile sure we could do all that ourselves...heck, Dogs Town Creation rules could be EASILY usurped into "dungeon" creation rules, or any of the R-Map stuff Jason C. was discussing in the Vampire thread would easily make for the foundation of a good several sessions of play.  But seeing something like that in official WotC product would have more of an impact on how people view what D&amp;D; play is "supposed" to look like...and since I have no desire to ever prep anything for this game, it would be nice to have such a module done for me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147315/#Comment_147315" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T11:56:20+00:00" title="June  2, 2008 11:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the new definition of Evil, and I kinda wish they had called it something else.

(It makes that clear in the Unaligned entry.)  But if you behave lawfully good consistently, on general principle, and when a normal Unaligned person would likely do otherwise, then you are deliberately furthering the cause of Lawful Goodness.  If perhaps you despise most other Lawful Good characters, then you may not be a "team player"; but you are still on the team by virtue of deliberately supporting the cause.<br/><br/>One thing I like about the "team" metaphor is that it allows for people who rarely have reason to behave differently than anyone else but still identify with one alignment or another.  At one extreme you could have, for instance, a demon mother who dotes on her family and community as much as any Good mother would, because she knows what havoc they will reek for her sake.  And when she meets the good guys, she dotes on them too, because it's something she has fun doing, and she has people to do the dirty work for her where she doesn't have to see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147410/#Comment_147410" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T17:17:21+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  5:17PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an ongoing 3.5E game, my DM unilaterally changed my half-orc barbarian's alignment from Chaotic Good to "Chaotic Stupid".

One of the Bad Things(tm) about alignment was that it was knowable with certaintude.  I KNOW you are evil because I cast "Know Alignment" and it says you're evil.  Doesn't matter that your behavior that I've witnessed has been the height of enlightened liberal hippy-ness...I KNOW you're evil.  Aside from making it hard to design scenarios involving bad guys that the characters don't know are bad...its just really...wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying "I KNOW you're evil because I saw you use the &lt;blankity blank&gt; power strikes me as just as bad as a know alignment spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow narratively, saying "I know you're evil because I just saw you butcher babies" that's sensible...you witness someone doing evil, you can say...yeah, that was evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the Evil based powers required actually performing acts of evil (like "kill one helpless innocent for a free healing surge<br/>\n", or "torture someone for 6 straight hours to gain a +2 to all skill checks for the next day) that would at least match observable behaviors with the power, making it less of an arbitrary label and more of an accurate observation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with Good powers, although those would be a bit harder to come up with suitable powers for...they'd have to involve actually doing something that the <i>player</i>* would consider a sacrifice for the benefit of others.  Like "donate 1000 gps or 5% of your total wealth to charity to gain a free healing surge"  Or "forgo all XPs from this encounter to get the ability to Mark a number of opponents equal to your level for the duration of the encounter"<br/>\n<br/>\n*doing good without sacrifice is just normal unaligned behavior IMO                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147714/#Comment_147714" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T13:53:07+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  1:53PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The PHB even hints that, if the characters don't follow the precepts and rules of their gods, the gods don't do anything.

So if being aligned puts you on a team...what does that make the unaligned?  Are they the spectators...or the ball...or the points to score?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I didn't realize that the alignments weren't symmetrical any more, that Chaotic Good and Lawful Evil were no longer options (Lawful Evil was always my favorite form of evil.  I loved putting Lawful Evil characters in positions of power amidst otherwise Lawful Good types...and watch the Lawful Good types squirm cause they couldn't legally do anything about it).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess "unaligned" now subsumes the entire range of behavior from Lawful Evil (I obey the law and so don't do things I'm not allowed to...like committ murder...but within those limits its dog eat dog) to Chaotic Good (liberty first, people second, laws...not if I can avoid them).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can easily see shading the unaligned spectrum a bit.  People who are "benign" (as the article calls them) but really lean towards good...they just lack the will or the moral fibre to actually take the final step of committment being on one end.  People who are not particularly trust worthy or wholesome but largely too afraid of repurcussions to act on their darker impulses and so present a "benign" face to the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where does that leave True Neutral.  Is the active crusader for balance between good and evil no longer a part of the cosmology at all?  I never liked Druids being mandated as Neutral, but I was kind of fond of the idea of having Neutral allies who who'd fight Evil when Evil got too strong, and then turn around and open the door for them when Good looked like it would win.  Doesn't seem to be an easy spot to fit that sentiment...too active to just be "unaligned"...oh, well.  That's a small price to pay I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
