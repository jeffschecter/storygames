                    The closest that I've ever come to a good humors RPG, like a good comedy, is when running the Floating Vagabond. But still, the humor seemed a bit strained. <br/><br/>Does anyone have an good tips on running a comedy game? Or resources?                </div>

                            I've never played an actual "humor game," though I have read a few (Hol and Paranoia spring to mind) and played in games that were only there to make us laugh. Usually when people talk about this the standard items that come up are "you need funny players" and "you can't force the funny."<br/><br/>I think that with a few guidelines one might be able to emulate certain kinds of comedy, especially farces like "Lend Me a Tenor," but you run the risk of producing formulaic crap then.<br/><br/>I guess my only good suggestion comes in the form of a Mel Brooks quote: "Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die."                        </div>

                            We played an otherwise straight-laced fantasy scenario for laughs, once (it was Harkwood, for the other GURPSheads out there).  This happened mostly by accident; my Baron was moronically stupid and the rest of the cast basically chased behind him fixing his faux pas, using terribly inappropriate tools (black powder, seduction, and assassination).<br/><br/>I really have no idea how to produce that sort of play by design, though.                        </div>

                            What a great question.<br/><br/>Much of comedy is about status: sudden drops in status are funny. This is why Paranoia works as a comedy, I think. The Troubleshooters build up status and, suddenly, get the carpet pulled away from under them: either the Computer robs them of status or their fellow Troubleshooters do. Best Friends is funny in a similar way.<br/><br/>I'd imagine that Joshua's Baron is also a status thing. He has a very high status (he's a Baron) which keeps suddenly dropping (he does stupid things).<br/><br/>So, you can engineer situations which are likely to be funny. Joshua's <i>rushing-round-fixing-the-Baron's-mistakes</i> is one. Paranoia's <i>everyone-undermines-each-other</i> is another. You could also try anything else which is likely to feature status drops: Victorian ladies on a picnic attacked by monsters, maybe. Something like that.<br/><br/>And there are also character archetypes that are often used in comedy. The bumbling idiot (Joshua's Baron) is one. There's also the aristocrat, the smart-arse and the dogsbody. You see them in everything, so they'd probably work well in games.<br/><br/>But, yeah, I'm not totally sure, and I'm interested to hear other takes on this.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I think that in RPGs, parody is probably the easiest type of comedy. Sending up typical situations, typical characters, etc. is something that seems to come naturally. Part of it is that many RPGs already rely so heavily on genre tropes, so it doesn't take much emphasis to turn that into a properly absurd situation.                        </div>

                            I would tend to agree with Daniel, the tropes can either be played broadly, My paladin slays people for eating meat on friday even out of lent, or inverted, Dalius is a dirty, hippy elf. As a base that is a great place to start.<br/><br/>The two other things that can make the funny sing are keep it going and keep it coming back. Let things get out of hand, don't worry about wheter it could happen or not let it happen, then take the next idea and pile that on top. this will get absurd very quickly and if you like that sort of humor it should be very funny. then take whatever was funny and keep brining it back. You will see this sort of humor creep into straight games sometimes. "Not more spiders they have kicked our asses every time we've seen them" <br/><br/>Funny is hard when you think about it too much, if it stops being funny try running in the opposite direction for a minute. Say the characters wound up naked after the last run in with the spiders (like ya do) and have to fashion loin clothes out of spider webs. you are all laughed out and not getting any traction with the next bits. again turn it on it's head and try making everyone be very serious about walking into the dukes chamber to announce that the spiders have been defeated in webby banana hammoks see how long you can play it staight and see if they aren't laughing their asses off in moments.<br/><br/>Another thing that might make it easier is to write down a bunch of things ahead of time actions and things on two different colors of notecards. then when things get a little slow pull one and bring whatever ill timed thing in.<br/><br/>Lastly reward each other for the funniest thing. If someone suggests something funny do it even if you were planning to do something you thought was right. Find some way to give out rewards for funny ( and this is the one time I would use something edible for a reward)                        </div>

                            Graham's right, if you observe status and then mess with it it will be funny.  I've also been in "comedy of errors" sessions where things just get played for failure, and the end result is pretty amusing.  But it's a delicate thing and can't be forced.                        </div>

                            Literary comedy is often either about the clash of two discordant elements and the hilarity that ensues (cf. <i>Bringing up Baby</i> or any modern romantic comedy) or a criticism of accepted social conventions (e.g. satire).<br/><br/>The former probably requires less on-the-spot thinking and will run like mad if you prep well enough.                        </div>

<p>Have you noticed that some games are more regularly funny than others?  I was just thinking back on a bunch of actual play and it occurrs to me that I can't help but laugh while playing the Roach or Drowning and Falling.  We used to chuckle when we played HoL, but it wasn't nearly the laughter that reading the game brought or even the regular laughter we get from the Roach.</p>
<p>I'm not willing to go so far as to say I know what the secret is, but I'm willing to bet that Graham is getting warm there.  Something about the sudden and unexpected changes in relationships and attidutes that the Roach requires is regularly comedic.  Or it's the jolt to the comedy-bone that players need to make each other laugh.</p>
<p>Funny players definately helps.  But actual play is telling me that some designs produce more funny than others.  Therefore I believe that it is certainly possible to design for comedy.</p>

                            Yes, what flags a comedy moment?

                            One feature that seems to pop up in our comedy games here is player character backstabbing or antagonism.  Since we normally play very cooperative, often heroic characters, comedy games seem to inevitably involve PvP between selfish, grumpy, conniving, cowardly, or greedy characters.  Though if one player pushes it to far (and is not willing to hose his own character), that can become un-funny as well.  <br/><br/>This is another key feature of our humour games: they're funny when everyone is willing to make fun of their own character as well.  They stop being funny when someone only wants to make fun of <i>other</i> characters.  <br/><br/>All in all, it seems to me humour games are necessarily player-driven, though the GM sets the tone.  You really have to go with the flow while harnessing player energy.                        </div>

                            The essence of comedy is people who take themselves seriously.  Something I've heard from a lot of comedic actors is they never play their role to get laughs, they just focus on portraying their characters.  Their characters don't think of themselves as funny, but the situations they end up getting in are amusing to an outside audience.<br/>
Comedy is also going to depend a lot on the talent you've got at the table.                        </div>

What makes it so funny?<br/><br/>The players.<br/><br/>Great Ork Gods works because it throws away any expectation of seriousness or co-operation. It encourages timely backstabbing, and gives free rein to the players to do stupid, funny things.<br/><br/>The rules themselves aren't funny. The setup is barely funny; but it is free and it lets the players create humour.                        </div>

                            The Mortal Coil game I ran at Dreamation last year was hilarious. It was that status thing, I think. Everyone was playing ancient gods with vast magical power, and what did they do? Make macho postures at each other in a seedy dive bar. Vast cosmic power contrasted with conflict stakes of no real significance whatsoever.                        </div>

                            Brennan, that's interesting. If you start with that set-up (ancient gods in a dive bar), you're basically setting up a comedy game. <br/><br/>It's that contrast between the two social situations: how you expect ancient gods to behave and how you expect people in a dive bar to behave.<br/><br/>I wonder if, generally, you can set a game up for comedy by juxtaposing wildly different situations? If you did a Reservoir Dogs / Sesame Street crossover, for example, you'd be all set up for comedy.<br/><br/>Jack, it's interesting to note that, although you say it's the players that make the comedy in Great Ork Gods, there's <i>clearly</i> something about that game that sets the stage for comedy.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite>Jack, it's interesting to note that, although you say it's the players that make the comedy in Great Ork Gods, there's<i>clearly</i>something about that game that sets the stage for comedy.</blockquote>
Yes. It lets the players make the comedy.<br/><br/>The really important thing to realise is that rules aren't funny. Or at least, they can never be funny more than once. They've told their jokes and now you're bored. Players on the other hand, can be funny every time. You just need to give them a situation that fosters that.<br/><br/>GOG does that in three ways: <br/><br/>1. It lets the players play, and makes it clear that silliness is what is expected from them. Every time they rise to the challenge. I sincerely believe that people are inherently funny; I've never met anyone who couldn't make other people laugh. This part is more difficult I think than it seems: Paranoia and Toon are two cases in point - neither of them are quite as funny as they could be.<br/><br/>2. It rewards players for stabbing each other in the back. This is important, possibly very important. At least half of all humour comes from laughing at other people in one way or another. People laugh when other people fail; this not only provides humour in itself but because people are already laughing it provides momentum for other people to laugh. Great Ork Gods lets you revel in this by pitting you one against another.<br/><br/>3. It doesn't attach you to your character. This ties very closely to the last point. If you fail at something that doesn't matter to you, you can laugh with the other people laughing at you and it becomes funny to everyone; fail at something you really care about and it's not very funny at all and other people laughing at you is only going to make you angry or upset. By making characters disposable, GOG lets you laugh at yourself and laugh with others when you fail. This is vital to stopping the game going sour.<br/><br/>You can't make people funny; and you can't write repeatedly funny material - jokes don't keep on being funny - you need to tap into the humour that players bring to the table and let them express it. You do this be empowering them to be funny; not by making them be funny.                        </div>

                            I inadvertently ran My Life With Master as comedy, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14856;prev_next=next" rel="nofollow">on one occasion</a>. The Shab-al-Hiri Roach, superficially a horrific premise, works out pretty hilariously in practice. Brennan's example of a funny Mortal Coil game (Mortal "blood-and-full-frontal-nudity" Coil, for crying out loud!) is pretty interesting.<br/><br/>One thing I see a fair amount of in RPG play is people using humor as a means to flinch or distance themselves from emotionally intense material. Now, in some games, that's detrimental to what you're going for. But it seems to me that it should be possible to produce a system where players are pushed into dark, uncomfortable situations, and where humor is in fact the encouraged response for diffusing the situation, and get a fairly reliable formula for generating dark comedy.<br/><br/>(The caveat here is my tastes in humor run towards black and dry.)                        </div>

                            Jack, thanks for the explanation. It seems like being able to stab the other players in the back is something in a lot of comic games: Paranoia, Toon, GOG, Shab-al-Hiri-Roach. And maybe to a lesser extent disposable characters is a shared trait by these games.<br/><br/>I wonder how many of your points apply to other comic games? Seems like a solid list.                        </div>

                            After running InSpectres today, I got thinking about comedy in roleplaying again.<br/><br/>Jack is absolutely right that actual jokes in the material are at best only funny once, and the real trick is to get the players to be funny.<br/><br/>This works in two ways - first, you need to <b>enable</b> the players to be funny, and then you need to <b>encourage</b> them to be funny.<br/><br/>Enabling involves things like allowing liberal use of director's stance (letting players introduce funny ideas they have), which InSpectres does ably with both the Confessional mechanics and by giving narration to the player in sucessful (and even unsucessful) die rolls. This power to improvise and control narration and even the introduction of plot elements also naturally creates a highly unplanned, chaotic and thus more humorous story. I think this is also where discouraging attachment to characters can come in - it's easier to laugh at people we have no affection for, including our own characters.<br/><br/>Encouraging ties chiefly into two things - a Situation (eek! Forge terms) which provides material and impetus for funny things to occur, and reward systems which directly reward the player for being funny. In addition, you can simply tell players that the idea is to be funny, but this only works so well on its own<br/><br/>For Situation, it can be as basic as having zany Settings and improbable Characters that encourage players to not to take things seriously in response. More advanced constructions are things like Paranoia XP's placement of conflicting demands on the player - by giving the player multiple mutually incompatible priorities, it encourages players to tie themselves in knots trying to fulfil them all, which encourages humour. This is given extra depth by the inter-player interactions. In InSpectres, the Stress mechanics encourage the GM to pile setbacks and problems on the players, leading inevitably to (hopefully humorous) meltdown.<br/><br/>in terms of reward systems, both Paranoia XP and InSpectres hit upon remarkably similar systems to directly encourage the roleplaying of silly/humorous characteristics (Ticks in Paranoia XP, which earn you Perversity points, and the playing of Traits applied by other players through Confessionals in InSpectres, which earns you Franchise dice).<br/><br/>There's a lot more to analyse in both games - the Perversity system in Paranoia XP in particular is interesting and worth of analysis.<br/><br/>Things that kill comedy include slow pacing, including having to look up rules or any rules with long search and/or handling times. In addition, too much investment in the outcome can kill comedy - you have to have your players in a state where they are willing (and glad) to accept failure. Failure is much more amusing than success.                        </div>

                            I have been thinking about a comedy game called 'What a Shambles'. It is a game about trying to keep your romance going during a zombie apocalypse but I can't figure out how to put it together. I know I want relationships to be important, but not to the point where it gets to0 serious. Players should also be able to betray and screw each other over. System is simple d6 and roll over idea with lots of weapon improvisation to add a bit of slapstick in there. I had this idea for circles representing where an NPC lies in the affections of a PC. The closer the circle to the centre, the more important they are.<br/><br/>I am thinking about getting a playtest version together for Conpulsion and I am open to any suggestions?<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Iain<br/><a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Mob Justice</a> coming soon!                        </div>

                            Hey Iain, you're emulating Shaun of the Dead, right?  <br/><br/>Survival instinct interferes with furthering relationship agenda = funny.  Conversely, relationship agenda overriding Survival instinct = funny.  Competing relationship agendas amid unspeakable horror = funny.  Group survival instinct overriding collective relationship agendas = funny and awesome.  You need to put extreme, ridiculous stress on the dichotomy and it'll be comedy gold.  <br/><br/>Maybe you rank the other player characters in order of intimacy and worth to you (giving you some base-line in interaction perhaps), and author an issue/agenda with each.  Invoking the issue gives you some sort of mojo.  <br/><br/>Ignoring the issue is the only way to be effective on the survival end of things.  But if you don't invoke it regularly, the relationship becomes less important and less mechanically useful, and without strong relationships, you become weak and less determined to survive.  So it's a dubious, no-win infuriating situation, with people you either love or greatly dislike, and zombies.  Seriously, set that up right and you don't need anything else for it to be hilarious.                        </div>

                            i think it's all about perspective and approach.  it's nuanced and complicated...or it's not.  if story, at it's heart is a lie(used to convey a truth), than comedy is bringing out a truth in that lie, or just bringing in a <b>better</b> lie. <br/>it's like trying to explain jazz.  either you see humor in life, or you don't.  what you see humorous in life, that's funny.  <br/>i think Paranoia's much more about people through the lense of bureaucracy, goverment, and technology, than about status.  but really, all these things tie together anyway.                        </div>
