The GM warned me that it might be "hard to play". We just had our season one finale yesterday and at no point did I find the Ghost difficult to play. <br/><br/>Perhaps it's just my play style tends to be somewhat in sync with the Ghost's? Or it could be that I just had a lot of great characters to play off of and a great GM to put things down in front of my Ghost to react to when the other characters weren't there to bounce off.<br/><br/>But I keep coming across the idea that the Ghost is difficult to play and I don't get why they'd be any more difficult to play than some of the other Skins. (I can understand that some of the Skins can be the <i>easiest</i> to play, since their goals are fairly self-defined. Just not why there's the idea that the Ghost is the/one of the hardest.)<br/><br/>On-topic of the link:  That is one of the saddest things I've read. (Though little or no relation to how my Ghost turned out. It's much closer to how our Hollow ended up.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420050/#Comment_420050" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T10:52:16+00:00" title="August 14, 2013 10:52AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2013 10:55AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Ghost requires grokking, in my opinion.

In particular, what's up with the "blamed" condition threw me off a bit, in trying to figure out how the Ghost made use of it. I think it's less obvious what to do with a Ghost.

In the first case I picked murdered in hot passion (one of the two origins I think is easier to roll with), and had the clear outward facing drive of a legion of revenge-focused characters from movies, fiction and RPGs.<br/><br/>In the second case I picked the confused death but had The Mortal, James, chose me, Tien, as their Lover. They were obviously intensely interested in me and it was a fun space to explore. I had a strong image of the character in my head and was enjoying the confusion about my death (which I was not yet aware of) being muddled with confusion about my sexual orientation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa" title="cucumberkappa"><img alt="cucumberkappa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/116/nSJOZL6HNH7NS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">cucumberkappa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420325/#Comment_420325" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T21:21:41+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  9:21PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the thoughts! For context for how my Ghost played out...<br/><br/>My Ghost was aware he'd been murdered (but not of who killed him or why) and the attack was directly tied to why his mother was in the hospital in a coma, but for four years, he didn't seem to feel the urge to find out more. It was a few years of a bit of denial/avoidance of any issues (while simultaneously being bitter over anything that reminded him he was dead). Including his crush on another boy in the class (the Fae). But as the game started, he was slowly forced to face his own death (including brief outbreaks of cold, frustrated rage when confronted with violence or put into his Darkest Self), though it took until the season finale for him to discover who killed him, what happened to his body, and how he could save his mother. And I think even <i>that</i> was because he was pretty well dragged over to see his own body and sat down to be told about what happened. He was too distracted by the crazy things going on to have much time to focus on himself, what with child services figuring out he's been living four years on his own and placing him in the foster home where his even more awkward new friend (the Hollow) lived, the Ananzi meddling, the murderous Queen looming, and the Fae getting entangled in it all, and his best friend (an NPC we eventually find out is a witch) being used as a pawn in the power plays between the Ananzi and the Queen. (Also,  since his murderer, the Queen, was killed before my Ghost even knew that's who killed him, his only real revenge scene was his fruitless attack on the Queen's father because he knew just enough to know the Queen's father knew <i>something</i>.)<br/><br/>My Ghost was so focused on the troubles of those he cared about, when the NPC witch sacrificed herself at the end of season one to give him new life, it made sense to change his Skin to the Calaca for season two. Though I did consider keeping him as the Ghost because his personality is still so strongly, "Avoid thinking about upsetting things (though never move on from them)." <br/><br/>I think the nice thing about the Ghost's skin is that it's very versatile to the type of ghost story you want to tell. Revenge, confusion, denial, misdirected rage, lonely wandering, etc. I never felt that I was playing my Ghost "wrong" because there weren't really guardrails to stay between. Moving him over to the Calaca keeps bumping me up against, "But he's not really ready to let himself be happy because he knows he's a monster... But the Calaca's meant to be fairly cheerful, all-told. Is it 'okay' if my Calaca is more positive about there being things his friends can do to improve their own situations than his own life?" <br/><br/>The more restrictive-seeming a skin seems to be, the less interested I am in playing it. Especially with players who've seen the skin played before, because I'm more conscious of the idea that I'm retreading the same material. (I know that at one character-creation session one of my groups specifically asked for the Vampire not to get played because they'd seen it so often that they felt the skin was threadbare.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420345/#Comment_420345" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T07:27:30+00:00" title="August 19, 2013  7:27AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my Ghosts got murdered in hot passion too, but thought it was someone else than actually did the deed. It turned out she was collateral damage anyways. I made her focussed on revenge and starting in her incoporeal dark self. So she was just a creepy and obsessed influence in the beginning trying to ruin someones life. Having been an outsider before I mader her forget even about having a family (or the possibility to still reach them).<br/><br/>The other was murdered too but it had been 50 years ago and he was still hanging out at the high school, because there was nothing else to do and he was bored. His drive was to belong to the living again, live a life. He made contact with other characters after he saw things that reminded him of his time.
