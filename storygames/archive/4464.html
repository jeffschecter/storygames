These traits have nifty little mechanical bits...    And some of those bits introduce playstyle-altering stuff.  There's one (Dormant) where you can get game resources by having your dragon go to sleep while you act as an assistant to the GM.  Or another (Regnant) that changes you into a multiple-character player.<br/><br/>Now, in and of itself, that's not so odd.  But I want this to be, straight-out, something explicit - so that the GM or the group can decide in advance that *everyone* gets that trait effect, or decides to dump it from the game, or keep it as normal.  Effectively, modular chunks of playstlye as traits.<br/><br/>(It's not a really *new* thing.  Games do it more than is often noted - they just usually aren't very explicit or extensive about it)<br/><br/>So...     I want bits like that.  Things you've seen in games, bit of rules or methods of play, that you think are cool, and which might be able to be plugged in and out like that.<br/><br/>Got any?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100950/#Comment_100950" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T23:23:55+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 11:23PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Informant/Channeller] The character is used as a vehicle for the GM to deliver important information to players.<br/><br/>This one is usually the domain of knowledge characters, who can learn "vital clues" from the GM.

A variant is the Sixth Sense Guy, whose cryptic hints and "I have a bad feeling about this" lines turn out to be relevant in big ways for the same reasons. <br/><br/>The Romantic Heroine (or The Mary Sue): Similar to Mike's Inspiration, I got the idea for this one from a friend's preferred playstyle. For this character it's not a matter of what she (and it usually is a she) does, but who she is. The character might not ask for anything but the player actively works with the GM to have other characters, usually men, become inspired to great feats of nobility or prowess in her service. The character herself is always distressed and amazed at her benefactors' sacrifice, and angsts over it. A possible corollary is that some powerful and/or evil female(s) will hate and actively attempt to harm the character, not because she's done anything wrong but because... well, because. I'm not usually enamored of this playstyle, but the idea of actively gaming it is kind of intriguing. <br/><br/>The Overlord: The character is someone very powerful and influential in the game world. The character herself might not show up too often in game time, but will be the center of attention and flattery everytime she does show up. Rather than have frequent appearances, the player might work with the GM to shape gaming events or have another character handy to play. <br/><br/>In fact, all of these styles could have a kind of buyoff between screentime and plot/background control, since either way the player himself would have stuff to do and won't get bored (hopefully). The result would be that the character who shows up the most would also be the one with the least direct control of game events, resulting in someone who is often taken by surprise and has to rely the most on direct character action to influence events--with the attendant pain, danger, and drama. The character who shows up least would have the most in-game influence, but wouldn't really grow or change in important ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
