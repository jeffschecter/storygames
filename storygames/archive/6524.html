Certainly nothing new, which is one of the reasons I haven't really got anywhere with it, other than maybe some nice ideas about how goals and flaws factor into all of this.<br/><br/>One idea that occurred to me last night is to get away from the whole idea of applying "stats" to traits. Instead, let's just expand the traits to make them a bit more specific. If we have a character who is an incredibly skilled swordsman, he isn't "Swordsman (6d6)". Instead, he might be something like "Master swordsman trained by Obata Toshishiro" (or whatever). Each character is basically built out of a set of bullet points which describe their training, abilities, attributes, etc.<br/><br/>Now, when the player uses a trait to resolve a challenge, he describes his intent through the use of the trait. A master swordsman might describe himself attacking his opponents in a flurry of blows and parries, boldly taking on a bunch of mooks. A student would be more cautious, going on the defensive, looking for an opening. The player always uses a "foundational" trait (the core trait used for that action), and then can support that trait by including other traits in their description.<br/><br/>The GM then applies the following criteria to the player's description of their action:<br/><br/>1) Is the action supported by a foundational trait which is appropriate to the situation?<br/>2) Is the action appropriate to the character's ability level?<br/>3) Is the action colorfully described and interesting?<br/>4) Is the action used in a situation in which the character has tactical advantage?<br/>5) Is the action supported by more than one trait?<br/><br/>Basically, the player rolls a single d6 against a target number equal to the number of criteria which have been successfully met. They are looking to roll equal to or under this number for a success. With a success, they get to narrate the result of the action. Otherwise, the GM takes the narration.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Our master swordsman is attacked by a group of ninjas. The player describes the character's intent \u2026 he will use his skill with the blade to quickly slash at the first of the ninjas, following up with a reverse thrust against the one at his back. He will attack with quick, violent force, based on that character's "Merciless" trait.<br/><br/>The GM decides that the first criteria is met. The character has the right equipment (a sword), he is using using it in a traditionally deadly fashion, and he is making good use of his anti-ninja training. The second criteria is also met, since this character is a master swordsman and the ninja are beneath his abilities. The third criteria is also met, because the player did a good job describing his character's intent. For the fourth criteria, the GM decides that the character is outnumbered, and is at a fairly large disadvantage. The fifth criteria, however, is another positive for the player, since he described using a supporting trait.<br/><br/>The result, therefore, is 4 criteria met, which means the player needs to roll 4 or less on the 1d6. If he is successful he'll take the narration and describe the results of his action. Otherwise, the GM gets to decide what happened.<br/><br/>So, this is obviously not very grainy in terms of difficulty levels, modifiers, or defining the results of an action, but I think in general it would encourage fairly sold play which is true to the character. The player's will tend to propose and describe actions which reflect the character's abilities (in order to get the maximum chance for success). The system just ignores any complex situational rules and gives the GM and players the responsibility of defining what is reasonable on the fly. The GM is the final arbiter, but there might be a bit of negotiation as appropriate. I think (though I am not certain) that the use of the criteria as checkpoints serves to give the GM some structure and reduces hand-waviness.<br/><br/>The dice resolution doesn't quite scale right, but I'm sure with a bit of thought I can come up with something. I'm also considering adding in Fate/Luck/Goals or some other resource the player can choose to add to an action to give a better chance of success.<br/><br/>So \u2026 with a mature and cooperative group of players, is something like this reasonable? Is it too simplistic to generate fun? Am I overlooking some fundamental issues?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144623/#Comment_144623" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T00:37:56+00:00" title="May 17, 2008 12:37AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why the GM?<br/><br/>Imagine that you have a piece of paper in the middle of the table with five circles on it, labelled:<br/><br/>-One Trait<br/>-Two or More Traits<br/>-Good Description<br/>-Power Level Appropriate<br/>-Tactical Advantage<br/><br/>...And one die in each.<br/><br/>Anyone can reward the player these dice if they feel it is appropriate.

Here's what happens: everyone rolls the max number of dice every time. You know what you have to say to get all the dice, so that's what you say. No one ever just says one thing and rolls one die. Like, ever.<br/><br/>With your 5 levels, everyone is going to get 1, 2, 3, and 5 every time. It's a matter of creative description, which gamers are great at. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> will be open to some negotiation. So, in practice, almost all rolls will be 4 or less. No one will bother to consult the criteria list after about 10 minutes of play. They'll internalize it and do it every time, assuming a 4, unless they have a clear situational edge, then they get a 5.<br/><br/>In practice, this system has two difficulty levels for all tasks: 4 or less, and 5 or less. Is that enough to achieve your design goals for this system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144735/#Comment_144735" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-18T10:49:48+00:00" title="May 18, 2008 10:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if everyone "hits" on 4 or less most of the time, and 5 or less a good bit of the time, you'll likely have just enough danger to make things interesting, won't you?<br/><br/>Not really kidding, either. If that's how it works in practice, a lot will depend on how often rolls are called for. Further, with a flat distribution range, things will still be fairly dicey, even with a 5 in 6 chance of success.<br/><br/>Also, Shawn has sorta re-invented Matrix Game mechanics. Not a bad thing. It seems like a lot of folks stumble over that eventually.<br/><br/>One side hint, though; Those mechanics are all fine and good when the player ( or their character) is the active party against a GM character. They don't necessarily work as well if the Ninjas from the example are active, or if two players come into conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
