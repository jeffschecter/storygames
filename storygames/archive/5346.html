I felt excited to see all the interesting stuff coming out soon, but also a little intimidated.  My zest for learning new game systems has faded considerably, and there's more and more demand for the clear-headed reading time that it takes to read and understand new systems.  <br/><br/>At the same time, it seems to be that there are more <i>good</i> open license gaming systems out there than ever before.  But, aside from systems with "20" in the name, I don't really see a flood of new interesting stuff that takes those engines and does cool new things with them.  <br/><br/>Instead, I see a lot of different designers tinkering with innovative mechanics to create all-new games with new systems.  And that's a good thing too, but I wonder at the balance, and I wonder what accounts for it?  Do the game designers want to do things that can't be done with the available tools?  Are a lot of the new games with old systems I mentioned remaining "game hacks" and houserules, and never being put forward as games in their own right?  <br/><br/>And at what point does a set of rules go from being a "house campaign" to being an actual <i>thing</i>?    The only example that comes to mind right now is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dictionary of Mu </span>-- it evolved from Judd's cool one-sheet and Sorcerer campaign to become a book.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120190/#Comment_120190" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T14:41:02+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  2:41PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite> Are a lot of the new games with old systems I mentioned remaining "game hacks" and houserules, and never being put forward as games in their own right?</blockquote>\nThe work necessary to make that jump, from fun document that I reference with friends, to product that I will publish, put money into and sell for ca$h is pretty intense.<br/><br/>I'm not saying people can't do it; I'm just saying part of the reason you might not be seeing lots of home campaigns making that leap is because of that chasm of work to be done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120308/#Comment_120308" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T03:22:52+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  3:22AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a lot of people designing mechanics is fun, so much fun that they are willing to think up a game to go with their mechanic (and sometimes then claim they thought up the mechanic to go with the game I suspect) just to get to use it.

Not fine setting, not fine rules nor nice fellow players. (Good night's sleep before gaming is useful, though.)<br/><br/>I'm working on a game, but in fact using any of those systems never even occured to me. <br/><br/>- WuShu is a the Illusionist's best friend. It also commits the WuShu Crime. (Uses the Trait Pattern with numbers attached and NOT as a ressource. Clever Players will be inclined to take a very broad stept at 5 and use it all the time.) <br/><br/>- True20? I'm among the few who like Blue Rose. But I surely didn't want to make a D20 game.<br/><br/>- SotC is a FATE hack. Fate is fine. It told me about the pyramid - the only viable solution to prevent one trick ponies except for a cap on skill levels. I borrowed that for my game. (FATE also uses Traits, not commiting the WuShu Crime.)<br/><br/>- From TSoY I borrowed Pool and Pool Refreshment. I didn't care about the BdtP. I wanted a more traditional apprach to conflicts. I also wanted a game without crunch and without keys. Why use TSoY?<br/><br/><br/>I did use a preexisting system, though. Donjon. Only by now it's not recognizeable at all. Other dice, totally different types of stats etc. You can roll for narration and bonus dice, but that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120552/#Comment_120552" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T02:04:43+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  2:04AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>OK, that makes sense.

I'm don't concentrate on setting material for them, but on particular modifications I enjoy (though Budo does have a default setting).<br/><br/>As far as settings and stories go I figure there are plenty of them around.

Also, indie games have their heartbreakers just like everything else.  Sometimes, new indie games are simply a rules-lite system with a few interesting mechanics that are aimed specifically at the game's goals.  In the best cases, every rule is carefully thought out and integrated into the core concept, but that's not always the case.  So, yeah, sometimes it might be true that the couple of interesting mechanics could just as easily (or more easily, even) be written up as a supplement for some other game, but, oh well, indie publishing is about doing what you want to do with your ideas.<br/><br/>I've got projects on the burner based on Blue Rose/True20/OGL material, Shock:, In a Wicked Age, and Cold City.  Honestly, I hope this kind of thing becomes more common, since creating supplements provides a great entry into indie game publishing, but I don't think it's all that surprising that people growing up with dreams of releasing their own RPG go straight for creating a new, independent game.  That's not only the dream, that's the model that's been demonstrated by the Forge Booth (with a couple notable exceptions like Mu) and IPR.  If it's changing at all, it's going to be a gradual process, perhaps a response to the flood of new games, such that it's easier to get attention with a supplement to a game people already like, own, and play semi-regularly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120571/#Comment_120571" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T06:44:26+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  6:44AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm making Van Dread on a hacked Fate version.

You wouldn't take the car in your driveway to go compete in a NASCAR event, after all.  Fate might make it fairly easy to come up with new components of your own and graft them on in a way that makes them function as an extension of Fate's idiom (much as you could refit the car in your driveway to make it at least a bit more of a dragster), but there's some stuff you simply can't do without doing something entirely new: Don't Rest Your Head couldn't be done with Fate, period, full stop.

One of the things that really grab me about certain indie games is the way that the mechanics evoke the themes or setting of the game-- when everything feels thematically coherent, the game experience is amazing. It's difficult to achieve that kind of coherency when you're not designing from the ground up, UNLESS your concept is specifically "Hey, I'd love to make a supplement for game X."<br/><br/>That said, hacking games is big fun!

Vincent just happened to have answered the same question I'd been asking for a long time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121728/#Comment_121728" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T12:52:11+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 12:52PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [plug name="GLASS" humility="low"]Well, I am making a (mostly) open system for boffer/Airsoft/paintball/(martial arts) LARPs, which I sincerely hope will be blessed with supplements. I am doing so because I haven't see a LARP system yet that's truly generic and modular/flexible: a market void, I believe (though I also really doubt the LARP community is ready for such a thing--LOTS of Not Invented Here issues with many LARP groups).[/plug]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121731/#Comment_121731" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T12:58:44+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 12:58PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the responses.
