It comes from an idea I had for a roleplaying game which uses the text of Machiavelli's The Prince as the basis for a game. Paul Czege toyed with it, but it never got any further.<br/><br/><b>Summary</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Round</span><br/>Contestants should submit a new roleplaying game which is based on an out-of-copyright document. The game, at this stage, must include no more than 5000 words, excluding the document on which it's based.<br/><br/>All submissions must be anonymous.<br/><br/>All submissions must have been playtested by the designer, changed as a result, and playtested at least once more.<br/><br/>All designers must agree to playtest another randomly selected game from the contestants and submit a playtest report to the designer. Entrants are welcome to playtest any other entry of their choice and submit reports.<br/><br/>I'll also solicit playtest feedback from other non-contestants, however, only the one playtest response from another designer is necessary to continue to the next round.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Round</span><br/>Contestants edit and resubmit their documents based on the playtest feedback. The word restriction is lifted. I might add an art/layout contest at this stage.<br/><br/>If necessary, I will whittle the entrants down to three somehow. Help with this stage, please!<br/><br/>At this point, I'll arrange for all three entries to be playtested by outside playtesters who have no contact with the game other than your text. Each group will test all three games.<br/><br/>I will playtest all three entries, too.<br/><br/>A Golden Satsuma winner will emerge as a result of the feedback, as will the Silver and Bronze Satsumas, unless none make the cut. I don't know whether to allow some additional changes based on the feedback first. Help with this stage, please!<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Prize</span><br/>The prize will be good, do not worry. It will be either cash up front, on publication, or ongoing publishing bills paid. I'd like to see the game published commercially, but that's up to the designer. I don't care what the publication or ownership model is.<br/><br/><b>Details</b><br/>This is not a layout contest, but the text should be clean and accessible.<br/><br/>All in English, people.<br/><br/>The base document must available for download and listed as out of copyright at either <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gutenberg.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/texts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.archive.org/details/texts</a><br/>There must be no restrictions on republication of these texts, even if you would be happy to release it with such strictures. For example, on archive.org, it would be listed as NOT_IN_COPYRIGHT. The title, if you are using it for the title of your game, must not be a trademark for games in the US. If you choose not to use the title, then this is not an issue. No Lovecraftian or Mythos entries.<br/><br/>By "based on" I mean that the setting or system of the roleplaying game is based on, or depends on, the document.<br/><br/>By anonymous, I mean make all reasonable efforts to disguise your indentity, and keep it hidden throughout the process.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300415/#Comment_300415" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T10:16:38+00:00" title="November 11, 2010 10:16AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds good and productive.

Quite simply put, I can't even find enough people to play a game of Dresden Files. Role-players in my area are notoriously shy of anything outside of the mainstream, and here I'd have to get them to do it at least twice? If I also ask them to submit written playtest reports... In short, I wouldn't be able to do it.<br/><br/>Other things that concern me: I would be worried about picking a document that other people had already declared an interest in writing a game for. More than one game based on the same document would have less impact due to perceived similarities and direct competition from other games, rather than being able to stand on its own merits. This is especially the case in an anonymous contest since the contestants can't discuss how they're going to treat the source document and arrange to do things differently. I'd personally like to see some kind of 'lock out' where entrants have to register their interest in a given text, then nobody else can pick the same one. A bit fiddly to organise I know, but I think it would be fairer to everyone in the long run.<br/><br/>All this being equal, I think it's a pretty good idea. I hope enough time will be made in the first section for people to thoroughly read their source material though.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300506/#Comment_300506" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T02:13:42+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  2:13AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jason">@Jason</a> Thanks, Jason.

You might get more, since you'll advertise it more widely.<br/><br/>Reading this number of games critically is a massive undertaking. We tend to like games under 5 pages (say, 2000 words). Anything else becomes a <i>massive</i> chore to read through.<br/><br/>(Let's say you get 20 entries. If each is 5000 words, that's 100000 words to read. Now imagine you get 50 or 100, either of which is quite possible.)\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a> I mean, the judges will take into account playtest feedback when they decide on the winner.

I'm much more interested in the judges' subjective opinions than those of playtest groups.<br/><br/>As for waiting for the game to be edited again, I don't mind, really.

Your entrants won't just be indie designers. They'll be, at least partly, from the Cthulhu side. And the tradition there, rather than writing short games, is to write pages of scenario description, fiction, skill lists and so forth. If you set the word limit too low, you stop people writing games with skill lists. From that point of view, I think you should keep the word limit high (5000 rather than 3000).<br/><br/>2. That said, word limits also focus people's writing. They stop you from writing pages of wanky fan-fiction, since you need to use the word limit for the mechanics. <br/><br/>Either 3000 or 5000 sounds good to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300513/#Comment_300513" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T04:26:59+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  4:26AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every time I've sponsored a contest I have lowered the available word count, and the effects seem positive overall.

When I'm moving really quickly and have short games of about 5 pages, I can do about 2 in an hour.  Longer games or games that need more comments (either because they need more praise or need more work) take closer to an hour each.<br/><br/>Also, there's really no way of verifying how much playtesting has occurred, especially with anonymous submissions, though you can often tell if a game has not been playtested with a close reading. Three rounds of playtesting (two of your game, one of someone else's), makes it sound like this contest will take 6 months, and honestly, I'm not sure if you want a contest to dominate your life for that long.<br/><br/>One of the things I want to be able to leave Game Chef with is a judging/playtesting system that is actually feasible for one or two people to manage and happens in a relatively short amount of time.  We've never had that, period, and it's really hurting the contest in the long run.  The playoffs this year are a step forward, but I don't think they're a real solution.  It's honestly much easier to compare games against each other and decide which one is better, so next year I'm thinking the playoffs might have a bracket structure like an actual sports tournament.  And, then, you can assign people to read or play two different games and decide on a winner in their stage of the bracket, before passing that on to the next round.  That way, you distribute the work, and the better games get read, commented, and/or played more without having to count <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23s&amp;Mode=like">#s</a> of playtests or whatever.  The real trouble in such a system is the seeding of games, but that could be completely random or based on seniority or something.<br/><br/>In any event, the good thing about crowdsourcing is you have to do less work.  The bad thing is inconsistent quality of judging / feedback etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300546/#Comment_300546" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T09:03:56+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  9:03AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Maybe the reading is also parceled out among judges, who choose a favorite from among their allotted entries.

I liked this for breaking away from pure judge subjectivity (although I'm biased being in the winning group). <br/><br/>I've judged a few design (web / graphic / interface) contests and often it came down to gaming the Judges' tastes. I try to judge outside my personal interests but it's difficult. And often the designs that win competitions aren't the designs that would do well in the wild where customers decide. It's easier to impress the 1% mega gamers than the general RPG audience.<br/><br/>But Jared's method rewarded designers with marketing skills not people purely focused on game design (which was on purpose since it emulated reality, at least on an indie level). The playtesting requirement rewards people with organization &amp; networking skills. If layout is a factor, you reward those skills. Tight deadlines reward people with more free time. No matter what it won't be purely about game design and you won't please everyone. It becomes a question of what skill sets you want to reward. <br/><br/>In a pure "judge decides based on what they personally like" situation, it can help to diversify the judges. Maybe someone who loves traditional games, someone else who loves story games, a game store owner. If you diversify the judges you take away "gaming the judges" and subjectivity becomes a contest feature.<br/><br/>What criteria do you want the judges to use? What's more important to you? Which games best make use of their source material? Innovation? Marketability? Personally I think innovation is overrated and would rather reward games that solve problems.<br/><br/>Whatever the criteria, if there is a scoring component, I've found having categories limited to 2-3 possible ratings "bad, good, great" eliminates judges interpreting ratings differently. Even "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" is better than 0-10 ratings. <br/><br/>In terms of weeding out contestants, I'm a fan of a funnel approach where requirements becomes stricter as you proceed so people effectively filter themselves out. Which is why playtesting requirements could work well. We may not be able to prove playtesting but listing playtester names and trust mostly takes care of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300616/#Comment_300616" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T13:34:48+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  1:34PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @Destriarch On the basis that this contest requires the entrant both to playtest their own game, and one other entrants, then yes, designers either not willing or able to attend games conventions, find a group online, or locally will not be able to submit an entry.<br/>\n<br/>\n@J Walton - We certainly aren't trying not to be helpful!

If I'm handed a random game that I can't get excited about I don't think my playtesting feedback would be of any use.  If the game doesn't excite me then I'm not the game's target audience and therefore it's worthless to solicit my feedback on it.<br/><br/>Allowing the entrants to choose a game off the list (maybe without looking at the mechanics, just the high concept?) would insure that games get matched with people for whom the game's subject matter has relevance.  That runs the risk of having games that don't get chosen but having your game not chosen might be a kind of useful feedback itself.

Then we deal with any duplicates.<br/>\nThen, they submit their short blurb, say a week later.<br/>\nThen, two months later we get the first drafts, playtested once.<br/>\nI think a month for the first round (designers) of playtesting, a rewrite, then two months for the general playtest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy a document, I mean something primarily or exclusively text. A contest based on images would also be of interest, but not this one.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Jesse Entering the game means commiting to a playtest. I'm not sure how to ensure that both people get to test the game they want and also ensure all games are tested. I quite like your blurb idea, but I', reluctant to have untested games.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Destriach If you can't find local players, won't or can't test online, and won't or can't go to conventions, then this is not the contest for you. The reason for designer playtesting is that before the text is polished up enough to transmit the actual play you want, I think you have to test if the mechanics of the game actually work, through play. There are already lots of contests for untested games. This is a contest which features designers responding to playtest feedback both directly and through reports of actual play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's becoming clear to me I will need someone who can deal with the anonymity aspect, other than me, unless I want to recuse myself from decision making.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300827/#Comment_300827" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T05:14:07+00:00" title="November 15, 2010  5:14AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2010 5:19AM by Destriarch.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, sorry to belabour the point, I didn't want people thinking that I was just being cussed or awkward for no reason.

As a contest judge I'd love a way to filter out people who will take up a lot of bandwidth and then fail to turn in a game.

It just seems like an idea that is more bad than good, but that's probably because I'm invested in doing things a certain way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301106/#Comment_301106" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T05:25:07+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  5:25AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, that man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301118/#Comment_301118" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T06:44:05+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  6:44AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2010 6:46AM by Destriarch.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It's a natural filter.

It's also an established method for paid competitions that entries are accompanied by fees when they are submitted, not when you're just thinking about it. But hey, I won't be entering anyway, so what's it matter? And to be absolutely fair, this is all just opinion; nobody is universally right or wrong, it depends entirely on intent. And as far as filters go, charging any kind of fee should be filter enough, regardless of when it should be paid.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
