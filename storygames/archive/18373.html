A Pay-by-Forum on RPGGeek seems a likely place to try it out.<br/><br/>However, a game etiquette question immediately came to mind that I need to figure out before I proceed. Do does not have a gamemaster in the traditional D&amp;D sense. But theoretically someone has to choose the letter to get things going. Who does that?<br/><br/>And what is the etiquette is someone wants to write and use an <i>original</i> letter, something nobody else will have read yet?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414107/#Comment_414107" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T04:30:54+00:00" title="May 15, 2013  4:30AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The book leaves it up to each group to decide.  When I facilitate Do, I'm usually presenting the game to some players new to playing do.  So I use the same sort of protocol I use for helping a Fiasco group pick a playset: choose 3-5 letters that I'm excited about playing and give a brief description of each.  If any one grabs a player's attention, then that player can read the letter in depth.  Eventually, we find a letter people are happy to play.<br/><br/>If we have new players, then we always play through the Melanie and the whales letter first.  It's a training adventure, good to help people get used to the system.<br/><br/>If I was running via forum, I'd want to use Melanie and the whales first.  If people still want to play more after that letter, you can present them with ~3 letters to choose from (find letters online and link to them, perhaps).<br/><br/><br/>For letters of your own writing: present your original letter at the start.  Let the players know that you wrote it, so that can inform their decision.  For play by forum, you could probably use that as the starting point of the discussion: "Come play this new adventure I wrote for Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple".  <br/><br/>Most important when playing your own letter, though, is this:  You have absolute power over the characters and letter when you write it.  But once you're playing the game, you're another pilgrim, just like anyone else.  You don't have any more authority over the NPCs or the world than any other player at the table.  (If you do see something that isn't working the way you wanted it to, note it down and revise the letter for next time.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael_Hopcroft" title="Michael_Hopcroft"><img alt="Michael_Hopcroft" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael_Hopcroft">Michael_Hopcroft</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414203/#Comment_414203" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T19:11:05+00:00" title="May 16, 2013  7:11PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've written my first letter now.

I don't think he got the reference, but that's fine since that means it stands on its own as a decent letter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414209/#Comment_414209" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T22:37:54+00:00" title="May 16, 2013 10:37PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Do forum isn't exactly very active these days -- the last post is from 2009.

Let me know what you think.<br/><br/><i>Dear Pilgrims of the Flying Temple:<br/><br/>Is it possible to be too loved?<br/><br/>A while ago I was helping my grandfather at the mountain shrine he\u2019s been running seemingly forever. There was a forbidden cave on the shrine grounds that had been kept under lock and key for hundreds of years. So naturally I got curious about it and snuck in there. That changed my life forever.<br/><br/>Turns out there was a genuine demon in the cave, who\u2019d been sleeping all this time, and I woke her up. I got out of that cave as fast as my legs could carry me, but a few weeks later she tracked me down to my school and started chasing me around the grounds blowing up stuff. Only by then the demon didn\u2019t look skeletal anymore \u2013 it looked like a pretty girl who, after the school exploded, followed me home.<br/><br/>But that wasn\u2019t the only surprise. Hunting the demon was a magic princess and her little sister. The princess and the demon had a big fight, and soon the house was no more. I had to go back to the shrine, and they followed me. Sure enough, when we got there a lady cop from space was waiting for us, looking for a really big bad guy.<br/><br/>Did I mention they all have superpowers?<br/><br/>Things have settled down a little bit. Everybody (demon included) now lives in the house at the shrine. We maintain it and I\u2019ve taken up carrot farming. But there\u2019s a big problem \u2013 all the girls have fallen hopelessly in love with me and the three older ones are continually fighting over me. (The little girl doesn't join in, which is fortunate because the alternative would be really creepy.) I constantly have to fix the damage they cause. Now I don\u2019t object to any of them being here \u2013 at least not anymore \u2013 but if I choose one the reaction of the others would be too terrifying to contemplate, and a day doesn't go by when they don\u2019t ask me to choose.<br/><br/>I can\u2019t send them all away, because every so often some really bad people show up and the girls need to combine their powers to fight them off. Someone seems to think I\u2019m really special and that\u2019s why I attract all this attention. But really, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just an ordinary guy.<br/><br/>I\u2019m going to tie this message around the collar of this large rabbit that\u2019s been following me around.</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414248/#Comment_414248" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-17T10:29:58+00:00" title="May 17, 2013 10:29AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, harem anime!
