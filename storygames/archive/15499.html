Big or Small, but Notable For You. What are some milestones in your gaming life from 2011?<br/><br/>Most of mine are play-oriented, including:<br/><br/>* The completion of a long-running multi-generation <b>HELLAS</b> campaign. Elias the Amazoran Whoremaster was retired by choice and not by dagger!<br/><br/>* Getting a chance to play Freemarket.<br/><br/>* Just swimming in gaming: Visits to area tables, my bi-weekly game, a weird demigroup that formed and ended up playing pretty much weekly for months, etc. It's been a bountiful year.<br/><br/>* Going to GPNW and meeting new friends (Logan B, etc), seeing online friends in person for the first time (Christian Griffen, Mike Sugarbaker, Ben Robbins, Chris Eng, Adam Koebel and more) hanging out with other good friends like The Harps', Eric Boyd, Derek Guder, Tony Dowler and more). And playing a ton of fun stuff, from Norwegian to a "Lemony Snicket RPG" playtest to action-y stuff.<br/><br/>* Supporting about a dozen cool RPG Kickstarters, most of which manifested. Of particular note was the Hellas action deck (reminiscent of the TORG action deck) and companion vinyl play-mat, Dave Hill's game of immortal love Amaranthine among others. There's been a lot of creativity exposed due to Kickstarter.<br/><br/>* Camp Nerdly (I got to play, too, and not just oversee! I tend to spend a lot of time making sure that others are having fun even at the expense of my own gaming sessions), and meeting Zac F2F there as well.<br/><br/>* Going from "wanting to maybe sometime play this cool-looking Japanese RPG about ninjas" to "playing/running 10+ sessions of it in just a few months.<br/><br/>* Seeing lots of cool new S-G threads that helped me step up my game at the table. <br/><br/>The Design/Production/Blah stuff includes:<br/><br/>* Making huge gains in closing in on a Tenra Bansho Zero release<br/>* Getting involved in a few more Japanese RPG projects<br/><br/>Problemy stuff:<br/>* Heavy work, promotion, critical work stuff plus the aforementioned flood of awesome gaming pretty much sidelined a few small RPG projects I was working on. Too Much Life, had to jettison some gaming.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351452/#Comment_351452" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T10:21:15+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 10:21AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2011 10:30AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, good idea!<br/><br/>Play stuff:<br/>- Continuing to play in two long running Burning Wheel campaigns with people that I like a lot.<br/>- Running a Google Hangouts based Glorantha game.<br/>- All the gaming I did at Burning Apocalypse con.<br/>- Getting invited over to jenskot and pterrysaur's place to play some Kagematsu.<br/>- Playing some cool one-on-one games with Carly including Apocalypse World and Annalise.<br/>- Quitting my awful 60-70 hour a week hell job and finally being able to game again!<br/><br/>Design stuff:<br/>- Finishing The Final Girl!

It was my first GenCon, I got to meet a bunch of people in person who'd previously been only Internet entities and/or voices on Skype calls, FATE Kerberos came out (signing books! my name on a poster!)... it was exhausting and a lot of fun. As soon as it was done, I was like, "Son of a bitch! Now I have to go to <i>this</i> every year."<br/><br/>Design stuff:<br/>FATE Kerberos -- a ton of work and a big accomplishment, plus it's led to some really awesome follow-up projects.<br/>Globe Records, my Game Chef entry. It's not a big game, but I'm happy with it -- and getting it done during Comic-Con weekend impressed even me.<br/>By The Gods!, the S&amp;S game I've been working on. After a rough playtest in September, I had some breakthroughs that have made it a much better game.<br/><br/>Discoveries:<br/>Dungeon World. It looks very likely I'll be doing nothing at OrcCon but playing and running it. And I'm totally cool with that.<br/>Ascension. So late to the party!<br/>DungeonMorph Dice. Very cool, and an unfortunate distraction from more pressing matters. Can't wait to use them for Dangers &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>Purchases:<br/>Lots of old stuff -- Space Opera, Swordbearer, MERP 2nd ed., old Judges' Guild supplements for D&amp;D, etc. I'm a sucker for that stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351466/#Comment_351466" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T11:49:11+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 11:49AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Writing Marvel.<br/><br/>Playing Apocalypse World with Hindmarch at Origins.<br/><br/>Many smaller yet fun things game-related that keep me inspired.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Cam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351469/#Comment_351469" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T12:10:36+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 12:10PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - Got things moving on publishing Golden Sky Stories.<br/> - Got a good start on Magical Burst and watched it acquire a fanbase<br/> - Likewise started working on and had a really fun 3-session playtest of Dragon World<br/> - Played in a really kickass campaign that started in the Smallville RPG and finished in Primetime Adventures.

My friends adore her and she has fit seemlessly into the game group. My ex-wife tolerated my gaming, but never liked it. My gf actively encourages me and wants to learn. Huge shift in dynamics for me, and its resulted in more and better gaming. Plus she is all around awesome.<br/><br/>Other events:<br/><br/>Origins: Went with my gf and got to show her a gaming convention. We had a lot of fun shopping and trying some game demos.<br/><br/>CharCon: October gaming convention in Charleston WV. Went with the gf and her daughter, met up with a bunch of friends, had a great weekend.<br/><br/>In general, having not one but two semi-regular gaming groups and getting to break out games like Gamma World which i haven't been able to work in before. Not a lot of story gaming with this group, but I'm already making plans to introduce a couple of one-shot games using different systems, and so far people are receptive.<br/><br/>I predict 2012 will be a great gaming year for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid" title="SavageHominid"><img alt="SavageHominid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid">SavageHominid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351476/#Comment_351476" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T12:32:59+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 12:32PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Biggest thing! <br/><br/>Moving to PDX, and meeting awesome people at the various GoPlay meetups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/asurber" title="asurber"><img alt="asurber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/asurber">asurber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351477/#Comment_351477" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T12:37:05+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 12:37PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Designing:<br/>Good start design a system for dramatic Anime.<br/><br/>Played:\n<ol>\n<li>Don't Rest Your head -- An eye opening experience to a system that drives that game and the players to take risks.</li>\n<li>Apocalypse World -- Helped codify a style of GMing I have been trying to achieve</li>\n<li>Spirit of the Century -- Loved the system, but does not match my GMing Style</li>\n<li>D&amp;D 4th ed. -- Much to like -- but does not match my desires as a player</li>\n<li>Mutant and Masterminds -- made me realize there are good d20 systems</li>\n<li>Solar system  -- My favorite generic system</li>\n<li>Risus -- Always enjoyable for a short game</li>\n<li>Dark Heresy --an enjoyable old school style game </li>\n</ol>\nPurchased:\n<ul>\n<li>Becoming Heroes</li>\n<li>Mutant and Masterminds</li>\n<li>Trail of Cthulu</li>\n<li>Shock</li>\n<li>FreeMarket</li>\n<li>TechNior -- really like the adjective system</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351480/#Comment_351480" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T12:58:50+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 12:58PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This year was an explosion of goodness - role-playing the way I always thought it should be, and a lot of it.<br/><br/>* apocalypse world, both a game that's gone over a year over skype and Walton's Apocalyse-World-In-Space.<br/>* fabricated realities!

(Unfortunately this high point was followed by some sessions that nearly blew up the group due to some incompatible assumptions about how we were supposed to play, and I feel like some of that tension still isn't completely resolved).<br/><br/>- Took over GMing for my group's DFRPG game. After seeing it from the GM's perspective I realized that the game's design was disappointingly thin and handwavey. I was happy that the scenario I put together resonated well with our characters and setting, though.<br/><br/>- Was actually able to design an appopriately contest-length game for a design contest, <i>Brick &amp; Mortar: Last of the Independents</i>, for the April Ronnies.<br/><br/>- I wrote a series of blog posts I'm pretty proud of that mapped concepts I read in Robert B. Cialidini's <i>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</i> to some effective design techniques in RPGs.<br/><br/>- I got interviewed on the New Style podcast.<br/><br/>- Ran a series of playtests of JB Mannon's game <i>Boarsdraft</i>, which is essentially Harry Potter with the serial numbers filed off. I'm a big Harry Potter fan, but the idea of Harry Potter gaming had never really excited me before. The creative constraint of making things almost-but-not-quite Harry Potter really sparked my imagination, though, and led to some stuff that I really enjoyed. The playtest also seemed useful to Josh in highlighting some issues he needed to address in the game.<br/><br/>- Put out a bunch of episodes of my AP podcast <i>Designer vs. Reality</i>. I think I've gotten pretty good at editing podcasts now, but the show isn't generating the kinds of conversations I had hoped for, so I'm not sure whether I'll continue with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351501/#Comment_351501" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T14:36:23+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  2:36PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I finally did it. I finally participated in a long campaign game. After almost 30 years of being into roleplaying, I've finally run a game that lasted longer than a handful of sessions. I've been playing a game with my wife, son, and a few friends approximately every other Wednesday since last November or so. And even though we're probably going to abandon it without a big finish and switch to the half-roleplay-half-boardgame Battlestations soon (cause my son is getting it for Xmas and I predict that he's going to be super excited and want to switch games) I still consider the year to have been a great learning experience.<br/><br/>Also spent half the year attending a monthly sci fi larp with my wife and son, called Starship Valkyrie, which has been a blast. Seeing my 9 year old son totally rock the engineering procedures, which are the most complicated part of the game other than the people management of the bridge, has been awesome.<br/><br/>And I took my son to gaming conventions for the first time this year, and he was awesome there as well. He learned to play the Bang card game and totally loves it, though we don't often have enough people around for a good game. And we played a superspy game based on the old Jem cartoon that was an absolute blast and that he still occasionally mentions months later.<br/><br/>I went to the WyrdCon LARP convention and had a really good time. I'm planning to run a live-action TriWizard Tournament event next year, which should be pretty awesome.<br/><br/>It's been a good year for gaming, and next year holds promise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gravity" title="gravity"><img alt="gravity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gravity">gravity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351502/#Comment_351502" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T14:39:50+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  2:39PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A very interesting year. Wanted to game more, but quality has been great. <br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>\u2022 Ran an awesome campaign of Apocalypse World<br/>\u2022 Played in a thrilling campaign of Burning Empires that almost teared the group apart, led to loads of fruitful discussions and now we are agreeing to disagreeing on whether or not the game is great (we are by tradition a bunch of scandinavian freeformers).<br/>\u2022 Played Fiasco around 10 times and had a blast each time. Wonderful how such a light, open-ended system can create such consistent goodness. Many times with people who'd never played RPGs before, and they loved it too. <br/>\u2022 Playtested a campaign of the neat new Swedish indie RPG "Svavelvinter" with the designer and enjoyed the process. <br/>\u2022 Finally got to play My Life with Master and it was so intense and good. Could bring this to a desert island (with a few likeminded people) and not really miss civilisation. <br/>\u2022 Have managed to get my girlfriend to play card &amp; boardgames. Eased her in with San Juan and now we game all kinds of stuff on a regular basis. <br/>\u2022 After a ling hiatus, have gotten into boardgames again big time, and introduced loads of non-gamers to modern euro games. With a few exceptions they love it, want to play as soon as we meet up, and are now getting board games to their friends &amp; fam for Christmas. <br/><br/>Starting my own business have meant much less gaming than is healthy, but am hoping to start a weekly game night next year. 2012 will be better, stronger, faster!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351513/#Comment_351513" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T17:09:32+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  5:09PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2011 5:14PM by zircher.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got 'seriously' into indie games and supporting charities and authors with my money.

These days I'm running two 7th Sea games (one about a crew of pirates all tormented by terrible pasts and another about a team of the Explorer's Society trying to learn about things that Man Was Not Meant To Know), and a Delta Green game alternated with a Classic campaign (Shadows of Yog-Sothoth) that provides terrible insights to the players about things to come in the DG game. Probably one of the 7th Sea games and the CoC will go on hiatus for a few weeks due to Christmas.<br/><br/>Last weekend we tested Cthulhu Dark and it was fucking awesome. I used the Thomas Fell scenerio from Trail of Cthulhu, and Cthulhu Dark gave us a wonderful experience. Excellent lovecraftian advice, and a great pic-up game. We will be playing it more in the near future.<br/><br/>No designs, I'm not so much into designing, but a short mini-campaign of mine will be published along with the GM screen of Aquelarre, an Spanish RPG based on Middle Age floklore, which is a game I love madly.

It was so good to scratch my experimental itch with a supportive group of like-minded folks.<br/><br/>* Playing the crap out of <i>Apocalypse World</i>, over something like 30+ sessions.  Haven't played a single game that much since high school.  I feel like I learned more about playing and designing RPGs from that experience than I have from several years of online conversations.<br/><br/>* Game Chef 2011 and Stage One were both amazing this year and have made me really excited about design contests and helping out upcoming designers over the next few years. The plans for Game Chef 2012 are already ridiculous-awesome.<br/><br/>* Being invited to talk about games at PAX Dev and this "Gamification of Healthcare" event.  The actual panels were merely okay, but it hints at bigger stuff to come, maybe.<br/><br/>* Getting to see old friends and new faces at PAX, Go Play, and other times when folks wander through Seattle. The indie community is really about the face-to-face stuff between people and it was really great this year, though I still missed seeing some folks.<br/><br/>* Generally I feel like I'm steadily making progress and getting to an even better place about my relationship to the hobby and publishing and the time I spend talking about games online.  It doesn't stress me out or embarrass me nearly as much as it used to, which allows me to fully enjoy it.<br/><br/><b>Problems</b><br/><br/>* I haven't made as much progress on the <i>Magic Missile</i> anthology project as I'd like, and I hate feeling guilty and indebted to people for stuff that I haven't found the time to do.  Everyone I've talked to about it has been great and folks like Brennan and Luke have graciously offered to help, so I have confidence we can get this done, but, man, I hate feeling like I've let people down.  Trying to push past that and making positive yardage.<br/><br/>* In general, my job has been great, but it's also made life really busy, especially lately, so I don't have more than a single day a week to think and write anything about games -- and often that's taken up playing games!  I even have the last 6 reviews from Stage One still to post, which is pretty unacceptable (today, I hope!).  So that'll be a factor going forward, since there's so much I want to be able to do, but limited time to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351569/#Comment_351569" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T08:38:28+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  8:38AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The highlights for me were <br/><br/>* Playing a lot with my local friends, who I love.

The sheer openness and immediate questions that the game presents totally transformed my ideas about what games can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I ran Lacuna, Part 1 at Oakland Endgame and Big Bad, and was seriously impressed by its power as an engine of paranoia and thrill.

Fortunately, none of these happened at Camp Nerdly! It was amazing. <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i>, <i>Kagematsu</i>, and a 60s Manson Family version of<i> My Life With Master</i>... all a blast. <br/>Our attempt at a Dwarf Fortress-themed <i>Polaris</i> was fun, but I need to do more work on it before it can shine.<br/><br/>I've also been involved in a pretty badass <i>Apocalypse World</i> campaign for the past couple of months - 2 players who've pretty much never RPed before, plus a veteran of "trad games", joined me as MC. We just added a fourth player who has never played an RPG before. It's definitely a good introductory game, and it's been going really well! <br/><br/>Lastly, I been working off and on on a Lord of the Rings game, but the AW game is taking precedence (and frankly, I almost always work on game designs when I haven't been able to play enough in a while... it's like a surrogate for the actual activity.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351732/#Comment_351732" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T18:02:01+00:00" title="December 16, 2011  6:02PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a newborn at home this year, so my gaming opportunities became few and far in-between.

Watching Brendan Adkins create Danger Patrol "Gamma" on the fly and run an awesome session.

I ran a slam-dunk game of Dungeon World for four bored players waiting for their next session to start. After an hour and 15 minutes, every player walked away with a smile on their face, asking where they could get the game!<br/><br/>-A Day of Fiasco in North Carolina.

This is very much a <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23firstworldproblem&amp;Mode=like">#firstworldproblem</a>, but it's made it very difficult for me to start a fresh, big campaign using my favorite game (BW). I ran a 6p BW this year and it was fulfilling but no way in hell could I run that into the indefinite future. This is actually what prompted me to build my Mouse Guard sci-fi game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ" title="DaveyJJ"><img alt="DaveyJJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ">DaveyJJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351867/#Comment_351867" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-18T18:35:16+00:00" title="December 18, 2011  6:35PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2011 6:35PM by DaveyJJ.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mine list is very simple, actually: <br/>\n<br/>\n* Joining Story Games forums and discovering a lot of great conversation and ideas. <br/>\n* Finding Ben Robbin's brilliant Microscope with help from forum members here. <br/>\n* Playing several great sessions of A Taste for Murder. <br/>\n* Realizing I liked RPGs again after many many years away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351917/#Comment_351917" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T10:06:54+00:00" title="December 19, 2011 10:06AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            playing: helping playtest smallville, atlantis rising, and void vultures<br/>designing: returning to heads of state after several years &amp; launching kickstarter for it; trying my 'nothing exists til you name it' civ style story game<br/>community: 6th year of fairly steady gaming with LA gamers group; return to story games                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351930/#Comment_351930" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T12:18:45+00:00" title="December 19, 2011 12:18PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            gaming awesome:<br/><br/>* Origins and Burning Apocalypse con rocked my world this year.

Awesome people, you know who you are and I love you all. I really felt the community love this year.<br/><br/>* My Women in Gaming circle on G+ is the biggest most active circle I have. GO GAMER LADIES.<br/><br/>* Homebase gaming group has been rockin out with the creativity recently. We consistently have all the fun. Finished up a 2 year Exalted campaign to move on to WFRP hack in a fantasy frontier, Halo in Traveller and a new Sci-fi game as well as one shots circling in and out (most recently Technoir and Remember Tomorrow) make weekly games pretty sweet.<br/><br/>* Failed at making a gamechef game called A Beautiful Death, but going through the process and playtesting kicked my ass into gear. Inspired to work on Cyborg game again. Reading a lot and working on it!<br/><br/>* Started playing Go again.

Over the year we have fought Undead Barbarians, Mindflayers, Githyanki, Orcs, Spheres of Annihilation, Dracoliches, Beholders, Iron Golems, Trolls and more. <br/><br/>Monsterhearts - got a chance to play this up at BigBadCon run by Carl Rigney and it was easily one the best games I played all year. I cannot wait for this game to come out.<br/><br/>In addition to all of the Apocalypse World fun - <br/><br/>Sorcerer and Sword - played a short amazing game of this with Jesse run by CK, it was filled with Orcs, demons and buckets of blood. In the end my Orc killed a Demon with the shards of a giant cauldron artifact he had smashed. Big fun. <br/><br/>Heroquest - I have really enjoyed digging into Glorantha with my friends and can't wait to return next year to see how our little rebellion against the Lunar Empire will turn out.<br/><br/>Smallville - still enjoying the hell out of this game, got to play a D&amp;D inspired hack, ran an Exalted hack and a military Sci-Fi game titled "Conquered Stars" which allowed me to roll the trouble pool as a swarm of incoming nukes. <br/><br/>And more great con games than I can list. <br/><br/>I have been really fortunate to have had a year filled with great friends and gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352375/#Comment_352375" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T13:32:48+00:00" title="December 23, 2011  1:32PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pros:<br/>- Developing my Goblin Tarot Deck from concept to completion.

Restarting my podcast, <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play </a>, to talk about roleplaying games.  Three episodes since September, so I am slightly behind on my goal of one show per month but getting there.    <br/>2. TravellerCon, a little convention in Lancaster, Pennsylvania focused on, of course, Traveller.  The weekend spawned an article for <a href="http://www.freelancetraveller.com/magazine/2011-11/index.html" rel="nofollow">Freelance Traveller.</a> <br/>3.  Completing a Burning Wheel mini-campaign with the local gaming group.  The short campaign was marked by a cadre of three or four players but saw several others rotate in and out for various reasons and gave at least two players their first experience with Burning Wheel and non-traditional games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352978/#Comment_352978" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T15:39:09+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  3:39PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So many highlights! I went back through my email and tried to piece together all the games from the past year. It's been pretty crazy 'round here.<br/><br/><b>Old School Hack!</b> Only a short series (5 sessions) but so much fun. In a similar dungeon-bashy kind of way, we played a whole bunch of <b>Castle Ravenloft</b> and had a blast with it.<br/><br/>A really cool <b>Apocalypse World</b> series set in semi-hi-tech-feudal-Japan-with-zombies. Think <i>Afro Samurai</i> meets <i>Left 4 Dead</i>. I got to play a Chopper, then a Gunlugger (first time for each) so that was extra cool.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b>. Man, what a great game! Playing the emo-ness for laughs, Twilight-style, was especially fun (though it's great straight, too). Can't wait for it to be released for reals.<br/><br/>Also on the AW-hack front, had some really great sessions of <b>Dungeon World</b>, including a special event with The Doubleclicks at PAX (that's right, I'm name droppin' the muthafuckin <a href="http://www.thedoubleclicks.com/" rel="nofollow">Doubleclicks</a>). I'm so happy that DW is getting all the love it deserves.<br/><br/>Got a lot of fun and productive playtesting done on two of my own AW-hacks: <b>The Regiment</b> and <b>Imps</b>. Both are close to done-ness (at least in the game design department).<br/><br/>Finally played a whole series of <b>Freemarket</b>. Wonderful fun. I played a sensualist who wanted to experience everything. I highly recommend this as a Freemarket character type.<br/><br/>(Also finally) played <b>Leverage</b>. It delivered exactly what it promises: a killer heist game. Need to play a full series of that, still. Really made me appreciate Cortex Plus, and helped me understand the awesome inside Smallville even more.<br/><br/>Tony Dowler ran some sessions of <b>Talislanta 4th Edition</b> for me. I was a Sarista Witch. You have no idea you guys.<br/><br/><b>Murderous Ghosts!</b> Only played it once so far, but I love it. I know, shocking right.<br/><br/>Session four of the annual <b>Burning Russia</b> game. It delivered the goods, as usual. We added a new player (always tricky) and he was amazing.<br/><br/>Saw lots and lots of <b>Lady Blackbird</b> love, including the LB Companion and a score of cool hacks, culminating in the too-exciting-for-words, kickstarting <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wordstudio/always-never-now" rel="nofollow">Always/Never/Now</a>.<br/><br/><b>Go Play Northwest!</b> It was a huge love-fest, as usual. Also, discovered the wonder that is <b>Lost Worlds</b> (the duel-in-a-book game). <b>PAX</b> was also amazing, especially this year as I got to hang with even more online friends face to face.<br/><br/><b>Call of Duty: Black Ops</b>. Seriously got back into online play after a long hiatus and it was great. We had a little cadre of friends on Xbox Live there for a while, playing almost every night. I especially loved making little movies of my best moves and sharing them. And while I'm talking video games, let me also add: <i>LA Noire, Uncharted 3, Batman Arkham City, Portal 2, COD: MW3, Bastion, Outland, inFamous2, Frozen Synapse, Just Cause 2 (on OnLive) and Skyrim</i>. Whew!<br/><br/>Lowlight: A very awesome PTA series concept and cool characters that managed only a pilot episode. It just lost steam and got mired in scheduling hell. Oh well. Such is the fate of many a cool pilot, I guess.<br/><br/>Now that I've listed all that, I feel like there's something incredible from my game-o-sphere that I'm leaving out. It was a packed year! I must be forgetting something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352986/#Comment_352986" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T17:05:21+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  5:05PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could go on and on, (and already did for a boardgaming re-cap elsewhere), but I'll keep it brief and leave almost everything out.<br/><br/>GPNW and Gamestorm were both terrific as usual, but for gaming and conversing about games I <i>really</i> liked the three house cons I attended &amp; hosted.  I want more of that in 2012.  Magical.<br/><br/>Playing a ton of Apocalypse World, including MC'ing an ongoing game.  I can't say enough nice things about AW and its hacks.  I had some super games of Microscope and Archipelago II as well.<br/><br/>My favorite single session was probably my Sunday group's penultimate session of Pacific City.  Some great character arcs coming to intense fruition.<br/><br/>Fifteen contests of my precious War of The Ring, the boardgame that tells a captivating story with each play.<br/><br/>I did a lot more design work in 2011 than in previous years.  It's satisfying but really difficult; have to duel The Perfectionist every bleeding moment.  I'm close to sharing some of it maybe.<br/><br/>It was a very good year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353004/#Comment_353004" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T01:45:56+00:00" title="January  3, 2012  1:45AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2012 1:46AM by Wilhelm.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>I added another highlight the other day when<a href="https://yourbusinesssucks.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/brain-full-of-games-contest-winners/" rel="nofollow">I was one of the co-winners of the "Brain Full of Games" contest</a>run by the guy who does the How Not to Run a Game Business blog.
