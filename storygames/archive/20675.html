It's meant for a sanbox campaign. I can always use the consequences of whatever the players did on their previous stay, but I'd like to be able to spice it up when needed.<br/><br/>Edit: just checked <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Oracle-Cards-verified.pdf" rel="nofollow">The quiet Year's Oracle</a> and it could work wonders for what I want, but I'd have to remove most of the things that prompt players to make up stuff, or rewrite them so these can apply to things that have appeared on the vivinity while the PCs weren't there, like "the large body of water" or "the giant man-made structure". <br/><br/>I mean, as changes they sound pretty huge and while just this sounds really interesting and even explainable in a world where magic stuff happens, I dunno if it's too much to put them on a random table, as seeing these happening more than twice will sound unfeasible.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453932/#Comment_453932" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T11:46:24+00:00" title="June 17, 2016 11:46AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My friend made a small computer program that does this!  Everything's in Pathfinder notation, though.  Oh, and it's more for small factions than towns.  Hmm.  Well, crap, I've been meaning to dig through it and put the more settlement-relevant parts into text.  I shall consider this a reminder to do that.<br/><br/>In the meantime, if you find anything good, please let me know!<br/><br/>FWIW, I think my friend's main interaction model was antagonism.  Whatever happens to a town is a result of conflict with outside forces; whatever happens to a faction within a town is a result of conflict with other forces in town.  So, simple version of that off the top of my head:<br/>1) When the PCs leave a town, identify one or more conflicts within the town.  If possible, pick ones that the PCs already care about, or played a role in creating.<br/>2) Before the PCs return, roll to see who the victor was in each conflict.<br/>3) In your mind (or your notebook), heap power upon the victors and misfortune upon the losers, deforming the town accordingly.<br/><br/>I'm also working on a system where whatever the PCs do leaves lingering threads of consequence represented by dice, which can either peter out or explode depending on how the rolls turn out.  Far from done, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453938/#Comment_453938" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T17:32:09+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  5:32PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh great! I'd love to see the tables used by that program! I think I could do with pathfinder notation, though I'd prefer something less setting-specific.<br/><br/>I do make a lot of prep after the consequences of players actions, with no dice involved: if it's interesting it becomes reality. But sometimes they just behave and leave no consequences behind, at least in that town. Some things can actually come after them from other places but I'm looking more for a random table that could also generate towns they haven't visited yet. Kinda like Dogs in the Vineyard, but with more random content generation (because dogs is great but it's not like a good idea for a town pops into my mind everytime I see it's chapter about town creation. The idea is good but somehow there was always something missing for me there.<br/><br/>The best possible outcome from this is that the tables could be also used for factions. I mean, a town can perfectly be like a faction since it's a group of people striving to keep a communal status quo as a group objective, yet everyone can have personal goals that can contribute or even being against the community objectives. You can have both external and internal threats or positive events happen without PC intervention. I'll wait some more and keep looking for similar things but possibly my next step would be to build something up from the Quiet Year Oracle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
