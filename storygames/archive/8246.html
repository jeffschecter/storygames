"Do I chase my dreams or do I avoid conflict?"  <br/><br/>This morning, driving in, it struck me that most of the pieces of what I want may be floating around in Don't Rest Your Head.<br/><br/>Everyone starts with Potential (Discipline).  As they struggle to get through life, they wear themselves down (Exhaustion) until they take time to refresh.  Meanwhile, the pressures of life try to break them (Pain).  Do they give into Mundanity (Madness) to avoid suffering or do they cling optimistically to their dreams?  With each decision, Hope and Despair ebb and flow.<br/><br/>In order to bring it into the 'real world', the powers would need to be eliminated or toned down (maybe just re-skinned).<br/><br/>Now move the setting from "The Mad City" to "The Corporate World" and you have potential up-and-comers struggling against executive fiefdoms in a setting filled with corporate drones.<br/><br/>Now, I typically play RPGs/Storygames for escapism, but there feels like there is potentially something cathartic here.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181575/#Comment_181575" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T14:19:22+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  2:19PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2008 2:20PM by Rich Stokes.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't Rest <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvGwr5wj8A8" rel="nofollow">Your Stapler</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181625/#Comment_181625" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T21:57:31+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  9:57PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Call "Exhaustion" "burnout" and it tracks pretty well to the cycle of high-volume work in many of my jobs, where year-end peak eats the soul and then is magically done.  You try and keep your attitude positive during that time.<br/><br/>My only comment is to keep the powers, but tone them to things you can do in the corporate context.  Supernatural "blame-throwers" or "buzzwords of confusion".  The "Wally Principle" is a codex of lore in such a setting.  Nightmares are the things we all know are out there in certain environments - odd HR ideas, the Sales Promise Turned Problem, etc.<br/><br/>By leaving a toned amount of fantasy in it, you allow the catharsis to be aided by some good, old fashion power fantasy.  Alsom any game strictly about work would not be an incredibly compelling game to most players.  "Cubicles &amp; Consultants" is a joke game because no one would play it - without some sort of spice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181636/#Comment_181636" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T05:31:10+00:00" title="December  5, 2008  5:31AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call outs Judd.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181646/#Comment_181646" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T07:04:50+00:00" title="December  5, 2008  7:04AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wilson Zorn has adapted DitV to run Dogs at the Water Cooler, where the PCs are management consultants in a corporate environment, and has run it several times successfully.

There would be two ways to spin them: either they allow you succeed at Corporate World type things (lots of horrible mental diseases, supernatural weaknesses, or psychological vulnerabilities make people more effective workers if properly channeled) OR they provide a means to break out from the expected corporate behaviour because they are just so debilitating or otherwise place you outside the corporate structure.<br/><br/>So an exhaustion/burnout talent would be some core corporate ability at which your character is so incredibly terrible that it opens up otherwise inaccessible opportunities for him in a corporate environment. Just take a normal exhaustion talent (any human ability) and flip it. Dyslexia, no internal clock, world's worst speller, crippling agoraphobia, compulsive lying.<br/><br/>A madness talent would be a human failing taken to a monstrous, destructive, supernatural level. The ability to infect inanimate objects with your bad moods, repression to the point of literal invisibility, passive aggressive corporate memos that drive others to suicide, never having to breathe eat or sleep so long as you're on the clock. Procrastination that wastes other people's time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
