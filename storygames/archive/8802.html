You have one score that says how much the Army likes you, and a sanity score. You set scenes either in surgery, or pulling pranks. A successful surgery makes the Army like you more but decreases your sanity; a successful prank makes the Army like you less but increases your sanity. If your score for how much the Army likes you bottoms out, you go to a court martial. If your sanity score bottoms out, you go crazy. As the score for how much the Army likes you increases, your competence as a surgeon suffers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194856/#Comment_194856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-28T07:44:21+00:00" title="February 28, 2009  7:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How does this cover Colonel Potter or Major Winchester?

For a two-variable zero-sum system like this to work, something outside the player needs to create an imbalance. Ideally there should be mechanical effects as your stats increase -- how does surgical competency do anything for you? how does and increase in sanity affect you? external influences might just be other characters (GMless already!) but you still need to trigger the cycle.<br/>- Graham is bang on about needing more character scales than just Hawkeye.<br/>- I think I'll re-read games I already own that use a zero-sum trait scale.

This would gel more with the earlier seasons, where you had that very strong theme that to be a good soldier meant being a bad person.<br/><br/>Graham: Nice touch, I like it.<br/><br/>Halfjack: You could always keep throwing wave after wave of surgery at them. They have to report to surgery, so if they don't pull off some pranks, they'll just go insane. I think those two scales define pretty much everyone in the first three seasons, though; Hawkeye and Trapper, obviously, but Frank &amp; Hot Lips had high scores in the Army liking them and low competence scores, Klinger went for low Army and high sanity, Blake went for a little more of a balance.<br/><br/>You probably could play M*A*S*H with Shock: but what I really liked in the early seasons, at least, was the very strong anti-military theme and the pull between sanity &amp; competence vs. Army life. But I haven't really thought any of this through, and I don't really plan to do anything with it, so I figure I'll just throw it out there.

Jason Morningstar, report to the thread. That is all.<br/><br/>Medical Hospital basically does this (as I understand it) though it's a corporate, not military, bureaucracy that stresses the medical staff. But it's relationship-heavy (a BIG part of MASH's overarching themes) and, yes, you actually do the surgery. Though I'm now thinking there was maybe only a handful of "the surgery is CRITICAL" episodes. It was more a foil than a factor. Lots to ponder, with this idea. Heck, <i>It's Complicated</i> could be hacked for this (or not even hacked, just used as the engine). But I'm not sure of its support for episodic play.<br/><br/>And rather than sanity being a key, I'd let the player choose what eventual dysfunction they are fighting. Hawkeye definitely went ape-shit... though, recall, NOT due to surgery (sure, which was a source of stress) but due to essentially ordering (as he felt, in his guilt) a woman to suffocate her baby to protect a bus-load of people. But others become dysfunctional in different ways (unless one has a very broad definition of insanity). And some were never even remotely dysfunctional: Potter, Klinger (yes, Klinger), Radar, even Hot Lips: they all maintained, though (of course) each had their touching episodes of weakness. In a way, Hawkeye was unique--or, maybe, he had a foil in Winchester (denial was his dysfunction).<br/><br/>Interesting thought experiment. Hey!

Surgery is when all the characters tend to be present in one place, so it makes a great place to do things like address all the problems as a single unit.  Maybe an intro surgery scene could structure most episodes\u2026<br/><br/>Everyone rolls their dice at once.  In addition to seeing how these rolls relate to each other, the combined roll could express the tone of the episode.  The higher the roll, the greater the challenges to the unit as a whole, and the more the episode focuses on how well or poorly the characters work as a team.  The lower the roll, the more the challenges confront particular characters, and the more the episode focuses on relationships between individuals.<br/><br/>Let's say a total of 60 d6 dice were rolled.  If the unit were perfectly balanced, we would expect the total value of war d6s to be 105.  Similarly, we would expect the total value of isolation d6s to be 105.  Both values or either value might actually roll above or below what is expected.  As such, we get a 2 x 2 grid of ways in which lack of cohesion might be expressed in surgery.<br/><br/>High war + High isolation: Penicillin runs out while shells rain down on the camp and wounded pour in.  Find ways to survive and stay sane until a reliable connection with the Army can be reestablished.<br/><br/>High war + Low isolation:  An officer wants special treatment despite all the patients who are far worse off.  A dying enemy is caught, and there are many who want him dead right away or want him for immediate questioning, etc.  Take a moral stand, then trick or bully the other side into doing the right thing.<br/><br/>Low war + High isolation: Not much happening, but <i>everyone</i> is cold, hot, bored, ready to relax...except for that one person whose material comfort is making everyone else green with envy.  Wheel and deal, trick and treat. Compete to obtain or reinvent some item of "luxury", e.g., the warmest gloves in camp, the latest newspaper, etc.<br/><br/>Low war + Low isolation: The camp is visited by old acquaintances, investigators, etc.  I can't remember what broadly happens during these episodes.  Often pranks, but not so much the wheeling and dealing kind.  But I'll bet there's something broader going on that that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195356/#Comment_195356" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T20:18:35+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  8:18PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, guys. This is shaping up into something pretty hot.<br/><br/>I must say, though, that I'm shocked--shocked, I say!-to see Col. Potter held up as <i>the</i> M*A*S*H C.O. No love for Henry Blake? Don't get me wrong, I love Potter; he's tough, savvy, and ultimately compassionate. But that makes a BIG difference in the show's dynamic! It marks the transition to a whole different kind of story. Blake/Burns M*A*S*H is farce and satire, with Hawkeye and Trapper John as incorrigible Trickster Gods laying low their bumbling oppressors. Potter/Winchester M*A*S*H is a more thoughtful show of complex interconnections and fully-fleshed characters, where even beleaguered authority figures and  buffoonish oppressors are sympathetic.<br/><br/>It's important to know which show you're playing.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195381/#Comment_195381" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T00:22:01+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 12:22AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2009 12:31AM by Burr.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why either Blake or Potter?<br/><br/>For myself, I'd want a corrupt, vengeful colonel (but a good guy) who will drain the Army of its resources with glee, but who will also yell when by-the-book <i>appearances</i> aren't kept up.  He genuinely cares for the welfare of his subordinates and their patients, but he often manages through manipulation.  He's the worst surgeon in his outstanding team, and he's smart enough to realize it.  His best friend, a moderating influence on the colonel's passionate and scheming nature, is a brigadier general who is often hanging around camp, either in the colonel's office or near the still, preferring to command his own unit from afar.<br/><br/>Between the two of them, the colonel and general could quadruple as Honeycut, Winchester, Blake, and Potter.  There should be plenty of room for a Pierce, a Trapper, a Frank, a Hot Lips, a Klinger, a Radar, and a Father Mulcahy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195535/#Comment_195535" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T17:48:10+00:00" title="March  4, 2009  5:48PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if we're talking about departing from the established archetypes, mixing it up, making it your own, varying the theme. . .sure.
