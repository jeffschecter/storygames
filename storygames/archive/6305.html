The sixth still has a re-do outstanding. I edited them slightly to standardize the format, but haven't changed any content.<br/><br/><b>SCENE 1</b><br/><br/><i><br/>On the top floor of a museum: the room which holds the famed Orb of Methus. It's a very fancy museum: large stained glass windows on all sides, long, flowing drapes, etc. A handful of people have just rushed in.</i><br/><i>There has been a fight. There are dead and dying everywhere, in the room, and in adjoining corridors. The cops haven't shown up yet. One of the bloodied bodies begins to move.</i><br/>What Will Happen: <i>The wounded man will spring up, grab the Orb off its stand, and jump out of the museum through the stained glass window.</i><br/><b><br/>The Point</b>: You came here to steal the Orb.<br/><br/>Undercover Detective. Vision: A happy, safe family. Virus: Brutal beatings. Abuse: Impervious to Pain (been through so many beatings).<br/>Janitor. Vision: Wealth and retirement. Virus: Risky/illegal gambling.<br/>Local Sports Star. Vision: Adoring fans. Virus: Underage sex trade.<br/>Pretty Journalist. Vision: Extreme crime revealed. Virus: Experimental medicine/drugs.<br/><br/><b>SCENE 2</b><br/><br/><i>A biker gang's crashpad, an abandonded house in a forgotten suburb, rundown and graffitti'd, dimly lit, littered, and smoke filled.</i><br/><i>Some dirtbag owes some bikers some money and can't pay. He wants them to take his "girlfriend" (nearly underage naive runaway, he's been hoping to pimp) in trade.</i><br/><b><br/>The Point</b>: You're about to be forced from runaway to whore, or worse.<br/><br/>scumbag wannabe pimp vision:safety virus:wheedling<br/>biker leader vision:cash virus:intimidation<br/>berserker biker vision:oblivion virus:violence<br/>biker deviant vision:sex virus:drugs<br/><br/><b><br/>SCENE 3</b><br/><br/><i>The back aisle way at the track. The place where they put the nobodies and the nags.<br/>The trainer is juicing the horse to win and the boss has just offered you money to throw the race.</i><br/><br/><b>The Point</b>: you were just offered a lot of money to throw the race<br/><br/>The Owner. Vision: a path away from her husband. Virus: trick people into it.<br/>The Trainer. Vision: another day another dollar. Virus: showing off superior knowledge.<br/>The Boss. Vision: subservience from others. Virus: brutal violence<br/>The Owner's Husband. Vision: Superiority Virus: Throw money at it.<br/>The Groom. Vision: The Winners Circle. Virus: Skill with horses<br/><br/><b><br/>SCENE 4</b><br/><i>Brunswick Pest Control, an unwholesome concrete box in an industrial park.<br/>There's a new guy, a Mexican named Guzman who speaks like three words of English, and he's pretty easy going and eager to please. Glad to have any job. He's sitting on the locker room bench waiting for instructions.<br/></i><br/><b><br/>The Point</b>: Feld, your boss, just told you to send Guzman out without any protective gear. Feld thinks it's funny. Guzman will get sick, maybe get burned, maybe get cancer.<br/><br/>Guzman: Vision: A steady job. Virus: Innocence. Abuse: Become Anglo (Guzman has been hounded, deported, and beaten up as an illegal since he was 12.)<br/>Feld: Vision: Power. Virus: Cruelty.<br/><br/><b>SCENE 5</b><br/><br/><i>A large warehouse, or maybe a basement, reeking of old sweat and mold.<br/>Three half-naked people are waking up locked in a large cage, while a crowd of bloodthirsty thick-necked hicks bustle about outside the cage. As the prisoners awake, a chant begins: "Fight! Fight! Fight!"</i><br/><br/><b>The Point</b>: You are somehow responsible for the cage match.<br/><br/>Street thug combatant. Vision: His girlfriend's safety. Virus: Displays a tough guy attitude.<br/>Middle-manager office worker combatant. Vision: Top dog status. Virus: Ruthlessness and flexible morals.<br/>Stay-at-home mom combatant. Vision: Independence. Virus: Upholding order in her surroundings.<br/>Crowd's leader. Vision: Chaos. Virus: Screams and rants. Abuse: Contagious Madness (The crowd's leader has sustained self-abuse through heavy drug use.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139598/#Comment_139598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T09:42:39+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  9:42AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Owner's Husband in Scene 3 is the ultimate example character. that title, vision and virus together give me a wonderful image of a swaggering asshole, cigar on lip, tossing money at things he doesn't care about in a desperate attempt to win back the ones he loves. And then you couple that with the Owner, and it's solid gold.<br/><br/>Abuse: Become Anglo in Scene 4 is the ultimate example of an abuse. It is a solid, clear example of an Abuse, as well as a deadly example of what this game is about. Wonderful.<br/><br/>Thank you to my test people for this work you've done. Please whisper me or email me to tell me whether you'd like to be credited in the final product. I'm going to credit a Vision Team (design) and a Virus Team (actual play). If you want to be credited, you'll get your name under Vision and I'll send you a cool Vision jacket patch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139602/#Comment_139602" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T10:09:13+00:00" title="April 14, 2008 10:09AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

That's in the rules.<br/>I already broke some of the rules explaining scene creation to six people; I don't want to exacerbate the situation.<br/><br/>What I can tell you is that what you see above is exactly how prepared scenes in Cheap should look. Look at how Visions and Viruses interact. Check out The Point in each scene. It's some superb work, and the fact that others did it with my simple instructions means that the scene creation process seems to be fairly solid so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139683/#Comment_139683" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T23:13:00+00:00" title="April 14, 2008 11:13PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who has played the game and knows how it works, I find each of these scenes absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>Good stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
