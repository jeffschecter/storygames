However, he recently did a little add-on for <a href="http://www.realms.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Covenant</a> which I happen to think is very cool and deserves more people getting involved.<br/><br/>The <a href="http://www.realms.co.uk/codex/HomePage" rel="nofollow">Covenant Codex</a> is in familiar Wiki format, but has got me very excited about adding cities, factions, conventions and truisms for use in Covenant (which is a game I'm also very excited about).<br/><br/>You should take a look at it and maybe add some stuff. It deserves expanding and deserves more attention.<br/><br/>One thing I'm thinking: are collaborative things like this the way to go for collatig information for a game like Covenant? I think yes, they are very useful (as they are for so many things).<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81199/#Comment_81199" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-14T05:39:55+00:00" title="July 14, 2007  5:39AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, it wasn't quite ready for launch, but who cares! Feel free to sign up and add a few cool truisms or motifs.<br/><br/>I want to create a library of possible conventions, motifs and truisms that people can pick and chose for their games, as well as show some of the things you can do with them people might not have realised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
