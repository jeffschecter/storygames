Particularly since gaming has been slowly evolving from a fringe hobby to something recognized as an actual cultural (and pop culture) influence.<br/><br/>As someone of mixed heritage, the thing I have noticed a lot in gaming is how Euro-centric the games still tend to be (or perhaps I should say Western Euro/Northern Ameri-centric). I mean, it makes sense in a way, considering the roots of the hobby, and the majority of people who play such games. However, for many years there have been either sourcebooks for existing games or campaign settings that try to emulate other cultures or use the sensibilities of other cultures as inspiration (Oriental Adventures or Azteca for D&amp;D), L5R, Qin, Feng Shui, Hong Kong Action Theater, and many, many others. Very few, however, really get the feel of the non-Caucasian cultures across very well, and typically they will focus entirely on "popular" stereotypes or features of such cultures (ninjas and samurai, shaolin monks, Triads, Aztec warriors, etc.)<br/>Again, this makes perfect sense when you consider the audience the games are being marketed to, but one would hope that as the games and gaming itself becomes more sophisticated, that the material and cultures provided would similarly become more sophisticated. This has rarely been the case. I think, in the long run, Qin and (strangely enough) the old Oriental Adventures for D&amp;D have presented probably the best representations of Asia (and, similarly surprising the Palladium Ninjas &amp; Superspies and supplements). There's been a rare few that I have seen presenting Africa or South America as anything other than the savage stereotypes (I think the Vampire Africa book was one of the better ones in recent memory), and precious little for anything else. Scion is another that breaks a lot of the boundaries, too.<br/>So, I'm not sure this would be an actual question, per se, to pursue, but at least a launching point. Are we unable to bring other cultures and ethnic groups into our games without using stereotypes, or is there a way to bring a more robust representation of other peoples into the game, without having to write treatises on cultural development and interaction?<br/><br/>...okay, I think that does it for me... I'll shut up now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster" title="Alabaster"><img alt="Alabaster" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster">Alabaster</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276505/#Comment_276505" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T22:20:47+00:00" title="June 16, 2010 10:20PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2010 10:22PM by Alabaster.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To all the people who say minorities are not prevalent in gaming, I would urge you to reconsider. There are so many of us--not as many as there are straight white males, but that just reflects demography itself. The real question is: why do we not feel safe revealing ourselves?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer is that people are invariably incredibly bigoted or incredibly condescending. The second is somehow worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkin color and sexual orientation are only the most obvious targets--social class, poverty, education, dialect, accent are all vulnerable spots. How many times have I code-switched when entering a group of white, college-graduate gamers?--too many times to count. Their demeanor is so rigid and uptight, their self-worth and that of others so firmly invested in vocation and formal education--you have to cultivate a superficial veneer of "whiteness" or they quickly turn uncomfortable, feeling as if they have to either relate to you or reject you (bigotry versus condescension).<br/>\n<br/>\nIgnorant mainstream gamers erect huge barriers of fake weird bullshit based on their privileged, sheltered upbringings. Topple that, and minority gamers will be more visible because it won't be so bullshit just to exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for the book, you're saying that your friend doesn't know what she's going to write about, but that she is putting herself in the position of finding out for other people? What are her qualifications for being a minority spokesperson? And how could one person speak for so many? I could see her compiling different experiences and enlisting the words and thoughts of a wide variety of minority gamers, that would make sense--but not a one person project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276527/#Comment_276527" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T04:32:28+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  4:32AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, as a teen, I played RPGs with a gay friend of mine.

But to add to it, I know you as a man who cares about art and expression and strives for intellectual honesty. <br/><br/>And none of those can be achieved to their fullest extent while we are (either willfully, blindly, or some combination of the two) removing voices, visions, understandings, modes of thinking, doing, speaking, and being from the potential scope of response. <br/><br/>Also, dude... you're a freaking minority here. Didn't you once write an article for some crazy magazine about how the American media monstrosity effect and affect the creation and distribution of RPGs in Finland? Or am I mistaking you for one of those other miscellaneous folks from the land of ice and snow where the crippling cold and unpronounceable languages destroy all your ability to compete with the production value of American games? <br/><br/>How are you going to deal with that? An American makes a mediocre game and they can market to damn near the whole world in their native language. You do it and you've got a potential audience of what, three people? How does that -- the linguistic colonialism of English -- hit how you play and what you play and what place what you produce has in the various communities? <br/><br/>And why should I care? <br/><br/><br/><br/>Graham, <br/><br/>I'd like someone to look at the Japanese RPG scene and what "minority" means there. Do white guys teaching English in Tokyo get in with the Japanese college kids playing these crazy games that Andy is translating? Or do the communities not really interact? Ditto the situation with Japanese RPGers in Los Angeles -- how much do they cross over with the fairly large non-Japanese RPGing community there? <br/><br/>And, I'd like someone to look at how/if/what the different patterns of interaction between American power/race/gender groups in play as opposed to those in England. To black British youth react the same way to D&amp;D and World of Warcraft that black American youth do? And do white British kids react to them reacting... and you can take it from here, right? <br/><br/>Furthermore, in general, I'd like some specific case study style work on this. Don't get me wrong, I like generic guides to generic principles... but I can't help but think there is going to be a lot more meat in looking at specific cases in specific places rather than a generic "minorities in gaming everywhere and every time" approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276839/#Comment_276839" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T18:59:04+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  6:59PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand,<br/><br/>Thank you for writing something so smart.<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276843/#Comment_276843" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T19:38:11+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  7:38PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham since you're in England and thus presumably your friend is as well, I'm very curious about the white-on-white "racism" over there that I occasionally see expressed in U.K. media.

The Scottish girl in an English neighborhood... yeah, you're coming with me."  <br/><br/>I also remember hearing something about how Torchwood being shot in Wales and having a lot of Welsh cast members was this BIG DEAL.

Seems like a fine way of taking the wind out of her sails.<br/><br/>In case somebody is now imagining me as some wacky sort of bigot for not automatically acceding to the need of a gamer minority rights declaration, perhaps I should open my viewpoint on this matter a bit more: not only am I a member of what is considered the ethnic and gender "majority" in the American culture, but I'm also a national of a relatively sheltered, distant country on the edge of Europe, far from everywhere. Finland does not have a history of ethnic upheaval, nor a colonial past - not even feudalism or repression of women, the latter having gained the right to vote here first in Europe, and never having been owned, nor had their right to own property taken away from them. Even racism has to be consistently imported, and it tends to be that the Finnish racist ironically resembles nothing so much as a conceited knock-off of a British skinhead. I do not have a background that would make treatment of minorities a strong identity issue for me - I would wager that I'd have a fair shot in any "more liberal than thou" competition we'd care to have, but that simply doesn't translate into an exaggerated sense of minority rights because I don't have to deal with minority issues in my everyday life. I am well aware that I am in no way qualified to judge the American social niceties around the black minority, for example - a black man is a mere curiousity to me, incidental as much as hair color or a weird accent, simply because I don't have 10,000 black people with their own subculture and history living right on the south side of the tracks.<br/><br/>The above perspective includes my gaming. I have no inborn experiences or personal interest in the issue of minorities in roleplaying games, at least not in anything more than the most superficial way. This naturally raises the question I broached: why should I care? Is there some hidden injustice going on in gaming that I'm not seeing? Is some minority of gamers being repressed by social mechanisms of gaming and I'm not seeing it? I certainly am interested if this is the case, I'm pretty big on human rights. But from where I'm standing it's up to the writer of this hypothetical book to convince me that I'm upholding some patriarchy or racialist regime in gaming even without realizing it myself. So that's why I answered the question the way I did: the first thing I would want from a book like this would be for it to convince me that there is a problem. Without that we do not have a minority rights topic, but rather just minority self-aggradisement. The latter is of course well and good if you're into that, but what I'd be interested from a book like this would specifically be the issue of right and wrong.<br/><br/>Specifically, I want to emphasize that my suggestion was not intended in the spirit Dylan took it: I did not want to say that I refute the idea of minority rights or the significance of these people as individuals in gaming. My suggestion for the prospective writer was not a backhanded rhetorical declaration of how very unimportant minorities are to me. To the contrary, the question and challenge was genuine: I do not currently know of any reason for me to be interested in minorities in gaming. Last I heard they were doing just fine, as much as they do in their respective cultures, anyway. Is there some institutional repression or other concerns going on in gaming? If there are, write about those, because that's what I want to know about. The same goes for positive news, I suppose, although that was not emphasized in my initial suggestion: if minorities have the power to improve my gaming somehow, do tell.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: I come from a radically different and more homogenous culture in this regard, and am not able to talk your minority-tolerant lingo facilely. I will sound like a jerk if I discuss this issue at all simply because I don't understand how serious this is to you all. Therefore, what I'd like from a book like this would be for it to show me that there is an issue to be considered, how I'm part of the problem (if that is what I am), and how I could be a part of the solution. I admit to being slightly sceptical, but that's just because I don't have that affirmative action viewpoint you get by living your life with a real minority problem. I'll believe it when I see it.<br/><br/>(Reading this, the above makes it seem like I consider myself somehow perfectly tolerant. This is not the case, there are certainly identity issues that matter to me, even if they're not minority issues. I'm just race-blind and largely gender-blind due to my upbringing in a culture with such minor racial and gender issues that you wouldn't believe.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276847/#Comment_276847" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T20:11:07+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  8:11PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Writing the above got me into thinking, perhaps I do have a minority experience of sorts in my gaming. Consider this: even as I don't construe of women or "races" as minorities in the usual sense of stereotyping and so on, I sort of have this relationship with religion. Do Christians count as a minority in gaming even when they're not all that outside the subculture? If they do, I've totally got some context for this thing: the Finnish rpg scene is notably liberal, noticeably more so than the rest of the country, and being a gamer usually makes other people automatically assume that you'll share their liberal values and some brand of agnosticism. One of my best friends, a gamer himself, is a Christian, too, so this comes up regularly. If nothing else, I heckle him about his curious superstitions while he takes the high ground with amusement.<br/><br/>Hmm... this Christian angle might not have been a good idea, as this'll sound extra awful when applied to other minorities. It just happens to be that the question I would like this prospective writer to answer about the Christian gamer minority is this: should Christianity be encouraged among gamers, or should the culture be intentionally driven into opposition to conservative values, religiosity included? I'm not taking the piss here, this is a current question in the Finnish rpg scene - the great majority of us activists share a certain set of liberal values and work actively to emphasize them in our art, albeit not in any sort of coordination or with political intent. Should we remain tolerant of the Christian conservative minority, and if so, how? Should we in fact do more to make the medium of roleplaying less politically charged? Or should we try to effect an even more clear alignment of the whole hobby culture with the humanist worldview, perhaps to a degree that makes opposed viewpoints feel actively unwelcome instead of just ignored? Can you roleplay without being political? If you can't, is it good if we reinforce our value systems by our play, or should we strive actively to accomodate differences, even where we feel the opposition to be wrong?<br/><br/>Obviously enough I don't want to ask that question about non-ideological minorities. Even asking it about religion is sort of borderline for anybody who considers religion a non-ideological, inherent part of human identity, just like gender or race. Still, the issue is real enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster" title="Alabaster"><img alt="Alabaster" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster">Alabaster</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276848/#Comment_276848" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T20:12:51+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  8:12PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So a long, long history of people slurring and ostracizing minorities at the gaming table, and for that matter, the huge, populous world of online gaming, which in many instances is a relentless slew of nigger-faggot-nigger-faggot repeated into infinity, is not enough to show there is a problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not that gaming is a bigoted activity, it's that the society within which gaming takes place is bigoted.

I don't need to be told that there is a jerkface somewhere, and he plays roleplaying games.<br/><br/>What I don't quite understand - and would be interested in seeing developed as an argument - is what types of special bigotry gaming involves. I do care about the gaming culture and want to develop it, after all. I even feel like I have more of a hand on the roleplaying culture, at least locally, than I have on the problem of bigotry in general. Is roleplaying especially bigoted in some special way that requires it to be addressed as gaming? Perhaps this comes back to that topic I suggested for the book - whether there is such a thing as a special minority issue in gaming as opposed to the world in general, and if so, how come?<br/><br/>I don't have any reason to think that bigotry is not real. It's just a very rare phenomenon in my own life, which is why I suggested that a writer writing on minorities in gaming might want to open by explaining how the topic is relevant to a reader who doesn't live with it daily.

Or, in name of humbleness, because I can guess how this sound to you guys - I <i>think</i> that <i>I</i> don't really live in a microculture with minority issues, in gaming or otherwise. Not only there are no doubt Finns with different experiences, but I'm sure that it's also possible that I'm simply mistaken and blind to some institutional minority problem in my life - in gaming or outside it. For this reason I think that a book about the topic would have to start with some rigorous claims, powerful opinions and an energetic take in general, so that it could help me either see through my blindness on the matter or point out to me how the topic is still relevant for me even if I haven't faced it personally.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, the closest I've come to bigotry in gaming has been seeing the attitude that particularly nerdy Americans display towards women on web forums; sometimes it truly seems that they think of women as a different species that is constitutionally unable to understand gaming (unless you add pink unicorns, anyway). I think I saw something like this recently... <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=479164" rel="nofollow">here</a>, at rpg.net: a wonderfully weird look into what a roleplayer thinks might interest a woman in a roleplaying game.

My motivation in all of this is that I firmly know I am a part of everyone else, and would like to become more so, rather than less.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276858/#Comment_276858" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T22:04:12+00:00" title="June 18, 2010 10:04PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Actually, this started to bother me now.

I would argue that having cross-cultural relationships can be an informative, growthful, and probably difficult thing, but not having these experiences certainly doesn't make you a racist, just ignorant of certain things, and I mean the word "ignorant" in the most textbook, non-connotative way possible. That claim would just puzzle me.<br/><br/>I'd guess that the reason you're not sensitive to the N-word is that Finland doesn't have the same negative history with regards to people of African descent that the U.S. does. But I don't really know about Finland's history or current cultural make-up. Maybe it does and you're just insensitive?<br/><br/>And, at least in the U.S., being "color-blind" is sort of the old mode of trying to overcome racism. It smacks of the "melting pot", which really means, "we all become white." Multiculturalism and Color-blindness, as values, are at odds.<br/><br/>anyway, this isn't to the topic at hand. sorry. I really don't think I have an answer to your original question, Graham. I suppose I'd just like to see a woman or someone who's culturally in the minority write about what they want to write about, with regard to gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276860/#Comment_276860" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T22:33:13+00:00" title="June 18, 2010 10:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread....man, I don't know where to begin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276862/#Comment_276862" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T23:29:26+00:00" title="June 18, 2010 11:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>For what it's worth, the closest I've come to bigotry in gaming has been seeing the attitude that particularly nerdy Americans display towards women on web forums; sometimes it truly seems that they think of women as a different species that is constitutionally unable to understand gaming (unless you add pink unicorns, anyway).</blockquote>\nEero, here's one thing to consider regarding your gender privilege, or at least how you are expressing yourself in English (which is a language with plenty of sexist overtones) --<br/><br/>You wrote about "particularly nerdy Americans ... they think of women as a different species."

Something to score points when I use language carelessly, as opposed to considering my true intentions? It's true that I was thinking of American men when making that statement, of course. In that light it's pretty ironic that you sometimes see women who've internalized similar ideas; I guess they consider themselves freaks of some sort, similarly to men who take this "geek" self-identification too seriously.<br/><br/>In general I don't think that I'm particularly gender-aware in any positive way, even if I don't recognize any misogyny in myself, either. This is totally a cultural issue, I've just been raised differently - justice, honor and universal human rights instead of sensitivity to particular issues and viewpoints of other people. (You can sort of see the Soviet influence in the Finnish value environment in cases like this, incidentally.) Makes me prone to consider color-blindness, gender-blindness and whatnot as a basis of fairness more than special minority circumstances. Specifically, I'm not a very good feminist - as the old saying goes, I don't treat women any different than I treat men.<br/><br/>But anyway, this thread wasn't supposed to be about my privilege-induced blindness to the suffering of minorities.

There are no points scored here.<br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind as someone who automatically falls into a privileged class (especially when talking to a bunch of North Americans and Brits), your words can and do have an effect on oppressed people <i>regardless of your specific intent</i>, especially if those words go in the direction of societal oppression. It may very well be that you're a sweet guy and didn't mean anything by implying that American gamers default to male. It may be that the next guy along wasn't thinking anything evil by assuming that either. Or the next guy. But the net effect may be that these people who didn't <i>intend</i> to do anything wrong have <i>unintentionally</i> created an environment that hurts women gamers.\n<blockquote>In that light it's pretty ironic that you sometimes see women who've internalized similar ideas; I guess they consider themselves freaks of some sort, similarly to men who take this "geek" self-identification too seriously.</blockquote>\nActually, it's not ironic at all. Adoption of internalized sexist tropes is sadly one of the few defense mechanisms against a very sexist society. This includes women who -- in order to reconcile their love for "geek"/"nerd" things that aren't considered "traditionally feminine" according to sexist society -- decide that they really aren't women in the same way that other women are considered "feminine."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster" title="Alabaster"><img alt="Alabaster" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster">Alabaster</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276870/#Comment_276870" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-19T00:51:29+00:00" title="June 19, 2010 12:51AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic assumptions and statements and questions you're making, Eero, don't even have anything to do with the actual discussion about the book, which should be constructive, not nullifying. The conversation is not enriched by declarations of how much you lack exposure to the topic. Yet again, those with privilege feel they should have control and dominion over every space, no matter how irrelevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it really right that a thread about minorities, intended to explore minority issues, should spend so much time talking, not about actual minorities, but about the protests of a single white, privileged male, with a self-confessed total lack of interest and connection to minorities? Why is it that people will spend so much wordspace to tell us that they have no opinion, and can't be arsed to have an opinion? Isn't that just a bunch of big negatives?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have posted concrete questions, details, honest inquiries, discussion--yet much of it has been derailed by privileged chat. Some of the very questions you are asking us right now were covered in the link I posted earlier. Specifically, "If You Won't Educate Me How Can I Learn" and "Unless You Can Prove Your Experience Is Widespread I Won't Believe It".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What do you want to know about minorities in roleplaying games? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12325/what-do-you-want-to-know-about-minorities-in-roleplaying-games/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="What do you want to know about minorities in roleplaying games? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12325/what-do-you-want-to-know-about-minorities-in-roleplaying-games/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I don't know what to tell you, Dylan.

I've encountered a lot of minority members in my life, am very sensitive to all kinds of N-words and so on. I'm from Helsinki, I suppose that matters. Sort of casual racism is pretty much a norm in Finland (and the rest of Europe), I have to say, especially when it comes to males. Self-described "colorblinds", who're simply not that interested in your background like Eero are actually usually the most advanced folks you meet in Finland, PC-wise. <br/><br/>Now, if one is already tolerant (even if little ignorant), what can he do to improve the well-being of minorities of gaming? Like Eero, I really want some more concrete stuff. For example, are some of the following RPG tropes things you shouldn't include a lot in your campaign/game: topless female captives, effeminate gays, chainmail bikinis, black slaves, rape, noble savages? Should you let every decent person join in your campaign, even if he/she has very different background than the rest of your group? Maybe I'm thinking too much in black and white, but nothing seems to come from thinking in tones of gray. It's time for some moral maxims now, or at least some less abstract stuff.<br/><br/>Also, it'd be nice to have more women and minorities to find the joys of gaming, but it's a bit patronizing to think that we can just add things those groups supposedly like and get them in. We can maybe make some obvious generalization like "women are not that into stuff like Savant &amp; Sorcerer cover", but I'm really wary of doing even that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277787/#Comment_277787" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T02:38:00+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  2:38AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2010 2:38AM by Potemkin.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Graham since you're in England and thus presumably your friend is as well, I'm very curious about the white-on-white "racism" over there that I occasionally see expressed in U.K. media.  Like in the first episode of the current season of Doctor Who there's a point where The Doctor is goading the new companion into coming with him.  He says something like, "Come on!  The Scottish girl in an English neighborhood... yeah, you're coming with me."<br/><br/>I also remember hearing something about how Torchwood being shot in Wales and having a lot of Welsh cast members was this BIG DEAL.  The way I heard it, it sounded like this was some kind of major cultural breakthrough in U.K. media.<br/><br/>That kind of stuff BLOWS my American mind.  Unless, I'm being told incorrectly or misinterpreting.<br/><br/>Does any of that enter into your role-playing over there?<br/><br/>Jesse</blockquote>\nI thought I'd field this.<br/> The first thing to understand about the U.K that, despite being united, there are some very real cultural rifts between its constituent nations that makes, by way of analogy, the U.S/Canada divide seem like split hairs. <br/>Generations of inflicted poverty, near-genocidal warfare and general disenfranchisement by England has left deep scars in the scottish psyche; there are some battlefields where the English simply aren't welcome. Similarly, the territory of Northern Ireland and the quietly on-going conflict there remains as a testament to Protestant-English colonialism, much to the resentment of the Irish. Even today, Northern England, Wales and Cornwall are burdened by a feeling of provincialism; London and the affluent south being the soul recipient of the vast majority of the nation's wealth.<br/>The BBC, as a London-based institution, often comes under fire for provincialism - setting a great deal of its programs in London or targeting them at a London-based demographic - so the use of Welsh extras has a certain potency. <br/>As for the Doctor's sidekick being a Scottish girl in an English village; I think the program's intent was to highlight her cultural alienation, her Otherness, and hence her willingness to drop the pretense of belonging and travel with the Doctor. <br/><br/>It's not so much white-on-white "racism" as it is a complex relationship based on a very real notion of nationalism, tied in strongly with concepts identity, wealth and class-allegiances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277788/#Comment_277788" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T03:04:29+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  3:04AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2010 3:06AM by Thunder_God.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding this "White-on-white" question, you don't have to go to the UK, you can <a href="http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/01race/white13.htm" rel="nofollow">remain</a> safely in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Irish-Became-White-Noel-Ignatiev/dp/0415918251" rel="nofollow">USA</a>.<br/><br/>Though it may be anachronistic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277797/#Comment_277797" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T05:38:02+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  5:38AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have another question:<br/><br/>Why does everyone think that men are the majority RPG players?

Women aren't asking you to "add things we like". Gaming is hugely diverse in terms of gameplay/fiction available. We're asking you to get rid of the things that make us feel not welcome - the de-protagonization of women in gaming texts, the porntacular representations of women in art, and the trope of sexual violence against women being valid "character drama".

I have seen it happen that the issue was activated by gaming: the, shall we say, social ineptness of a certain subset of the gaming population, but even then it's been ignorance rather than malice.<br/><br/>(Here is where I flash my credentials, such as they are: I'm an out gay man.  It's a lot easier for me to pass as a non-minority than it is for a woman or a person of color, but to be honest, it's repugnant to do that so I'm only likely to bother if my safety is in question or if a great revelation at the right moment will enhance a smackdown -- there was a magic moment some years ago at a boffer-combat LARP where one of my friends' teenage son was using some fairly homophobic slurs, and my friend said, "You know, one of the players here, one of the people you know, is gay.  How do you think he would feel if he heard you saying those things?")<br/><br/>What really pisses me off is an essentialist, reductionist view of people.  "This is what gay gamers want."  Well, no, frankly: I don't think what I want, except in a few fairly restricted areas that don't generally come up at the gaming table, can be clearly defined by my sexual orientation.  I agree with wundergeek: "We're asking you to get rid of the things that make us feel not welcome."  It really doesn't bother me that everyone in your D&amp;D world or your Star Trek game is straight, for instance; a lot of that is fidelity to the source material.  It *does* bother me if people in your D&amp;D world or your Star Trek game are universally homophobic, or if homosexuality is used as an evil-marker, or if the only gay people are bad stereotypes.    <br/><br/>And then there's the problem of in-game versus out-of-game: what happens if you're playing in a setting inspired by Dune, where only women are Bene Gesserit?  Or the Wheel of Time, where male Aes Sedai are all insane? Or in a historically-inspired game, where dark people are good and white people are Christian infidels?  There's a qualitative difference between minority issues and discrimination in the fiction and minority issues and discrimination around the table, but there's no clear line between them and they bleed over into each other. <br/><br/>All that said, in actual published gaming texts, I think it turns into an even thornier issue of marketing.  In a published game, the publisher has to balance the tastes and prejudices of the target audience against his or her vision of the game.  Including an explicitly gay character, or a romantic subplot in a campaign-setting metaplot, will cause some people to not buy the product.  Including pictures of women in chainmail bikinis will appeal to a certain subset of the market; if the publisher leaves out those pictures, will there be enough extra sales to offset the reduced sales to cheesecake-seeking buyers?  This is not likely to be easy to disentangle from issues of discrimination and minority treatment in the larger society.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277833/#Comment_277833" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T09:38:37+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  9:38AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it is just this thread but this book, or the discussion of this book feels like it is about minorities, written by the majority, for the majority.<br/><br/>"There, there majority, let me make you feel better about those scary minorities, making you feel guilty about stuff you didn't even do wrong.

I think there are things that are a lot more important than my orientation that I express through gaming.  I think it's tempting to look for simple causes and effects and useful generalities, but I think that as soon as you get beyond the most trite and obvious -- "gay people don't care to play at the table with groups that use a lot of homophobic slurs," "women don't care to play in game groups that objectify and deprotagonize women" -- you really get into a complicated mess.<br/><br/>I don't think there is any single identifying thing that I do at the game table that expresses myself as a gay gamer.  I know I'm more willing than the average gamer to consider other sexualities in the fiction, but that's not much of a differentiator -- I know straight gamers who do the same.  And the very question starts heading in the direction of essentialism: that there are qualities that every gay person has (at least beyond the obvious tautological ones).  This is something that gave me a heck of a lot of trouble in my own history -- let it suffice to say that I am not fabulous, nor do I have a killer fashion sense -- and so I find the notion of imposing essentialist criteria on other people reprehensible.

I imagine that the participation of women has increased since then although probably more so in the indie crowd than elsewhere.

A game is a tool for entering (simulated) experiences ourselves; that can be a lot of things, from transformative to repellent, but it is always a layer of abstraction over directly saying something about a minority experience.

So calling attention to issues of misrepresentation and often-unintentionally hostile environments is a good thing in my view, but trying to isolate and identify what gay gamers do is far too essentialist for my tastes.<br/><br/>GB Steve, I think it's more that there are people who are trying chasing cheese down a steep hill to see if they like it, and they're being driven away not by any necessary quality of the cheese-chasing, but by the attitudes of the other participants.  I mean, I've heard horror stories from women my age: my teenage D&amp;D plotlines involved killing monsters and taking treasure, while theirs involved the rape and pregnancy of their characters.  I've never had to face the decision of playing an opposite-sex character in order to avoid having my character's reproductive system be a major focus of the game's plot, and I can imagine that if that had been the case when I was first getting involved in the hobby, I might not have stayed involved in it.<br/><br/>I think the question is not "should we do outreach?"  I think the question is, "why do gamer demographics not match the local demographics?"  If 50% of the population is female, then unless there's something essential about women or essential about gaming that indicates otherwise, 50% of the gamer population should be female. If that's the case, and 19% of the gamer population is female, there's something cultural that draws men in greater numbers or drives women off, and it's worth asking ourselves what that is.<br/><br/>(And actually, as far as that particular example goes, I think part of the problem may be measurement: I recently found out about "simming," which is, as I understand, basically freeform roleplaying in established fictional worlds, and which has a predominantly female demographic.  The problem may be that we're all doing what we'd recognize as story-gaming, but we come at it from the wargames-D&amp;D-system matters route, and they come at it from the Diana Gabaldon or Star Trek fanfic side.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster" title="Alabaster"><img alt="Alabaster" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster">Alabaster</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278001/#Comment_278001" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T03:42:49+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  3:42AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GB: Roleplaying, and indeed, playing games is a universal human drive, for everyone on some level or another, if only rudimentary.

And it seems to mainly happen here because it's one of the few social fitness options for women who don't want to be competitive and who don't want to be ogled.  There is nothing essential about women that makes yoga more suited to them; instead, it's a cultural and social thing that drives them to it in greater numbers.  <br/><br/>And the gay nightclub thing?  Well, the gay nightclub, as a place to meet other people who are gay, is dealing with something essentially gay: the need to find a romantic partner of the same sex.  This is a problem that straight people do not need to solve.  <br/><br/>And yes, I support the right of people to be as boorish as they like.  There are probably always going to be groups full of homophobic jerks, and it's pretty safe to say that those groups are not for me.  However, if the vast majority of groups are full of homophobic jerks, that's not just a matter of individual group preferences -- that's something deeply skewed in the culture.  It goes beyond "those people play in a way I wouldn't like," and well into "those people play in a way that dehumanizes me."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278015/#Comment_278015" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T07:59:15+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  7:59AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, we agree, roleplaying isn't inherently discriminatory - but the question as to why it appears to be the bastion of the <i>young</i>, while middle-class male remains. <br/><br/> I think the fault lies with <i>marketing</i>; the whole hobby is <i>sold</i> - either through active corporate advertisement or by subtle social implications - in relation to a whole raft of other activities dominated by the same demographic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278020/#Comment_278020" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T08:41:38+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  8:41AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps good roleplayers could target those yoga groups, black churches and gay nightclubs where they are only not roleplaying because of the racist bigotry of certain other roleplayers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278078/#Comment_278078" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T15:16:45+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  3:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alabaster</cite>GB: Roleplaying, and indeed, playing games is a universal human drive, for everyone on some level or another, if only rudimentary.

The <i>hobby of playing tabletop role-playing games</i> -- i.e., sitting around a table rolling dice and pretending to be an elf -- is only one very specific way of expressing the desire to play a role and play a game. Saying that participating in the tabletop role-playing game hobby is something that mainly white guys do (and yes, GB Steve only said "roleplaying" -- interpreting it as strictly as I did might mean I was way off base, or might just mean I was reading charitably) isn't like saying "music is something mainly white guys do", it's more like saying "composing Baroque symphonies is something mainly white guys do."<br/><br/>I don't think there's anything surprising or sinister in the fact that a hobby invented by white guys only a few decades ago is still mainly enjoyed by white guys. I also don't think that D&amp;D and its unruly crop of children and grandchildren are the only way to combine the notions of "playing a game" and "playing a role".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278103/#Comment_278103" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T19:59:06+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  7:59PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            the ONE time race has come up at the game table about a game was with the popular board game puerto rico and it's thinly veiled slaves, small brown colored wooden disks that arrive at the island via a ship and are used to work plantations. one of my friends was deeply offended by that game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther then that my experience has told me that nerd heritage is much stronger then racial or even gender ties.

And really, indie gaming, being marginal, has always seemed more friendly to the marginal than most other gaming. We have all kinds of cool games about the most esoteric, niche topics--I feel good about the future.

The thought process seems to run, "people are complaining about homophobia in gaming, I'm not gay, therefore they're accusing me of being a homophobe."  The thing is, it's not the people who worry about it who are the problem.  It's the people who simply don't care -- the ones throwing around slurs and epithets at the gaming table, and who claim their right to freedom of speech as a defense.  And it's the people who don't think it's a problem, whether because they've never actually considered it or because they considered it and rejected the idea that it might be a problem.<br/><br/>I, like Alabaster, have found story gaming more friendly than trad gaming, though I haven't found trad gaming all that unwelcoming either; although that might have more to do with my own particular minority status and with my geographic location.  <br/><br/>And, to be honest, I see a lot of threads like this as fairly useless: I don't think I'm likely to convince much of anyone simply by talking.  I think people were talking past each other 20 posts in, and since then it's only gotten more entrenched.  But who knows?  Maybe there's a lurker who's reading this who realized something he or she didn't know before, and after a thousand such threads, things may start to change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278152/#Comment_278152" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T12:18:13+00:00" title="June 27, 2010 12:18PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>but it still stands on a landscape full of white people talking.</blockquote>\nHELLO!
