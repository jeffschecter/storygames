The surviving women face not only the enormous task of rebuilding society, but also the possible extinction of humanity.<br/><br/>While the graphic novel Y the Last Man by Brian K. Vaughn and Pia Guerra inspired the world of the larp, the game does not use any characters or storylines from the graphic novel. Our story follows a group of women who have applied to an insemination program initiated three years after the disaster. As sperm has become a very precious resource, only a few women will be given this privilege. Players will portray women applying to the insemination program in familial groups of three. <br/><br/>This run of the game is open to everyone who identifies as female in one form or another. And the people who sign-up may self-select whether this applies to them.<br/><br/>One of the game creators, Tor Kjetil Edland, <a href="http://nordiclarptalks.org/post/16316217492/not-another-story-about-boy-meets-girl" rel="nofollow">has a great Nordic Larp Talk about the game</a>.<br/><br/><a href="http://lizziestark.com/2012/07/26/mad-about-the-boy-sign-up/" rel="nofollow">And here is sign up for the October 5-8 run in Orange, Connecticut</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
