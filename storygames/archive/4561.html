Since they bring you free drinks, I had four consecutive Red Bulls, then nearly fell out of my chair from the shaking.  When I got back to my room, my friends were drinking vodka and cran, and poured me a drink.  After downing the first one in a gulp, I asked for another, then made a bet that I could stay conscious for ten minutes.  I lost, with seven minutes to spare.<br/><br/>I watched the biggest (semi-regular) poker game in the world being played in Bobby's Room at the Bellagio.  Sam Farha and Jennifer Harmon were there, Phil Ivey showed up.<br/><br/>One day, having not seen anyone I knew for days despite being there with about 12 guys, I ran into some of them on the floor of the casino where we were staying, and they asked if I wanted to go to a basketball game.  I didn't have much else to do, so I went.  We got stoned in the car on the way to the Thomas and Mack center, and then watched Team USA demolish Puerto Rico.  Watching Dwayne Wade, Lebron James, Gilbert Arenas and so forth in person was really cool - I'll probably never get another chance.  Since I was sitting on the outside, they sent me for food.  I had to stand in two different lines, one for the massive hot dogs, one for the beer.  By the time I got back to my seat, I had finished my food...and someone else's.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've always wanted to go to The Gun Store.

It was dark and empty except for the lights from outside, and the floors were still covered with newspaper and construction trash.  We weren't even staying at the Venetian, but we'd somehow wandered into the pool complex, and from there we took an elevator up to the highest floor we could get to, where there was a desk for a concierge who wasn't there.  In fact, the entire place seemed empty, so we wandered around as quietly as in a church, oggling their collection of jams and the maids' closet with shelf upon shelf of complimentary slippers, and then found a stairway heading up.  Once we came back down from the ballroom, an officious security guard with a mustache asked us to leave, which is just what we were doing at that point anyway.

They were in groups of two to six, standing apart on either side of the sidewalk, each with a stack of six or eight individual cards ready to hand to a passer-by. They never said a thing. They just snapped the little stacks of cards in their hands. Snap, and then hold them out for someone to take. Snap. Again. I was collecting the cards with plans to play <a href="http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue5/pimp2.html" rel="nofollow">Pimp</a>. Each hand-off was an economical and polished exchange. I collected 120 cards in the day and a half we were there, just in our travels up and down the strip.<br/><br/>Ditching the family (who all ended up at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville for the third time) on Saturday night to wander the casinos and ultimately discover a duelling piano bar in the Paris. The duellists were fun, and wild. The tables were full at first, so we watched from the doorway. And then when seats opened up we had a good time at a cafe table for an hour, sipping cabernet, and putting in requests.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103287/#Comment_103287" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T12:33:59+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 12:33PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is making me feel like I must have been to Vegas once, even though I'm in a different continent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103309/#Comment_103309" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T13:59:04+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  1:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Being exactly drunk enough to be completely shocked by the teleporter trick.</blockquote>\nThat one got me, too.

I've only ever passed through on the way to somewhere else, so I haven't seen any of the entertainment there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103337/#Comment_103337" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T18:05:28+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  6:05PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2007 10:43PM by philaros.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>her sister's Jimmy Buffett themed wedding</blockquote>\nGah!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Ditching the family (who all ended up at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville for the third time)</blockquote>\nGAH!!!<br/><br/>Mercifully, the couple times I had to walk by the place this past weekend, they were blaring an '80s rock soundtrack rather than Buffet.<br/><br/>The memory I always like to relate is similar to MikeRM's, and it's of my first view of Vegas. When my friend Jason moved to L.A. in 2000, I went with him for the drive as far as Vegas. Crossing the border of Arizona, just past the city on the border, you can see a bright glow on the horizon, which is Vegas, 140 miles away. After a while, you can make out a distinct white beam stretching straight up from the midst of the glow: that's the light on top of the Luxor, still 100 miles off*. Finally, there's a point where you're clearly up in foothills above the city, but you still haven't seen it, and suddenly you round a curve and spread out below you as far as you can see is a vast valley full of golden lights, and that is Vegas.<br/><br/>A memory from this weekend: stumbling out of the Excalibur in a daze at 1:30 in the morning, having just spent the last hour and a half walking about 4 miles from Treasure Island down to Mandalay Bay and back, and realizing that the good-looking woman off to the side who is calling and waving is in fact trying to get my attention, and is probably a prostitute (although not dressed particularly slutty).<br/><br/>Another memory: discovering to my delight that while the casino and hotel exterior of the Aladdin has been converted to its new Planet Hollywood theme, most of the mall is still the colorful "Desert Passage" theme rather than the cold, stark and soulless "Miracle Mile" theme they're changing it to. Vegas is always changing and soon all traces of the Aladdin will be gone, but I'll always have the memory and the photos I took of what it was like.<br/><br/>*Edit: apparently the border town of Mesquite, NV, on I-15, is only 90 miles at most from the Luxor. But still, you can distinguish the Luxor's beam amidst the general Vegas glow at that distance. I expect to be roundly mocked by Harper for correcting my own story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103352/#Comment_103352" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T19:46:44+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  7:46PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, now I do want to visit Vegas.

Dragging a woman nearly topless through the Riveria because she was too warm to keep her shirt closed but her bra was still on and no one thinking anything of it. <br/>6.  Being so drunk upon waking up that my breakfast order included bacon, eggs, toast and a Mai Tai!<br/>7.  Winning $160 on a $1 craps table and having only walked up with $20.<br/>8.  In the same day having the hotdog special for $1.50 at the Westward Ho and then having a $100 steak at Circus Circus.<br/>9.  Two-fers!  Oh the mighty two-fer.  You can do pretty much anything in Vegas... two for the price of one. <br/>10.  Being able to carry your drinks on the street, and even leave your glass on the curb.  It WILL get picked up. <br/>11.
