It should not be forced on the players.</blockquote>\nIn the other transcripts they mentioned that you could even use different rules, session to session, based on what was best for that game's theme. So if you know next week we will be playing out a giant chase... use the chase module rules. If you know next session will be all political intrigue... use the right tool for the right job. One size does not fit all, which is why they are going for a modular design.<br/><br/><br/><b>How Indie Games Are Perceived:</b><br/><br/>Friends who worked for Wizards of the Coast and Paizo used to call games like The Mountain Witch and Dogs in the Vineyard... <b>Scenario Rules</b>. A focused rule set designed primarily to tell a specific story. They said: <br/><br/><i>"These games would be like us taking the adventures / scenarios / modules we sell for D&amp;D and including a trimmed down focused rule set with it to capture that story's specific style. That's not what we do because D&amp;D is a toolkit for the DM to customize to tell any story."</i> <br/><br/>A different D&amp;D freelancer friend said: <br/><br/><i>"That's another reason why people say these games take power away from the DM, not just because some of these games give you narrative control, but the designers are telling the DMs to use these specific rules where we say do whatever you want. We know these rules need to be changed to tell specific stories but we let the DM do that for us since they know their players better than we do."</i><br/><br/>And yet another different D&amp;D freelancer friend said: <br/><br/><i>"This is why D&amp;D 4E is called an indie game. It tells you how to play. Many of us know that the rules are better than they have ever been design wise but that's not the point. Look at Iron Heroes designed by Mike Mearls. The same people who loved that game, a game which was similar to 4E in many ways, hated 4E. Why? They actually like the rules in many cases. But they don't want to be told this is the way to play. These games are about people. They are about friends. And you don't know my friends better than I do."</i><br/><br/>My feelings on all this doesn't matter. This is how they feel and I appreciate how it honesty gets to the core of why they feel the way they do. I think it's real, devoid of agenda, and refreshing in how self aware the comments are. <br/><br/><br/><b>What Do We Do With This Information?</b><br/><br/>- D&amp;D 5E will support Modules. <br/><br/>- Modules can introduced custom rules to tell specific stories, emulate specific fiction, explore specific themes, or evoke specific emotions.<br/><br/>- Even if Modules aren't presented this way, I don't see why they can't be used this way. <br/><br/>- Focused games like Kagematsu already do this. What if there was a Kagematsu Module to turn a session of D&amp;D into a session of Kagematsu?<br/><br/>- And if D&amp;D 5E comes with a Third Party Licensing agreement that's not as generous as the OGL but not as restrictive as the GSL, you can publish these Modules independently. You wouldn't be a freelancer working for Wizards. You would be selling your Indie Games the way you always have. These Modules would still be Indie (licensing details pending). <br/><br/>- Depending on the licensing agreements, you could even build a connection back to your own game. So the D&amp;D Kagematsu Module could come with a copy of Kagematsu or information like "if you enjoyed this Module and want more like it, check out..."<br/><br/>- My hope is that this would all be a way to both introduce Focused Rules while encouraging DM/Player choice. I do agree with the comments above that for many people, D&amp;D is about friends. And it's useful to have informed options to choose what's right for your specific group.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356576/#Comment_356576" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T12:47:31+00:00" title="January 29, 2012 12:47PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm skeptical. D&amp;D is and will remain the fantasy adventure game. I don't see it ever addressing any sort of narrative agenda in a substantial manner. Except of course if some third party takes just the new 5E Basic game (ie. "Ability Scores + Race + Class + d20 and nothing else"), and then bolts on a whole new set of procedures and mechanics. But is that still D&amp;D? I don't think so. I expect 5E will provide decent support of dream games, because the modularity will offer a chance to ignore lots of rules, opening up space for asserting the group's creative vision. But fundamentally D&amp;D will be what it has always been.<br/><br/>The Iron Heroes comment is absolutely true in my opinion. The most vocal and fervent supporters of Pathfinder are playing a game that's looking more and more like 4E, design wise, yet flames burn. It's <i>all</i> a matter of presentation. Anything I can do with my character in 4E I can do in 3.x, too. 4E made the mistake of being "naked design". It's all there, apparent, on the surface. 4E bungled up from a marketing standpoint in the beginning and then by explicitly calling out broken forms of play in previous editions.<br/><br/>Of course all the 4E naysayers were all "that was never a problem in my games" because they houseruled or rather player around it in the first place, and refused to see it as a systemic problem.<br/><br/>This is why the earliest/Basic editions of D&amp;D are at the forefront of the OSR resurgence and the most popular right after the currently supported editions - because their rules are so sparse and minimal that they constitute and extremely focused core of a system is then all socially developed in-group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356635/#Comment_356635" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T17:49:58+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  5:49PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "In the future, all restaurants are Taco Bell."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356636/#Comment_356636" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T17:52:12+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  5:52PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2012 5:53PM by J_Walton.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny that people think 4E failed (i.e. to find the following they hoped) because it was too focused.  That might be part of it, but the largest part seems to be that it wasn't consistently fun to play, at least by the rules in the original corebooks, which had a host of issues (skill challenges, damage/hitpoints, etc. etc.), and because none of the early adventures published for it were very good.  Maybe it got better later on, with Essentials and what not, but by then it was WAY too late to regain the audience.<br/><br/>As for what 5E means for indie game designers, it really depends on if the core of the game is well-designed and consistently fun, yeah?  If the core is solid, then sure, I can see a lot of indie folks writing more focused or carefully tailored scenarios for D&amp;D.  And WOTC has shown -- especially with the Castle Ravenloft boardgame -- that they can boil modern D&amp;D down to a core experience that's really solid and compelling.  But we also have evidence that just because WOTC releases one product that really gets it, those ideas don't necessarily spread through the company or come through in other products.  Gamma World had some good ideas but mostly it was incredibly tedious to play and showed very little of the genius of Ravenloft. Like Gregor says, part of what people love about the OSR is the super basic core experience that works consistently every time, and that's exactly what they should be shooting for with 5E, even if the core experience they have in mind is different.<br/><br/>So, really, while a lot of what they're saying about 5E could potentially be very cool, it ultimately all comes down to the execution and how well the core gameplay succeeds.  If the core of the game is great, all things are possible; if the core of the game is lousy, no amount of tweaking and adaptation will be able to save it, and everyone will keep playing OSR, Pathfinder, Dungeon World, or whatever else.<br/><br/>I mean, everything that WOTC's saying about 5E is already possible with Dungeon World, right?  I just get Sage &amp; Adam's permission to release a DW module that uses a bunch of variant rules and, boom, done.  I mean, it'd kinda be weird (or maybe even impossible) to release a DW module that doesn't use variant rules, since creating those might just be part of how you create a DW module.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356637/#Comment_356637" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T17:52:17+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  5:52PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2012 5:57PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There will be no effect!<br/><br/>(This is always my prediction.

When I was first getting into new-school gaming, I spent a year or two tacking things onto D&amp;D 3rd edition (like Clinton Nixon's <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/sweet20/" rel="nofollow">Sweet20</a> rules), and the results were always clunky and blah.<br/><br/>Maybe there's a way to make it work and make it fun.

People have been rather loudly clamoring for a return to a more OGL-style open license, and going as far as to say the lack of such was one of the factors in 4E's failure. (I'm more than a little skeptical, given the glut of d20 crap and the way all of the d20/OGL products that have had any staying power have been separate games rather than D&amp;D material.) For "indie" in the publishing sense I expect if there's a more open license we'll see a major boom in third-party releases, though I also expect consumers will once again have to be careful if they want stuff that's actually good.<br/><br/>There's also the question of how digital tools will figure into all of this. One Bad Egg was putting out some really great stuff for 4E, but it just didn't sell enough, and they cited the inability to get stuff into the Character Builder as one of the major reasons why. If 5E doesn't make the CB so overwhelmingly attractive, or makes it possible to load user-created content, it probably won't be so much of a burden to third-party publishers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356665/#Comment_356665" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T22:38:46+00:00" title="January 29, 2012 10:38PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2012 10:40PM by Captain_Thark.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm kind of astonished, D&amp;D; 5 has gone from my prediction of utter failure to basically the 'Fixed D&amp;D;' hack I've toyed with for a while now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's got:<br/>\n*Slow attack advancement so you can use almost any enemy at any time.<br/>\n*Skills that act as occasional mods to ability scores.<br/>\n*Ability scores as saves<br/>\n*At will powers for wizards so they don't have to use crossbows.<br/>\n*Support for heavy exploration.<br/>\n*No assumption of magic items<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, if it has HP that doesn't inflate or increases but slowly, and the spell list is only about a dozen spells long, I'll be convinced they've been spying on my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Read further.

I can talk about it more if you'd like in whispers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356753/#Comment_356753" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T11:49:47+00:00" title="January 30, 2012 11:49AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah yeah, I totally get what you mean now.

"Say yes" and "character themes" have been around for a while but the way he implements them likely relies more on the knowledge he's picked up from a diversity of sources and not just from D&amp;D. For example, the DMG says, "say yes" but then a lot of the material people use to learn how to play D&amp;D doesn't support this or show you how in any consistently deep way. The advice exists in the various DMGs, it's just not as formalized in a clear procedural way as you might expect. But this may change in 5E. <br><br>That said, "say yes", "say no", and "listen to the story" does seem to be a major part of Monte's DM toolkit, so I wouldn't be surprised if more and more of the mechanics follow along. <br/><br/>And of course... modules will change everything!

Maybe there will actually be some improvement, even if it is coached in "this isn't the only way to play, make up whatever rules you like, this is just helpful advice . . ."<br/><br/>Is that just wishful thinking? I hope not, because I think D&amp;D, since it seems to be the biggest intro point into RPGs for new players, could really USE some good instructions aimed at telling new GMs how to run a good game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357378/#Comment_357378" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T13:32:46+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  1:32PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2012 1:32PM by Hans_c-o.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>This conversation is frustrating because there's a whole 'nother conversation to be had between the people who have actually read/played these rules, of whom I know there are some around here (not just Dave).

I think they suggest an obvious course of action for D&amp;D: give the DM as much support as possible for tailoring the rules to their group.  Pretty much every problem I've ever encountered with any edition of D&amp;D boiled down to some judgment call the DM made in a vacuum about how the game ought to go.  D&amp;D has never offered a process and a usable interface for such decisions.  <br/><br/>At this very moment, my first-time Pathfinder GM is tripping over himself trying to meld encounter variety, uber-plot, character development, puzzles, fights, and advancement.  He's resorting to time travel and random moments of railroading, and each time I make a suggestion on a more elegant alternative, he's like, "Oh, huh, I never thought of that."<br/><br/>If D&amp;D5 can solve <i>that</i> problem, awesome.  If not, I imagine the game will be prone to a lot of the gripes folks have with previous editions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357798/#Comment_357798" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T16:46:57+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  4:46PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2012 5:06PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the course of action for indies, I wonder what would happen if you slapped a D&amp;D logo on Mountain Witch and assigned XP values to the various outcomes, so folks could play it and then have something to show for it in their ongoing D&amp;D game. I have no idea what that would do for sales and quality of play, but it'd be interesting to find out. <br/><br/>Honestly, most of the scenario-like indie games I can think of demand that you play a character who's probably nothing at all like your D&amp;D character, so I don't think integration is generally feasible. If someone wanted to design an indie game <i>specifically</i> for D&amp;D compatibility, I'm sure they <i>could</i>, but I think most indie inspirations are coming from some place other than "what an adventuring party might do".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357851/#Comment_357851" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T07:02:20+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  7:02AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2012 7:06AM by jenskot.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>What bugs me about the way the game is being talked about is that lines are being drawn without any game text to be had and only vague NDA-blinded blog posts and WOTC blog posts that are courting old schoolers while trying to somehow assure 4e folks that they aren't going to be left out in the cold.<br/><br/>The language being used to describe the game is flat-out annoying.<br/><br/>Here's<a href="http://critical-hits.com/2012/02/03/initial-impressions-of-the-new-dd/" rel="nofollow">an example</a>:<br/><br/>"Two of the groups I had both went into the Caves of Chaos with very typical 4e empowerment.

Oy.</blockquote>\nIn the case of Mike Shea, who's quoted above (who is brilliant, I've seen him DM and he's a machine) I think there are a few additional things going on:<br/><br/>- D&amp;D 4E has burned out quite a few DMs, especially who were DMing high level adventures.<br/><br/>- Mike Shea has a story where his high level group killed the 30th level Orcus with almost no effort. <br/><br/>- In 4E, the number of conditions players can inflict on solo monsters has become infamous. The thing that can eat worlds is dominated, slowed, dazed, and repeatedly knocked on its 30th level behind while the PCs slap it around. The perception (not fact because there isn't enough data) is that 4E DMs eventually give up on drama and roleplaying because nothing ends up mattering (at least in terms of challenge). Some of these DMs (not Mike Shea above) are people who worked on 4E and are working on 5E. <br/><br/>- As a consequence, I think you're seeing burned out DMs clamoring for a different experience. To the point that 5E (by default as modules theoretically will customize the experience) may swing completely in a different direction (from the play reports and seminar transcripts we are seeing). Simple example: we're going from 4E characters almost automatically having any basic equipment (treasure was designed so almost any mundane item was trivial to buy) to needing to scrounge for anything that they can get their hands on. We're going from characters loaded with magical gear to magic gear being extremely rare. <br/><br/>Full disclosure. I still like 4E (specifically Essentials) but I've been one of these DMs running high level adventures thinking, "what's the point." Here is an extensive data driven study that underlines these issues: <a href="http://theiddm.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/power-options-status-effects-mutual-assured-destruction/" rel="nofollow">http://theiddm.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/power-options-status-effects-mutual-assured-destruction/</a> (it's been since show that these study is actually an understatement and the issues are far worse than shown).<br/><br/>That all said, the focus should be on a fun game. What we're seeing is very reactionary. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>There are other, far worse examples of folks starting to make this game about a refutation of Forge principles or WoTC admitting that some side was right all along.</blockquote>\nThe problem with the belief that 4E itself failed is three fold:<br/><br/>One, it failed because it didn't meet Hasbro's expectations, which any other RPG company would have been very happy with. Still a relative failure but it is important to remember that context. <br/><br/>Two, it failed because it might (stress might, I don't know) not have been profitable or very profitable but not because of 4E itself, but due to software development costs tangential to 4E. <br/><br/>Three, it failed because of business decisions and marketing, unrelated directly to the core system. They drove Paizo and Old School fans away because of business decisions. Killing Dragon magazine, killing the OGL, killing PDFs, talking ill of past editions and a very long list of other problematic decisions. 4E was surrounded by poor communication with fans. 4E isn't coming out, wait it is. 4E isn't an MMO, wait that was part of the explicit design goals. We're playtesting 4E extensively, wait we're ignoring the majority of the playtest feedback. <br/><br/>That all said, I do think the focused approach to D&amp;D pushed away older fans. Saying, D&amp;D is about combat, you have to use a battle grid, and we'll design the system so you 99% can't play without minis and tactics clashed with the desires of many existing fans. But 4E became an incredibly easy game for new people to learn, run, and play. I've seen more younger folks play 4E than I ever saw playing 3E. But the growth found attracting new players was overshadowed by the loss of old players. Was that all because of the focused approach? No. I believe this approach is being scapegoated to a certain extent. And I think it is easier to point to focus and less options as the problem rather than the harder to discuss or admit issues I described above. Is it a problem? I think so. Was it the biggest problems. I don't think so.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>When a game comes out, I don't root for it to have indie RPG's bits in it.

A lot of it sounds like the opposite of what I'm into. And there are rumored to be over 60,000 DDI 4E subscribers. Not insignificant to say the least. And we're hearing more and more people wondering if they should cancel their subscriptions. <br/><br/>How many fans subscribe to Paizo products? I would guess, not more than DDI subscribers. Probably less but I really don't know. <br/><br/>How many fans actively follow the OSR? From what little I've seen, it's about the size of the Forge / Story Game scene. Which is much smaller than either existing 4E fans or Pathfinder fans.<br/><br/>Wizards needs to be careful that in trying to expand their audience, they don't lose their existing fans. So far a lot of the focus seems to be on the OSR at the expense of existing 4E fans, which purely number wise... is bizarre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357880/#Comment_357880" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T11:08:58+00:00" title="February  5, 2012 11:08AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, as I'm sure we're all aware, even rather mediocre rules can rock with a solid foundation of technique and shared expectations.
