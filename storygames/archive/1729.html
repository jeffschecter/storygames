                    So we played Misery Bubblegum this wednesday (as we often do!) and we used the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1675&amp;page=1#Item_54" rel="nofollow">Chain of Contrasts</a> technique that I'd been experimenting with here on the board.  We were playing kids with unholy spirit-type monsters in a demented "pokemon" style relationship, being used by a military conspiracy to defend the world from emerging hostile gods.  Eric and I had played last week with Cody and Kyle (respectively) and so we created them again for this session.  They were different, both because last week changed them and because different aspects of their personality became relevant to this week's story.  Here's how the contrasts worked out:<br/><br/>Tony (as GM, and therefore multiple characters):  Kyle is withdrawn<br/>Eric:  Cody is sociable and jaded<br/>Sydney:  Victoria is enthusiastic and a little princess<br/>Tony:  Major Blake is a patriarch, and heartless<br/>Eric:  Cody is concerned and laid-back<br/>Sydney:  Victoria is compulsive and manipulative<br/>Tony:  Kyle is insightful.<br/><br/>So in-game this had an unexpected benefit:  I had (just for completeness's sake) requested that we each write down both sides of the pairs.  So I had eight attributes on an index card:  Two for Kyle, two for Major Blake, two for Cody and two for Victoria.  When Sydney started trying to play a little princess and Eric was playing Cody as concerned, they were hitting a wall in terms of finding contrast.  I looked at the index card and said to myself "Oh shit!  Major Blake <i>isn't in this scene</i>.  We totally need to switch scenes to include Major Blake."  Framed a new scene, and the same conversation played out much more smoothly.<br/><br/>Cool tool.  It meant that we got much more broad coverage of people's issues, because when something had been languishing we framed our next scene to highlight it.  This also had some consequences for pacing.<br/><br/>For instance, we had a <i>crazy</i> high-conflict scene where, because Victoria was futzing with her luggage rather than attending to the transfer of her monster, the carnivorous unicorn broke loose and started killing staff.  Sydney was all about Victoria calming it down because she's such a beautiful little precious girl, and I was all "Screw that noise.  Kyle's got a creature made of the fused spirit-matter of damned souls ... time to throw down, pony-boy," and there was flaying and screaming and all that jazz.<br/><br/>But right <i>after</i> that conflict, we looked and knew that (a) we needed time to ramp up other conflicts and (b) the whole sociable/withdrawn thing on Cody and Kyle hadn't had enough play.  So we framed a scene on the beach, and I said "and Kyle is there," which was sort of touching even to start with ... withdrawn, pale kid still goes out to the beach, because that's where Cody is and Cody is his friend.  And they talked about where their duty lay, and what life was about, and the scene ended with a shot of Cody helping Kyle practice getting balanced on a surf-board in shallow water.  Because Cody's a good guy, and Kyle needs to open up.  They're good for each other.<br/><br/>There was some conflict in that scene, but it was hugely different.  It was a conflict about whether they could overcome their differences.  It was cool.<br/><br/>So, long story short, I think this contrast-chain thing has some legs.<br/><br/>I have a question though:  In the current rules system, when someone makes a contrast to Kyle being withdrawn, I put one of my dice on his withdrawn trait.  That's a little clumsy though:  I'll act withdrawn, then I'll have to sort of sit and wait until I see if someone contrasts.  It gets me in a wierd attitude of trying to solicit people, but not being able to reward them.  It's asking for their charity.<br/><br/>Now I wonder what would happen if, when someone contrasts with my attributes, I give <b>them</b> one of my dice?  This is still also a reward for me (the dynamics of the system are such that giving away your dice actually benefits both you and the recipient), but it fosters a very different focus of player attention.  You're doing your thing (Kyle is all withdrawn) because you are seeking a reward from them (for contrasting with their character) and also because it will prompt them to behave in a certain way (Cody is sociable) in order to seek a reward from you.  I wonder if that would have a more natural flow, without the little speed-bumps of "Uh ... is someone going to act in a certain way so that I can move the die I want to move to the place on my character I want to move it?"                </div>
