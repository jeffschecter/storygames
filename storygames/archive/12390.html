I was wondering if people who have the Drifter's Escape, and have read it, could send me some comments (taogames@gmail.com) about the stories, which might kickstart him into writing more. Save your comments about the game (that's my part), just the stories, thanks.<br/><br/>It would mean a lot to both him and me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
