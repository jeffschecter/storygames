One of his directions to me was \u201cStart at zero and end at zero.\u201d Really have no idea where the scene is going to take you.</i><br/><br/>When I was playing <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13161&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> today, I realized that I was trying to keep my mind blank of ideas between scenes that I was directing (as a player). In the past, I would tend to fade in and out mentally of other peoples' scenes as I was scheming about what I wanted my character to do when it was "my chance".<br/><br/>But this has definitely started fading for me. Although it's still a stretch for me, I try to really live in the moment and spend energy paying close attention to the other scenes and thinking about things to incorporate or help with there. That means that when it's my scene I don't have anything in mind, and sometimes have a few seconds of "hmm...what to do?" But I also find that it keeps me fresh and I don't overthink things.<br/><br/>What do you do at the table? Plan ahead? Or wing it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296466/#Comment_296466" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T02:52:46+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  2:52AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, that sounds very zen-like. Blanking your mind.<br/><br/>It depends on the game. Like, for instance...<br/>- A Taste for Murder: I usually plan the side scenes a bit; how to navigate the fiction &amp; blatantly manipulate the players so that I can get the black or white die, and try to win. Doesn't always work, though.<br/>- Society of Dreamers: No plan whatsoever.<br/>- Apocalypse World: A little bit, but I find it works just as well without, as long as I have my fronts and threats prepared.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
