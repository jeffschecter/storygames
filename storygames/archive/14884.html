I envisioned a green leather-grain vinyl mat covering the table, with spaces marked in paint like those on a roulette layout. Persistent Aspects of the genre, setting, and campaign might be marked in paint near the middle, but scene aspects would be written on plaques in dry-erase marker and placed in spaces on the layout. Each player would have an area on the layout with spaces for plaque that indicated his character Aspects, current Tags, and current Consequences. Compels and tags would be indicated by laying chips on the layout as in roulette.<br/><br/>Okay, so that is wildly extravagant and probably impractical. But maybe a layout could be produced using laminated printout, or a table topped with glass or a dry-erase surface.<br/><br/>If we were making a FATE layout, what features and organisation would suit it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb" title="AusJeb"><img alt="AusJeb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb">AusJeb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338379/#Comment_338379" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T06:23:31+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  6:23AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Agemegos</cite>Compels and tags would be indicated by laying chips on the layout as in roulette.</blockquote>\nI agree that this seems overly elaborate, complex, and time-consuming.

And then see about making one out of paper or light card and giving it a protective covering of acetate film, or laminating it. And if I ever get one general enough to bear repeated use, I suppose I could get vinyl from an upholsterer and do a bit of careful work with a paintbrush, masking tape, and enamel paint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340101/#Comment_340101" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T20:27:56+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  8:27PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Draft objects are ready for playtesting next Friday night.<br/><br/>The central part of the layout is a "workboard" with a dry-erase surface, 453 mm by 601mm (about 18" by 24"). This has been through the wars: the other side has a meticulously-ruled 25 mm hexagonal grid drawn on it with paint-marker. The new side has a three wide by six deep grid of rectangular spaces ruled on it with a permanent marker, and the columns headed "Setting", "Campaign", "Scene". The spaces are slightly wider and deeper than a standard 3" by 5" index card. I have written persistent Aspects of my setting and campaign into spaces in the appropriate columns using dry-erase markers. Each one is lettered twice so as to be readable from either side of the table. Scene Aspects may be written into the spaces in the appropriate column and wiped off when the scene is done, but I plan to letter some index cards with Aspects that I expect to use often, which can be set out in the "Scene" column to save the time of writing legibly. Perhaps I will colour-code the cards, using buff for lighting conditions, red for footing and surface conditions, green for people present etc.<br/><br/>I plan to put the workboard in the middle of the table when we play, with a poker chip pre-loaded on each Aspect in play. When a character-player takes the free first tag of a persistent Aspect we will remove the corresponding chip to stock. Thus there will be a constant visual reminder of Aspects in play and what free tags are available, which will (I hope) encourage the use of those mechanics.<br/><br/>The other part of the layout is a character placemat for each player. This is sort of like a character sheet, but it is designed so that the character's name, language list, and Aspects may be read from the other side of the table, for the convenience of players (including GMs) who might need to address a character, compel an Aspect, or refer to whether a character can understand what might be said. If you print out the placemat at 71% size it will fit onto an A4 landscape page it has about as much space and about the same-sized type as a character sheet, and the circle marked "Fate" is large enough to put a stack of poker chips in it. But the mat is intended to be printed on an A3 landscape page. When this is done it is possible to write the character's name and Aspect large enough that they can be read across the table by a middle-aged man who doesn't quite need bifocals yet. More to the point, the boxes provided for Aspects will be large enough to play a poker chip in one.<br/><br/>During playtesting I'll simply print the mats out, write permanent features of the characters on them in pen, and use soft pencils for checks and consequences. But when I have thrashed out the bugs and am happy with the layout I will get a set of blank A3 mats laminated. Fixed characteristics can be written on with a permanent marker (it is erasable with solvent) and transient ones with dry-erase.<br/><br/>My hope for these mats is that players will be able to use them to indicate gameplay using tokens and gestures, with minimal intrusion into the narrative. For example, any player might indicate a <i>Compel</i> by taking one of his chips and placing it on the relevant aspect. The player of the character affected can either take the chip into his stock to indicate accepting, or put a chip from his stock on it to indicate refusing. A player might indicate an <i>Invoke</i> by taking a chip from his stock and placing it on the relevant Aspect on his own character placemat. Perhaps a player could indicate an <i>Accidental Compel</i> by tapping a forefinger or a chip on the Aspect that is being Compelled.<br/><br/>I might need spaces somewhere on the table for "power a Stunt" and "Bonus +1" chip discards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340104/#Comment_340104" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T20:52:40+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  8:52PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2011 6:38PM by Agemegos.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone cared to cast an eye over the character-player placemat and give me advice on it, he or she could <a href="http://wabcag.wikidot.com/fate" rel="nofollow">download it as an 77 kB PDF</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340198/#Comment_340198" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-23T13:33:57+00:00" title="August 23, 2011  1:33PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The link goes to a GURPS Space star system generator rather than the FATE placemat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340248/#Comment_340248" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-23T18:41:37+00:00" title="August 23, 2011  6:41PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry about that.
