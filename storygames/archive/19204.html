It's a good system, easy to learn, easy to teach, easy to play, easy to hack.<br/>My only quibble is that there is a paucity of example adversaries and magical items, but that is balanced out by the quick-and-easy adventure generator and dungeon generator, as well as ample examples of traps.<br/>The magic system is also a plus. It has a good balance of combat-oriented and non-combat-oriented spells, all of which are pretty darned useful.<br/>The one thing I always hack though is the Development Points (a.k.a. Experience Points) and Morality. The way you earn DP is great if you have players that are invested in the story...not so good when they're a bunch of people whose only experience with RPGs is World of Warcraft. Same thing with Morality, good if you like story, not so good when you're just killing things.<br/><br/>Haven't read all the way through Covert Ops yet, but I like a lot of what they're doing with it so far. Hopefully when spring rolls around, I'll be running a GI Joe-ish game of Covert Ops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
