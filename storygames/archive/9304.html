Now that's a sentence and a half. Holy moly.<br/><br/>So if you'll forgive the term "traditional" for a moment, it seems that most traditional games approach the design problem as one of "derived effects". That is, you start by thinking, in the context of the game's scope, "How would I model...an ambush?". And so, starting with this event that you want present in the game, you then analyze it and decide what its criteria might be ("An ambush occurs when a hidden unit has been inactive for at least one full turn and is adjacent to an enemy unit during the enemy unit's move.") Then you derive effects ("The ambushed unit must immediately halt. The ambushing unit gains +2 on all attacks and forces a morale check.") Obvious!<br/><br/>Now, designing with Fate it works backwards. Most of Fate is based around asking the question, "What effects can you have?". The answers are mostly things like:<br/>* get +2<br/>* force inaction (a compel)<br/>* damage a stress track<br/>...and are bought and paid for with a currency.<br/><br/>And so, you instead have to derive the events -- you need to explain why compelling "carefully felled trees" halts the enemy in place, and why free-tagging "been watching this spot for hours" is worth +2, and so on and so on.<br/><br/>That is, the player has been forced into the traditional game designer's role throughout actual play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
