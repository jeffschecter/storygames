The first level character has just enough ability to rise them up above the average commoner to face relatively small-scale challenges, and as they level up, they can defeat stronger foes.<br/><br/>But what if we started even earlier than that? What if the game begins when the heroes were still in their nascency? <br/><br/>Obviously, the risk here is that the PCs will be so weak that even simple monsters can be dangerous, and a mundane threat can become an epic undertaking. But I consider this to be a feature rather than a bug. The \u201clevel zero\u201d party needs to pick their battles more carefully. They still keenly feel their mortality, so they are hesitant to fight without both a very good reason and a plan. <br/><br/>But more importantly, when starting at level zero, the roleplay focus is by necessity on the personalities of the characters themselves, rather than revolving around the schtick of a particular class. The characters are defined by their experiences more so than by an arbitrarily chosen role. This ultimately results in characters who will have a deeper connection to the world and each other, and have a more organic growth rather than coming freshly formed from the mind of a player who may be thinking rules-first.<br/><br/>Provided they survive, of course.<br/><br/><br/>For Dungeon World, I\u2019m currently overhauling the Villager playbook written by Jason Morningstar and Marshall Miller for an earlier version. This is not intended to be a \u201cfunnel\u201d; the villagers should ideally survive, though they may have to cut a deal with Death at some point. I\u2019ve added a few weak advances that can be used to simulate character growth and differentiate each other. I\u2019ve also put greater emphasis on Bonds. In my ideal game, there would be three times to write Bonds: just before play begins properly, at a mid-way pinchpoint, and at the end.<br/><br/>Aside from the in-game advantages listed above, I hope that this approach will mesh nicely with Dungeon World\u2019s focus on quick world-building as well as provide an easy introduction to the basic rules and moves. I think that this could serve as both a one-shot as well as a prelude chapter to a bigger game, with the added benefit of getting the players playing as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>I still need to pick some commoner-sounding names\u2026 I think that limiting them to only two syllables would be a nice touch. Does anyone have knowledge of dwarven or elvish phonemes?<br/><br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrcWNQR1BKNVktVFk/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrcWNQR1BKNVktVFk/view?usp=sharing</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442337/#Comment_442337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-31T23:51:25+00:00" title="January 31, 2015 11:51PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm confused.

Likewise, while I'm not adverse to characters dying, I think that if that does happen, it should be a meaningful death. Funnels carry with them the implication that the characters are inherently disposable, and I don't find that style of play enjoyable. I feel that this runs contrary to the principle of "be a fan of the PCs".<br/><br/><br/>I\u2019ve deliberately omitted the \u201cLast Breath\u201d move from the Villager sheet. Adventures should be dangerous, but at the same time, dying in what is intended to be a prelude isn\u2019t fun. The balance between making the characters feel like they are in danger and actually killing them is a very fine line to walk.<br/><br/>It\u2019s certainly likely that the characters will have a brush with Death at some point, but at this stage you can be lenient. If they get medical attention immediately after being dropped to zero HP, they should live, though they\u2019ll be laid up for a good long while and bear a scar from it. However, if they are left dying for any length of time, even less than a minute, they should get a visit from Death. Have him offer them a bargain. That way, if they do die, at least it was their choice, and not because of a string of bad luck. Offering to let them live just long enough to finish their immediate goal before dying is another option.<br/><br/>The characters shouldn\u2019t feel like they lose when they run out of HP, but the cost of their victory should go up by a noticeable amount. Of course, if everyone dies during the adventure, well\u2026 that happens too. It just wasn\u2019t meant to be.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X" title="Charlie_X"><img alt="Charlie_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/513/nSBLNVCY6RNQO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X">Charlie_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442344/#Comment_442344" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-01T13:17:10+00:00" title="February  1, 2015  1:17PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this idea.

In fact, we're not usually content to settle for just level 0...we want a good portion of the game to be focused on this type of low-power, common man play. When we redid the D&amp;D system we upped it to the first full block of 6 levels, and adjusted a LOT of mechanics to adjust to it as the baseline. Other games we expanded low power play in other ways. It's by far the most fun for us. So I guess what I'm getting at is, bravo, and best of luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
