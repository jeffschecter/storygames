Post-Gamestorm convention, I want to know what worked, what did you struggle with, and what was missing?<br/><br/>We're continuing from <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=369885" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, where we discussed the physical play space. The topic now is: <b>How did the game scheduling work for you?</b><br/><br/>We had games running in Room Birch and the Upper Lobby surrounding Birch. We also had a Demo Table in the dealer Hall but it didn't get used much. We had a few games running in different areas of the con: Children's Programming and Larp.<br/><br/>I scheduled games according to preset time blocks, with hour breaks in between:<br/><br/>Morning 10am - 1pm<br/>Afternoon 2pm - 6pm<br/>Evening 7pm - Midnight<br/><br/>All the games were slotted into these times, with some variations: a 3 hour game might start at 2, and wrap up early at 5. Or a 2 hour game in the morning slot would start at 11. Or extremely short games could be run back to back within the larger slot. There were a few games that ran over the break hours. either because the facilitator wanted that particular hour or there was no other time when its room was available, namely Sea Dracula.<br/><br/>We also ran a few panels--one per day--that were all slotted into the morning block.<br/><br/>We facilitated gaming at the start of each block with A) a whiteboard for posting games both official and unofficial to recruit players, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> an "Open Story Gaming" circle where enthusiastic facilitators gathered everyone seeking games GPNW-style, ran over ground rules, pitched games and split off into groups to play. We had many, many games running at once in most Open Circles, I daresay more than the scheduled games.<br/><br/>So, what worked, what did you struggle with, and what was missing? Did the Open Gaming Circles run smoothly and succeed in including everyone who wanted to play a game?  Was there some arrangement you found yourself wishing for?<br/><br/>How effective was the scheduling system to use? Were you able to submit the games you wanted to run, as well as sign up for games you wanted to play? Any major hiccups or frustrations?<br/><br/>Were you able to find the games you wanted to play, scheduled or otherwise? What could've been clearer?<br/><br/><b>I know everyone's really busy and excited for Game Chef, but there's a Gamestorm committee meeting this weekend to give feedback on how the con went, so your timely data will be valuable!</b><br/><br/>(next topic: cross-department games!)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS.

However, <b>I liked the uniformity of the Open Gaming Slots</b>. It meant that I could get in the rhythm of each and it was easy to refer people. <br/><br/>I thought the Open Gaming Circles went down pretty satisfactorily. We pitched a bunch of games, then hemmed and hawed, but I\u2019m certain that at the end everyone had a game to play. By the end, I was telling people to go ahead and sit down and that we would fill in empty seats with late comers and I was never proven a liar. It was <b>chaotic as expected, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m glad we always had four hours to play and a one hour break</b>. The <b>hardest part of the Open Gaming Circles was getting everyone signed in</b>. I don\u2019t know the solution to that. <br/><br/>The whiteboard didn't get used by everyone during the Open Gaming Circles, but I noticed that games that were on the whiteboard had more interest in them. A little advertising before the pitch never hurt. <br/><br/>I thought it was easy to find the games I was scheduled to play. <br/><br/>Very off topic: The one thing I found myself wishing for was a printer. I would have paid outrageous prices to be able to print up extra sheets for games I forget to prep ahead of time. Maybe next year the indie booth could have a printer that could charge a few bucks for those must-have character sheets?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372136/#Comment_372136" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T11:31:41+00:00" title="April 10, 2012 11:31AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My post got eaten.<br/><br/>I liked them, the blocks.

If I'm signed up to run a game and have 4 players signed up, I'm cool and don't pitch at the pick-up donut or whatever.  But then 2-3 of my players don't show and I'm left trying to find other players or something to play after the donut is over.  I apparently accidentally destroyed one of Brendan's Monsterhearts games in this fashion, when a player in my game was intending to leave early and then forgot, leaving Brendan with not enough players.<br/><br/>I don't have a solution to that problem, but it's definitely a thing, when everything follows the same convention slots.  People adapted and it was fine, though, so there may not be an ideal solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372183/#Comment_372183" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T13:42:28+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  1:42PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2012 1:43PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also like the shorter and longer slots.<br/><br/>My only little point of critique is that the three players who had signed up for Anima Prime almost walked away because our table was smack in the middle of the donut action and they were pretty confused about what was going on. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  But it all worked out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372196/#Comment_372196" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T14:22:48+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  2:22PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the donut / open gaming intro could also stand to be shorter and clearer.

That way, nobody's put in the position of aspiring to speak for all the games and GMs that are participating.  For example, there were times when the way Open Gaming was presented as a whole was misleading in terms of describing the game that I was preparing to run. If people want to present their own games in whatever way they like, that's cool. But if I'm running Dungeon World, having it described as a collaborative storytelling exercise doesn't really help and may in fact alienate the kinds of players I want to engage with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372241/#Comment_372241" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T17:34:07+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  5:34PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's go really deep on what the best Spiel for next year will be.

I need the momentum from 7pm to carry me through to Midnight.<br/><br/>Another angle on that: I didn't really expect most evening games to go till Midnight...the slot just means that the space is available TILL midnight.<br/><br/>And a FURTHER, ADDITIONAL angle on that, is that we had plenty of smaller games fitting into the slots like legos: so like an HGMO game for an hour, then Baloidham demo for an hour,m then Penny for two. And so on. So if someone runs a 2 hour game at 7, and someone else a 3 hour game at 9, that's a-ok!
