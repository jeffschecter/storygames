Please check it out.<br/><br/>Jadepunk is a combination of the wuxia and steampunk genres. It's set in a fictional world where, in place of natural resources like oil or the ingredients to make gunpowder, they have mystical jade that acts as their source for technological advances.<br/><br/>The link: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2027490713/jadepunk-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2027490713/jadepunk-roleplaying-game</a><br/><br/>If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420632/#Comment_420632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T16:41:52+00:00" title="August 23, 2013  4:41PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ryan. Good luck with your campaign! <br/><br/>I see references to both "Triad members" and an "evil Jade Shogun," which makes me wonder if there's a mixture of different Asian cultures and traditions going on, and whether that's intentional or has been more haphazard. What's been your approach to the treatment of Asian elements in this game? <br/><br/>As a totally seperate question, what aspects of wuxia are you drawing on?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420633/#Comment_420633" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T17:14:36+00:00" title="August 23, 2013  5:14PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2013 5:19PM by RyanDanks.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the well wishes!<br/><br/>The wuxia themes used in Jadepunk follow the themes in wuxia fiction (fighting against oppressive tyrants, wandering the world righting wrongs, societies of martial artists having a subculture within the larger society, etc.). The Jadetech devices allow for the supernatural martial arts (jade swords, armor, tattoos...) but supernatural martial arts is certainly a possibility. We are going to put it in the book as an option, but the overall concept is that Jadetech is the vehicle for supernatural ability.<br/><br/>The question of culture is a bit involved. Short version: no, it is not haphazard. There has been a ton of writing involved in bringing everything together, and nothing was thrown in "just because." We only added something when we saw a need for it, or where it was specifically requested.<br/><br/>The long version:<br/><br/>We have taken a very methodical approach to the cultural inclusion in the game. It all started when a Filipino friend and I (stated for clarity that this isn't two white guys in a vacuum) were discussing the similarities between the gunslinger and knight errant's unwritten codes of honor and the code of Xia, which is what the wuxia genre follows. (Both my friend and I have over 20 years of experience and study on martial arts and its historical roots, so we have a lot of these sorts of conversations.)<br/><br/>This discussion gave me an idea: a setting where traveling gunslingers interacted with the wuxia community. At first it was meant to be a basis for fiction, but then I started throwing in steampunk and got to work on the game setting, which is set in a fictional world, entirely different from ours.<br/><br/>But we needed an antagonist. There had to be a threat that everyone could fight against. Up rose the Western Trading Company (modeled after the real world, and reportedly corrupt, East India Trading Company). That brought in the South Islanders (modeled after the Pacific Island nations), which are branded as pirates by the Western Trading Company because they refused to let the Westerners to trade in their islands, and have gone to war over it.<br/><br/>But that wasn't enough, the South Islanders took the emphasis off of Kausao City, which is where we wanted to keep it. So, we threw in the Steel Empire (created with Korean and Japanese influences). The Steel Empire are hardened warriors and settlers, living in the harshest areas of their continent. One of their rulers, known as the Steel Shogun, desired to improve upon his personal living conditions (not caring about his people) by conquering Kausao City, which has the largest jade deposits in the world. Few of his citizens agreed with his decision, but he had divine decree on his side, and the hardened military was too willing to go to war. He joined with the WTC and quickly took Kausao as his own, renaming his nation the Jade Empire, and his station the Jade Shogun.<br/><br/>Twenty years later, our story begins. A rebellion has risen up against the Jade Shogun and his Bushi warriors. Benevolent people from all nations, including the former Steel Empire, wishes to repel the Jade Shogun and restore things to their natural order.<br/><br/>So, Kausao City is a melting pot, similar to the real world Hong Kong, New York or London.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time and interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_420918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/fenryo" title="fenryo (Banned)"><img alt="fenryo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fenryo">fenryo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420918/#Comment_420918" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-31T07:16:31+00:00" title="August 31, 2013  7:16AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your pitch and potential, wish you good luck                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420924/#Comment_420924" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-31T09:26:25+00:00" title="August 31, 2013  9:26AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks! <br/><br/>We've received a lot of feedback in the last week, so we're going to release updated setting information on Monday.
