                    So, even though it's been months and months since I last played Exalted, and I don't have forty bucks to drop on a game that takes a lot of prep time, I still started reading through 2nd Edition in the bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Shit!  It has Keys!  And Relationships!<br/>
<br/>
Or rather "Motivations" and "Intimacies".  Motivations are the replacement for the Nature mechanic - for those not in the know, it was WW's standard characterization enforcement thing, that (in my opinion) suffered from 1) actually being half of a mechanic (nature/demeanor) that only really fit in Vampire.  2) being too vauge, and  3)having to be chosen from a list.  Motivations are epic, specific, and player authored.  Intimacies only really matter in the social combat system, apparently, but it's still awesome just that they're in there.  I think the book said, "The important thing is to be able to say 'My character loves his sword, his horse, and his country.'"  Coolness.  Now if only it was connected to the experience engine, instead of Willpower.<br/>
<br/>
It also seems like the book really expects you to be doing epic stuff.  Skimming the Charm trees (kool p0werz), I noticed that they took all the boring ones out, put them at the begining of the chapter and said "here, take one of these first, then have your fun".  So all the crazy cool shit that you couldn't do unless you min/maxed your character or played for three months is now the second or third thing in each tree.  They have rules for army vs army stuff too.  The game is supporting what it claims to support.<br/>
<br/>
So now all I need is time and money.                </div>

<br/>
It's $23 and free shipping on orders over $25, so you need to throw in some electronics item or other that you've been meaning to buy for a while (DVD-Rs? USB key? Another book or game?). It's definitely worth $23. If you end up playing it, that is.<br/>

                            Thanks for the link, Andy.  Now I'll actually have to think about it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
What really interests me about this is that it has a lot of these elemets like social conflict mechanics, relationship mechanics, and explicit flags, that have been associated with "indie" games.  And Exalted is a very popular "mainstream" game.  I'm glad they're pushing for new mechanics that serve their goals, and I hope it's successful.  My cynicism can't make up its mind between "of course they won't buy it, it isn't just the same old thing with a new binding" and "of course they'll buy it, nothing can stop rampant consumerism".                        </div>

<em>Now if only it was connected to the experience engine, instead of Willpower.</em><br/><br/>Why's it have to be XP, Dan?  Willpower is a hugely important credibility resource throughout Exalted.  You could argue that it is in fact more important than XP.                        </div>

                            Good point, especially because getting bigger traits isn't really that big a part of the game anyway.  I'd like it if experience was more than "show up", though.                        </div>

                            Hi Dan,<br/><br/>First, it's important to note Intimacies actually do nothing in terms of reward:<br/><br/><i>Normally, Intimacies don't mean all that much.  Serving them does not gain the character Willpower or Essence, for example.  Instead they are a way to protect certaian things the character care sabout from socially adept characters ... while providing those same socialites with handles they can use to manipulate the character.... Only really worry about these in a very social game." </i> - pg. 90<br/><br/>And, Motivation only scores back a single Willpower point for a whole scene acting on it, normally.  You can get more points by a) sleeping, b) stunting, or c) limit breaking.  So in this sense, players are more rewarded to have their Exalted either rest or freak out in action, with the motivation being merely sprinkles of reward to the action sundae they're encouraging.<br/><br/>The experience system appears to be designed with the specific idea of not letting the different characters grow too far apart in abilities in the group rather than any actual reward in mind.   Basically, the awesomest roleplayer and the wallflower should only see a difference in rewards after 20-30 sessions of play... and even then, it's going to amount to a couple of extra powers, and that's it.<br/><br/>My overall feeling is that these ideas were designed after <i>hearing</i> about how a lot of input mechanics work for indie games, but not actually playing them and seeing what it is that they really do...                        </div>

                            Bankuei-  Yeah, I suppose you're right.  The person responsible for the character sheet didn't event leave space to right them.  This isn't any kind of great leap for mankind or anything, but I'm still surprised that those mechanics are there at all.  If I was playing it, I'd probably homebrew it so that sleeping didn't  count and Motivations and Intimacies mattered more.  And stunts too.  The first edition made a big deal out of those, but they didn't affect your chances of success much.  So, yeah, still far from perfect, but I appreciate the (attempted) improvement.<br/>

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>They make it mechanically difficult and unrewarding to persuade someone against their Motivations/Intimacies. An extra cannot spend Willpower to resist persuasion except if his Motivation runs against the commend, for instance; so it says, "use this character to do anything <em>but this."</em> Intimacies similarly provide added defence against persuasive attacks. Charms turn these defences into even profounder defences.</p>
<p>So, they're a player tool for saying, "I will not allow this."</p>

                            Hi Dan,<br/><br/>I mentioned this to Shreyas, but basically the mechanics look like someone read a bunch of rpg.net threads, saw the words, "Kickers", "Spiritual Attributes" and "Beliefs" kept showing up, thought it would sell well to make something similar, and tried to make something that would work the same way without actually seeing the original mechanics or trying them in play...<br/><br/>The fact is, several games with good flag mechanics and input options have been out for about 5 years now... so, to not have done a servicable job at this point is pretty lame. <br/><br/>These aren't anything like Keys or Relationships, they're more like a set of Feats that give you +2 vs. social attacks on that specific Intimacy...                        </div>

Ross-  It looked like it was very well put together, but I'm not sure it's the kind of game I want to play.  I tend to like less crunchy systems that have mechanics specifically designed for drama (like Shadow of Yesterday).  That said, I'm still interested.

<p>That has me wondering...</p>
<p>Exalted's setting is a non-setting, I think. It's subtextually saying, "Look, if you embed things into the situation's history a bit then you can totally fly off the handle and no one will bat an eye. It also helps if you draw on a little Asian fetishisation." There's really nothing else you need from it.</p>
<p>Then there are Exalted's rules, which you, Sempiternity, Dan, you don't seem to want.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> it about the book that you need, since there isn't a setting and you don't want the rules?</p>

                            Good point.<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing is that i see a "core" of good setting - at least in the way i think of setting, which i believe is different from your conception - that can be extracted from the Exalted materials and built off of in play, using other elements of the canon, or not, as it goes. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, i don't need the book to do that...<br/>
<br/>
I only became interested in Exalted after i realized that if i combined two ideas i was working on for game setting (in my terms) that i would basically have Exalted's setting, and thought it might be best to skip the extra work of filling it out enough to play (in the old mode i'm still working within) on my own, and just copy paste from what White Wolf already wrote...                        </div>

<p>I think we like what we want the book to be.  I like the ideas.  There are these things in the system, stunts, motivations, intimacies, virtues, that I like the idea of, but I don't think are implemented very well.  The idea of a cruchy combat system where you apply your cruchy character creation (charms) has some appeal to me too.  So if I played it, I'd probably use those, but recreate the reward system in my own image, so to speak.  I guess I'm really just saying I want to make a fantasy heartbreaker.  Hmm...</p>

<p>I feel like it should not be hard to restructure the reward system to be more, eh, <em>rewarding</em> for Motivation~Intimacy~flipping-out-focused play.</p>
<p>The way I see it, it's deliberately, conservatively designed so that you can ignore that subsystem. As a result, the subsystem lacks backbone. I'll think about this for a while; I love heartbreaking Exalted.</p>

                            One of the easiest ways to flip that is to simply hack in TSOY's Keys for gaining xp by dealing with Motivation and  Intimacies.  1 point for dealing with it, 2 if it's a hassle, 5 points if you deal with it while Limit Breaking... (yes, odds are you'll be destroying relationships or people while doing so, everyone loves drama).<br/><br/>This results in really fast character growth (which I like) but you may want to tweak that.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I was disappointed with Exalted's half-assed attempt at doing some neat mechanical support of character choices and relationships and their somewhat unimaginative social combat system.  Once I get a few hours, I hope to gut all that and redo it in a more post-TSoY fashion.  I agree with Chris, it seems like they heard about all this neat stuff, and read about it some, but didn't really bother to connect in into the rest of their mechanics (it feels tacked on), so players are probably just gonna ignore most of it.<br/><br/>But yeah, Motivations and Intimacies and the Social Combat stuff all has the <i>potential</i> to be really cool, but it's not quite there yet.                        </div>

                            So, to survey the things I like that I think are at least implied in Exalted.<br/>
<br/>
You'll have to choose between Motivation (epic thing you were exalted for) and Intimacies (your mortal identity).  Often.<br/>
<br/>
A Motivation is like a Key, but you only have one, and it can be more specific.  For example:  'I will stop the oppression and manpulation of the people at the hands of petty gods.' is a Key, while 'I will kill Venus' is a Motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to chime in.  I'll have more later.                        </div>

                            If you see Exalted for what it is, then there is no need to be disappointed.<br/><br/>It's not an Indy game trying to appeal to mainstream,<br/><br/>It's a full-on mainstream game that gives a slight curt nod to small games.<br/><br/>It works fine for what it is, of course you want more indie influence, but this is not what the game tries to do, and thus shouldn't be a factor for when you judge the game, merely the "curt nod".                        </div>

<p>Here's an easy modification that'll bite up social combat a bit:</p>
<p>Clinch-analogue. (See physical combat rules.) When 'clinched,' you have imposed a new Motivation on your target(s). A character can only support as many Motivations as his max(Temperance,Essence). The rest get pushed down into a stack, submerged by more recent Motivations. (This allows monastic religious types and heroes to have complicated motivations, while still dominating mortals efficiently.)</p>
<p>A social "crush" is a normal social attack performed while clinched. Social dodge is impossible. Basically, the idea here is that you impose a Motivation compatible to your goal, and then issue orders that align with that Motivation.</p>
<p>Charm interfaces for this include mucking with the Motivation stack and messing with the reward structures for Motivations; consider a Motivation reward like "get (2*Essence) motes each turn you act directly for your Motivation" or "get motes when you ignore danger because of your Motivation" or "get motes when you abandon opportunities to work for your M." and so on...</p>

                            A bit of an aside, here, but can someone tell me how Charms works in broad terms? I'm pretty Exalted ignorant. Can you employ more than one Charm at a time? Is there any "activation" cost of any kind? Is there a broad explanation of what they do (for example, grant more successes or something, though I realize they probably have many and various effects).                        </div>

<p>Matt,</p>
<p>All Charms are extensions of a numerically-rated Trait. Depending on your magical heritage, it might be an Ability, an Attribute, or a Virtue, or something else.</p>
<p>Generally a Charm either permanently improves your effectiveness in some way (one class of Charms provides extra Health Levels), or you spend resources to activate it and improve your effectiveness temporarily. The resources available are Willpower, Health Levels, and the most frequently-used one, motes of Essence, which are a fairly small unit. Most characters have a maximum reserve around 30+. Motes of Essence replenish very rapidly.</p>
<p>In the new edition, there is a general template for Charms that provide more dice or successes, but the bulk of any heritage's Charms section is Trait-specific Charms with special, specific, rule-breaking effects. (For instance, in Ride there is a Charm that gives your mount the ability to fly and the confidence to do so.)</p>

                            Charms are the kewl powerz of Exalted.  Often they cost "Essence" which is the power points resource of the game, and occassionally they may cost Willpower as well, which is a much more limited resource.  A few Charms are just "always on" and cost nothing at all once you possess them.  <br/><br/>There's several categories of Charms, which determines whether you can activate them only on your action, or in reaction defensively etc.  Basically, think of how Magic the Gathering has "Instants/Interrupts/etc." and Exalted has an equivalent.  <br/><br/>You're only supposed to be allowed to activate one charm until your next action, but you can also use "Combos" that let you activate any number of them -in- the combo .  (and yes, there's rules for what can go in a Combo, what can't etc.)<br/><br/>Effectively, the tactical decisions of Exalted are about the resource management of Essence, Willpower, and timing/use of Charms.                        </div>
