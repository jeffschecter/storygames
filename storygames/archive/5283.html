If that much is required, I probably won't play it or pick it up. I like cheet sheets, but those are usually available in a GM screen or PDF format. I often can't be arsed to make my own if its more than what I can give verbally.<br/><br/>For Nobilis, I simply print up the "No You're EnNobled?" pdfs and handed those out.  That was enough.<br/><br/>For Exalted, all I find I have to do is give a basic premise of the setting - only a little more detailed than "You're demigods who are out to change the world" and talk a little bit about the brief history, types of Exalts, potential antagonists, and the potential of magic and weird setting elements.<br/><br/>I'm more and more drawn towards games with light settings, specficially stuff that is informed and influenced by the players, so there's less and less I need to fill them in on before hand.<br/><br/>If I need more than that to run the game, I'll convert it or, again, just not run it. Like for Exalted, the charms are just too much book keeping.  But it's fairly easy to convert to HeroQuest, so that's what I did.  For Wild Talents or Spirit of the Century, there are a lot of rules options for combat that I don't remember, but the systems are simple enough that I can wing it based on what's going on and look up the rule to remember later if I want a more official version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119007/#Comment_119007" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T13:13:28+00:00" title="January 10, 2008  1:13PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I started law school and had to outline things like crazy, I did a lot of this.

Then my sales pitch is already online and ready for when we next start a new game. I also do some if I expect the game to be a hard sell. Another huge reason is the language barrier. I post my selling points in both Swedish and English. While my players all speak English, they are much more comfortable with Swedish, and having translated some of the basic concepts and terms from the game is a very good prep exercise for actually playing the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119140/#Comment_119140" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T10:51:55+00:00" title="January 11, 2008 10:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2008 10:53AM by David Artman.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We certainly use the Dogs cheat sheet in play. I have also compiled my own cheat sheets with photocopies at Kinkos, cut-and-pasted up and re-copied (in particular, for Hero and for Warhammer FRPG). Going further back, every Hero System campaign I have started has made extensive use of the campaign Design Sheet, which lets one mark out Powers or limit how they're bought so that you get the desired "feel" for the setting without having to negotiate every single player-made power. That summary also made makes it REALLY easy for a newer player, because they only had a subset of the Hero System to "grok."<br/><br/>But I never do what I thought you meant when I read the thread title: "translate" game terms into other terms that may or may not be as evocative. I think that just leads to longer learning time, as one must grok the game in these "familiar" terms and then do it all over again with the "specialty" terms the game text actually uses. It also kicks referencing the game text in the nuts, because only those who know the "translation key" can reference the rule text thought its Table of Contents or Index.<br/><br/>Now, on a more general level, I'd certainly associate game system elements, to speed teaching (ex: "OK, Coins are used almost like Dice Pools"). But it's pretty rare with my regular (ha! as if!) game group that I could do a lot of cross-game associations with "indie" games, because of their lack of exposure (i.e. none--buncha conservatives trying to relive the 1980s with games that never deliver).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
