That means no kids please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>F2</cite>Suggestion: If kids above carrying/toddling age (5-14 yrs?) participate in Nerdly, have a designated track of games/activities for them, with designated (volunteer?) adults willing to supervise. (Adult areas = ADULT AREAS). Maybe Fred Wolke could do the kids' program/supervision, since its important to him? NOT a personal attack on Fred W. - he could be good at it &amp; might feel more included.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>F3</cite>I love Camp Nerdly, but I wish it was either only for adults, or kids had their own space and were not allowed to play any of the adult games.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>F4</cite>I'd like the adult-only area to be more enforceable. I would like to suggest that either young toddlers or older (16+) kids be preferred. Grade school and tweenies not be preferred. </blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>F5</cite>I was very dissapointed by the lack of enforcement of _adult-only_ space. This was supposed to be (I thought) a grown-up vacation, but often I felt like the presence of children intruded on my play-space. If they could have their own kid-only activities that would help end the friction of younger kids always trying to intrude on adult games. Even if the parent gives them permission, I don't feel it is fair to those adults trying to run &amp;/or enjoy their games. I am not trying to be anti-kid, but their presence made me uncomfortable and it didn't seem like the right kind of event to bring kids to. I would _very much_ prefer this be an age 16+ event (or higher).</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67059/#Comment_67059" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T06:04:46+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  6:04AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Jason said:\n<blockquote><br/>The major item that people actually complained about was the child policy and, extrapolating, the behavior of children who attended.

I didn't feel like the children were misbehaving, I just wish the adults only space had been more securely adults only.<br/><br/>I liked the communal vibe of this nerdly, where there was more than just gaming going on even though that was the driving force and energy of the event.  I kind of worry that making kids a no-no is one way to start losing that vibe.<br/><br/>To boot, I like the idea of Nerdly being a 'safe' place for people to expose their children to the gaming community, not just a convention of gamers in the woods, if that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67065/#Comment_67065" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T06:19:28+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  6:19AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I may offer a parenting tip from my very limited arsenal:  Orienting yourself around what kids should NOT DO will make you feel like an ogre and make the kids come across as brats (no matter how well behaved).  Orienting yourself around what kids should do will make you feel generous and happy, and make the kids come across as romping little chaos angels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem at Nerdly, it strikes me, is that there is absolutely <i>nothing</i> that kids are supposed to go and do ... and many, many things that they are supposed to Not Do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if we want it to be a family-friendly event (and I agree that I want that too), what do we the responsible adults plan to do in order to provide entertainment and fun for the kids, in a way that's fun for us as well?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67071/#Comment_67071" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T06:24:57+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  6:24AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this was magnified by the fact that there were so few children there.

Am I a "responsible adult" in your eyes?

With more, they are a part of the activities, and things are better. We can't say, "Bring more kids!" though. Another reason this was amplified was the weather, which we should plan for. A Saturday like Sunday would have meant a hike to the mine, and more outdoor activities, which are great for kids. <br><br>If Camp Nerdly keeps allowing kids, I think the solution will have to be two-fold: have more fun stuff for kids to do, but also, and importantly, make certain that parents know that they will be responsible for their kids, and if the kids are unsupervised and cause/have problems, that will be a big deal. So as not to be vague, I don't want to see kids running around with simulated weapons without a parent within 20 feet ever again.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67076/#Comment_67076" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T06:39:28+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  6:39AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was a concern after Camp Nerdly Zero, and we very specifically took steps to address it this time.

Putting me in charge of kid's activities means that I'd be having my own little convention with me and my family off in a corner somewhere, and frankly we do that with much less hassle at home.  Requiring me to be supervising my (by the time CN2 comes around) teenagers every hour of the day amounts to nearly the same thing.<br><br>I agree with Tony that the only way it will work is if people welcome the presence of the kids at their games, at least some of the time.  If that doesn't happen, then you might as well just say that it's an adults-only event.    At least some of the time that William and Anita spent in what were supposed to be adults-only spaces is that there was nothing going on that welcomed them.  Just because I'm the one who is responsible for their behavior (punishing misbehavior and rewarding good behavior) doesn't mean that everyone else can ignore them.<br><br>How about this as a partial solution:  Anyone who isn't responsible for their own actions (kids, whatever) must have the cell number of a responsible party on their nametag.  If anyone has a problem with kids behavior, you can call or text message said parent for immediate action.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67079/#Comment_67079" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T06:47:51+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  6:47AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason:  I wasn't trying to contrast "responsible adults" vs. "irresponsible adults."  I was trying to contrast "responsible adults" vs. "kids."  Your question strikes me a little strangely as a consequence, and makes me worry that you read a point into my phrasing that I didn't intend:  I was mainly saying that it is (in my opinion) <b>more than okay</b> for the adults to be telling the kids what to do and when to do it, in a way that would be stifling and annoying if we did the same thing adult-to-adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I think it would be totally fine to say "Okay, Victoria, this is the game kids are playing right now.  You can play this, or you can color owlbears in the craft-corner, and those are your only options.  No, you may not wander freely.  You have to stay here where Mr. Alexander can keep an eye on you."<br/>\n<br/>\nClinton:  I agree that the answer is not "Bring more kids!" as a marketing scheme.  It's one of those situations where if you build it, they will come.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn some levels, the easiest way to bootstrap such a thing into existence is to offer a good kids track, even knowing that all the energy you spend on preparing it may go completely to waste.

Kids-only <i>Jungle Speed</i> would be radically more fair than having them join in cut-throat adult games.  <i>The Big Night</i> is a roleplaying game that has gotten tremendous play for kids at GenCon, and could do equally well here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody should get these things together, organize a few interested parties, define a track and ... oh God, you people are going to expect me to do this now, aren't you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67085/#Comment_67085" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T07:03:38+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  7:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's good to start thinking up potential solutions.

I guess my question for you, Tony, is who bears the burden of organizing and running such a track? If the parents, then we refer to Fred's comment above, where he (rightly, I think) points out that it then becomes him and his family off by themselves, with no other gaming for him.

You meant the former, all is well.  And I absolutely told Anita and William what to do, on several occasions.  But I'm not uncomfortable around them, and I know their parents, and I was Boss Nerd, so that hardly counts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67089/#Comment_67089" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T07:08:49+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  7:08AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really think the problem, at least as I saw it, was not that I had a problem with the kids being there. I rather enjoyed talking with them.  The problem, once again as I saw it, was that there was an area (just one) labeled clearly as adults only.  Yet when it was mentioned to the parents to please take their children out of the area, they did not.  That I found rather annoying.  Not a personal attack on Fred, but come on.  Please follow the rules.  <br><br>I think having activities for the kids is a great idea!  But, but, it's a gaming camp, thus the kids should be able to game.  I don't think making a place for them and them alone is a good idea.  That would:<br><br>a. Give someone the job of watching the kids and this ain't a day care camp.<br>b.  Exclude the kids from potentially gaming with adults which is the whole point of Nerdly.<br><br>I have no problem watching my tongue in the Mess Hall and would gladly include anyone that wanted to play games with me, or learn to knit, or what have you.  But in the Castle, I'm going to scream and swear and talk about man rape.  That's just the fact of it because it's the adult area.  I don't want to have to worry about holding my tongue there.  It's the whole reason I went to game in the castle.  <br><br>So all I ask is, please follow the rules.  If an area says adults only, then it's adults only. <br><br>Lisa P                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67090/#Comment_67090" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T07:11:04+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  7:11AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, as a technical note, cell phone service is spotty at best in the camp.

I'm sure Orbital Platform Wolke is already doing an excellent job of this at home, but said platform came to hover over Planet Nerdly and yet it seems like very little commerce took place between the two entities (or so I'm inferring from some comments here) and what commerce did take place was troubled.<br/><br/>If we want to include kids, we need to provide concrete ways to be inclusive.  That means scheduling something for kids in every slot on the schedule -- and if we can't do so, we need to say "okay, we can't support a kids' track".  There's no real shame in that latter message if it's true (though even without shame, I am certain there would be disappointment).<br/><br/>And that's not to say that this should be done solely in a "entertain the kids" way -- by which I mean, I think we're allowed to see the presence of children as a resource rather than a draw on resources.  What if a bunch of game designers got together with the kids, found out what they liked in games, and then *designed them a game on the spot*?  I think it'd be pretty awesome if Nerdly started being a nexus for kid-friendly game designs.<br/><br/>And speaking of kid-friendly game designs, some Zorcerer of Zo or Faery's Tale games wouldn't exactly suck.  Combine those with some structured party games (ala Apples to Apples) and you're potentially off to the races.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67096/#Comment_67096" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T07:16:46+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  7:16AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2007 7:21AM by TonyLB.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>Seems like the way to handle the problem would be for me to stop coming.

Requiring me to be supervising my (by the time CN2 comes around) teenagers every hour of the day amounts to nearly the same thing.</blockquote>Fred:  You're being an alarmist, and I for one have no patience for it.  We are <i>one day</i> away from the event, and we're expressing concerns about bad things that <b>absolutely did happen</b> at the event.  You have just gone into ballistic over-reaction by saying that, because <i>one person</i> suggested that <i>maybe</i> you would be a kid-friendly kind of guy, we're trying to drive you away and ruin your fun.  The only thing that's going to do is to make people uncomfortable about expressing themselves, lest they aggravate your hurt feelings.<br/><br/>I am not interested in pussy-footing around the issues just because you've got a great big chip on your shoulder about ... God, I don't even know what.  Get.  Over.  It.<br/><br/>We are going to discuss these issues openly and frankly, because we are interested in making CN2 <i>better</i> than CN1.  Ideas are going to be proposed:  quite possibly some ideas that, from your perspective, are <i>obviously not going to work</i>.<br/><br/>For instance:  Your idea of text messaging an adult who might be anywhere in the camp?  That's not going to work.  That is fine for situations where the acceptable reaction gap between a problem <i>starting</i> and the problem being <i>stopped</i> clocks in at five to ten minutes.  Yeah ... if the kid is hungry, that's fine.  If the kid is running around and ignoring the safety protocols of a boffer fight then the situations needs to be resolved <i>quicker than instantly</i>.  I mean that literally:  It is not enough to react in five seconds, or even zero seconds, somebody needs to <i>anticipate</i> that problem and stop it before it even begins.  Likewise with kids walking in on Adult-Only roleplay.<br/><br/>There needs to be a system in place that does more than simply pick up the pieces after trouble happens.  A kids-track/play-pen strikes me as a good first step toward that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67098/#Comment_67098" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T07:18:58+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  7:18AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>Here's a question, and it's not rhetorical.

They hear stuff worse than that all the time.  They shock me far more often than I shock them.<br><br>They also understand the difference between make-believe and real life... better than some gamers do.<br><br/>In general... I don't know what the answer is.<br/><br/>Look...<br/><br/>A few weeks ago I took Anita to a Jonathan Coulton concert.  I hadn't listened to his entire ouvre.  I had heard "Skullcrusher Mountain" and "You're My Moon" and a bunch of other kid-friendly songs.<br/><br/>I didn't know about "First of May".<br/><br/>He played a BUNCH of songs like that... about half the show.

Hell, I'm all up for making owl bear costumes.  *big grin*  It sounds fucking awesome!  I'll teach them to knit, crochet, cross stitch, or what have you!  Gladly would.  You know what guys, sign my ass up.  I'll plan something for the kids at CN2.<br/><br/>But back to the topic at hand, when I noticed that no one was doing anything with them, yourself included, I decided to take it upon myself to chat with them, show them my cross stitching and knitting and talk with them as much as I could.  Yes, this took time away from me joining a game on more than one occasion, but I wanted them to feel included because I remember clearly being the only child at adult functions when I was a little girl and not having my mother anywhere in sight to talk to/with and it sucked!  Flat out sucked!<br/><br/>Now I'm not trying to call you a bad parent (FAR FROM IT!) but please realize that this is something that is going to happen if you just throw them to the wolves known as adult gamers and expect us to watch them.

Yes, I completely sympathize with Fred Wolke and family.

I want there to be kid oriented events and tracks, etc. If people like Fred and I cannot make it because all of Nerdly is going to be 100% adult, that would make me sad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67158/#Comment_67158" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T08:14:05+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  8:14AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>Oh, and Fred?

Many people are volunteering their time.  We can keep kids contained and busy, systematically distanced from the adult-only gaming areas, and monitored at all times ... while simultaneously giving their parents the majority of the weekend care-free to play games.<br/><br/>I think that, given that, it should be very much possible to make a Camp Nerdly that <i>some gamers</i> could come to without even realizing that there are kids present.

I think there are filaments of constructiveness in this thread. It sounds like a good beta attempt for kid support at CN2 would be:<br/><br/>- Have each child-bringing parent commit to providing a minimum of one gaming slot of entertainment for children.<br/><br/>- Ask for volunteers to fill the rest of the gaming slots with child-appropriate activities -- be it "let's make a kid-friendly RPG with kid input" or "let's play apples to apples" or "let's make owlbears out of sand and twigs".  <br/><br/>- If the kid schedule isn't filled by parents going beyond the minumum, and isn't filled by other non-parent volunteers, then kid inclusion should be taken off the table and CN2 turns into an adult-only event.  (If someone commits and then doesn't show -- which based on CN1 could happen a lot -- parents will need to pre-commit to filling the unexpected gaps themselves.  It sucks, but a lack of a fallback plan would in my view be disastrous.)<br/><br/>- Mandate a minimum "safe" age for kids (tween-plus?).  The rationale I see for this: Under a certain age, I honestly don't think kids can participate as a <i>gamer</i>, and I think it's appropriate to keep Nerdly's focus squarely (but not exclusively) on folks being gamers.  Sure, hikes and crafts and whatnot can still be a part of this, but I don't think it'd be a bad thing to make sure 51% of the kid activities are structured in a way that shares our hobby with them.<br/><br/>Again, I want to encourage an attitude where we see the kids as paticipants, and as resources unto themselves.  Kids can teach us things that adults can't.  I'd like to see if we can't create at least a subset of activities where we learn from *them* as much as they learn from *us*.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67182/#Comment_67182" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T08:33:39+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  8:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite> I think that if an interested sub-group of the convention is willing to step up, the rest of the attendees don't have to.

Owlbear costumes, frex.  Some people like this stuff.<br/>2. Block them out.<br/>3. For ALL OTHER BLOCKS parents must sign up to be the cat-herders for their share of the remaining blocks; They can run games or other activities.  Shares are allocated by family and required based on number of kids; that is, if your family has three kids then you take three shares; if you have one kid then you take one share.<br/><br/>This will mean that every block (including late night blocks for night-owl tweens and teens) there will be one place where someone has stepped up and said, "I'll watch the kids" and we can point our kids at that block and say, "That's where you need to be, unless you have some other place."  This will give parents the opportunity to have some time to play away from the kids, and some time to do their duty, shared in an equitable way.<br/><br/>For any kid who is being a problem (intruding where he doesn't belong or doing something dangerous to himself or others) there needs to be a way to handle the situation.  As much as we try to react positively to the situation (creating an environment where kids don't want to intrude on adult play and are supervised when they need it) these mechanisms aren't perfect.

It is entirely possible that I am creating that subtext myself  with no basis in what Fred actually intends.</blockquote>\n(Hi!  I'm thinking about doing a Camp Nerdly type thing in Kansas, and the subject of kids is one of my biggest concerns, seeing that I'm a father myself, and a great number of my target audience have kids.  So I thought I'd jump in here and hopefully I can add some useful input...)<br/><br/>I don't think Fred's trying to push any kind of blame onto the community...  as the parent of a six-year-old who has dealt with this kind of thing in church communities before, I see him simply stating a fact.  Though maybe a little passionately due to his frustration.<br/><br/>If there is no formal structure allowing him to drop his kids off in a kid-safe environment, meaning he's expected to escort his kids through the entire event, and that means he's not going to have fun, then there's not a lot of point to his coming.  It's just a fact of having kids... if no one else is willing to commit to being responsible for them for a period of time, and being solely responsible for them is too much of a burden for the parent, then it's not going to work for that parent.  I'm not saying anyone has a <i>responsibility</i> to give him a hand, but I think what Fred is saying is that if nobody is <i>willing</i> to give him a hand, he can't come (or at least he can't bring his kids).  And I totally get that, because I've had the same conversation with a church council that didn't understand why I, a leader in the church, was skipping out on church events... and it was because I was spending the entire event entertaining my son in an environment that was geared toward adults, but expected parents to bring their kids.<br/><br/>I think where things failed here was a mismatch of expectations.  Now those expectations are being clarified, and it's becoming obvious that some kind of structure or clear commitments (by somebody, not necessarily organizers or the community as a whole) to helping parents are necessary for allowing kids to come.  And I see the community responding to that in a positive way, trying to be inclusive instead of exclusive.<br/><br/>I wish I'd paid attention to CN1 earlier, because I would have liked to have come.  But one of the things that ran through my mind when I started seeing that kids were allowed was, "At every hour of the day, what would my six-year-old be doing and how would that affect my freedom to do what I want to do?"  Lacking a clear vision of that, I'd leave him at home.  (My son is very creative about entertaining himself... just not so <i>wise</i> in his choices.  I'm totally seeing boffer weapon melt-down if someone doesn't tell him to take it easy. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>While for the adults,  a freeform, "I'll figure out what I want to do when I get there," thing works, it doesn't work for kids... a parent needs to be able to see, beginning to end, where they're going to need to be entirely responsible for their kids, and where there is another adult willing to take on that responsibility for a limited time.  That necessitates a lot more advance planning...  it seems to me that if you want to allow kids, there needs to be a "parent task-force" to ensure that the kid-friendly track(s) is properly organized.  Don't dump it on the primary organizers, but there does need to be someone (with parenting experience, I think) organizing it if you want parents to bring their kids <i>and</i> have a chance at having fun of their own.<br/><br/>If I can make it to CN2, and I want to, I'll volunteer to spend some time on kid-friendly activities, even if I don't bring my son.  I'll consider being involved in organizing the kid track(s) as we get closer to the next event.<br/><br/>Carl Cravens                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67207/#Comment_67207" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T09:19:42+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  9:19AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, too, would be willing to take up Eric's offer.

These don't have to be kids-only events, though. These can be regular games where kids are welcome. I've role-played with Anita and William and found them delightful and I'd be glad to have them in certain games. I wouldn't want to spend the entire weekend gaming with kids, though, not because they're children, but because they're not as good as adults at playing our games.<br/><br/>But here's a thought: If a kid can understand your game in playtest, it's probably simple enough. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/><br/>3) Being near enough to one's own children to ensure they are happy and well-behaved, while being able to do things without them.<br/><br/>I imagine a big room where kids are doing stuff at one table, probably with some kid-at-heart adults, while the parents are at a couple other tables doing their own thing. Occasionally a parent has to excuse themselves to talk to their kids. Non-parents are gaming with the parents, too, because it's not an "adult game," but it's "adult time" for the parents. <br/><br/>This is the meat of my post. Is it that hard to have an integrated space for kids and adults where the adults can be at their own table, playing with other adults, while the kids are within eyesight and earshot doing their own thing with some adult supervision?<br/><br/>I would hope that people who reserved space in the "adult only" area would consider moving to the integrated area if they felt it wouldn't harm the integrity of their play. Some games aren't fun if you have to watch your language, I understand. Some games address mature topics, yes. But if you're running D&amp;D, there's usually little reason a kid can't overhear what you're saying. <br/><br/><br/>I also wonder if the late night games could be, by default, adult-only?  After 10PM, the kids probably shouldn't be running around outside unattended. Younger kids might be asleep. <br/><br/>Just some thoughts. I'm not a parent, but I've taught and coached kids of all ages, from toddlers through high school.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67230/#Comment_67230" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T09:50:26+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  9:50AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam:  One of the things that effects that plan is that children behave differently in proximity their parents ... they orient around them, and often-times call for parent-attention (even acting out to get it) in situations that they would have handled easily if they knew that the parents weren't nearby and that they had to deal with things on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe an integrated area is possible and desirable, and I want to make sure that we're not under-planning for the complexity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67231/#Comment_67231" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T09:52:08+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  9:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite>I, too, would be willing to take up Eric's offer.

Meeting people's kids is awesome. <br><br>I do think that we need to plan more for next Nerdly as a child-friendly environment. We had lots of planning about food and lodging and who was cleaning what and who was running what game and where and when, and not nearly so much about what the children would be doing. <br/><br/>Integrated child-care planning (including the awesome ideas of running kid-specific games and workshops and crafts) is, I think, going to have to be a real part of the solution. I think we should always make sure that in each time block there is at least one dedicated to the kids (not just child okay, specifically for the kids) activity, with folks set up and prepped to make it happen. Parents and kids can sign up for these things and then have some idea of who is doing what when and where, and what degree of authority the supervisor of the event will have over their children. <br/><br/>If we plan for the children as an "oh yea, and we need something for kids maybe..." instead of "the kids are a cool part of Nerdly and just as much a part of it as chasing spiders out of the bathrooms or playing dirty games of Roach" then it isn't going to be a wonder that there are issues. If we want to have kids there, then we should make the presence of the kids a central part of the planning.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67239/#Comment_67239" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T10:03:35+00:00" title="May  7, 2007 10:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, I'll second that entire post, but the degree to which that's true is age-dependent.<br/><br/>I think we can expect my (next time) teenagers to act differently in that regard than a bona-fide child.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67240/#Comment_67240" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T10:04:16+00:00" title="May  7, 2007 10:04AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like we're in broad agreement.

We fell down for Alex and it's my biggest disappointment regarding the event.  Because it was the first NBP, we did not have an established schedule, we just played whatever whenever, which meant that Alex was often left at loose ends.  For example, on the first night when the event split up into the "I wanna play <em>Polaris!</em>" and "I wanna play <em>Dogs in the Vineyard!</em>" groups, there was nowhere for Alex to go.  Additionally, and I think this was overlooked, the lack of a schedule for the adults to look forward to meant that adults were less willing to commit to playing a game with Alex right now -- who knew what awesome game was going to just sprout into existence ten minutes after starting in on playing Monopoly?<br/><br/>I'm coming to the discussion a little late (two pages in one day, folks -- sheesh!), but having a Kid's Track be set up and blocked out or else kids could not come is an excellent idea.  Requiring parents to provide at least one timeslot worth of kid-stuff is a good idea (although it feels to me like a transitional step that could be discarded later).<br/><br/>Having a minimum kid-age seems like a good idea (although babies might be brought by adventurous parents, cause... hey, cute babies!).  Not only is there a sort of minimum age for being able to engage in these games, but narrowing the age range would make planning the kid's track easier.<br/><br/>It seems to me that there also would need to be a critical mass of kids, too.  We need at least four kids registered or else no kids can come at all.  Now, this might be ameliorated by making the "Kid's Track" something that adults can and would be interested in playing in (playing <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, for instance), but it seems to me that assembling a Kid's Track and then getting one or two kids to go through that track will feel like wasted effort and will probably make the kids feel like they're being excluded from "the fun stuff."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67244/#Comment_67244" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T10:06:44+00:00" title="May  7, 2007 10:06AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once you have a certain minimum of kids, they become easier to handle.

This is, in my opinion, wrongheaded and not a little bit patronizing of the kids.  If there are a diversity of events available, each with various age ranges -- some of which are just for kids, some of which are for kids + adults, some of which are for just adults -- that would be way better for everyone.  That means, then, planning for a diverse body of activities for a diverse body of people.  This year, it sounds like, people mainly planned for themselves and people like them, which is totally cool, but something that we could do better at next time, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank" title="Frank"><img alt="Frank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank">Frank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67320/#Comment_67320" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T11:17:52+00:00" title="May  7, 2007 11:17AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>If we want the Nerdlies to be about kids and about getting kids into gaming, we shouldn't just provide for them, we should<em>recruit</em>them.</blockquote>\nI know I'm generally a bit of a curmudgeon, but Camp Nerdly is not about getting kids into gaming, and I never thought it was. I don't know where that idea came from.<br/><br/>I thought it was about a bunch of gamers (of any age, whatever) going into the woods and <i>playing games</i>. I know this is a fault of mine, but I'm personally not quite comfortable playing an RPG (sharing an imaginative space, I guess) with children.

I did not want to go and just hope that kid-friendly gaming would happen. I'd suggest a Kid Czar for next time, to co-ordinate Kid Track volunteers and make sure there's (at least) one active event  - hike, kid's make/learn boffing, jungle-speed tornament - and one passive event - kid-run RPGs, kid-friendly RPGs run by grown-ups, make an owlbear mask - for each session slot. Also, an ample supply of paper and crayons. I'll sign on to do a kid-slot and we'll bring our three kids (who by then will be 11.5, 8, and 2.5), if a Kid Czar and kid track flesh out. Something easy to do would be a weekend long game of Town, which can take as many kids and as many ages as you've got, and a great big piece of paper on which to make the Town.<br/><br/>For deffinition purposes, for me "kid" = walking/talking (so around 3) to 14.

Fred actually has more time under his belt by far with children than I, so, again, I hope that my conclusions aren't just hot air.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, there's a very good reason that Frank and Jason and others, and even myself, do not want to play RPGs with youngsters. Because we're not youngsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to lean to much on Ron here, but in the Infamous Five one particular principle of social interaction emerged in particular. That one should play RPGs with those with whom they would socialize in other ways. Fred, would you expect that Jason would want to go out to a movie with your children? Or go out to dinner with them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen why would you expect that he'd want to play with them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere RPGs go beyond being just tactical games, they are about the transmission of meaning between the participants. It's not just that Jason would be uncomfortable with having a scene in which a Nazi guard rapes a Polish girl... but that he'd have to worry that the child in question would think that he, perhaps, condones rape. With an adult he has the expectation that they are complex enough creatures to understand that, in fact, the rape scene is a condemnation of rape. Or there to look at some other very subtle issue that's not even something we can state clearly outside of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's something for adults to discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is not to say that people shouldn't play with children.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut one feels no trouble playing with their children because, in fact, one does have a social connection to them, as a parent. It's just that nobody else has this relationship to these people. Sans that relationship, it's unreasonable to expect anyone to want to play with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, that's actually overstating the case. If, in fact, the kids get to know the other player as "Uncle Jason," then there might be the connection that allows there to be the impetus to play. Note that the confering of the honorific "aunt" or "uncle" on a non-family member is perhaps far more important than some people realize. It says that the member should be treated for most intents and purposes as family.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, does this mean that Jason in this case is now the friend of your children? No. No more than you, Fred, are your children's friend. I'm pretty sure, knowing you, that you've not fallen into that trap. And I would hope that Jason would not as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, these are sophisticated youngsters. Adolescents, even. You would say, "When I was their age, we had rape in our RPG play." I know that my game did (though for awful reasons). But between youngsters, this is just peer testing, and getting to know the water. It's not the same as what we do when we play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, should Jason play with your kids? Yes, sure... but if so, if he gets to be Uncle Jason, then he should play as you should (and I believe do), with your kids. Meaning that you do so in a parent/child manner. Meaning that at all times the relationship is not one of peers, but one that is both pedagogical and, more importanly, a matter of being in the position of teaching moral values.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, between adults, we play to say, "This is how I feel about this value proposition... what do you think?" When we play with children, we should play to say, "This is how I feel about this value... don't you think that you ought to as well?"<br/>\n<br/>\nKids, children, youngsters, toddlers, adolescents... it all amounts to "non-adults." Adult, in this context, means "no longer sombody that we have the responsibility to teach, but who's opinions on value matters we respect." Until we can look at somebody, and know that they are an adult, playing with them is simply not the same thing. Should not be.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to put too fine a point on it, we're NOT playing games here. Just because a historical artifact leaves the term "games" in the phrase role-playing games, doesn't mean that they're the same sort of activity as playing baseball. It's all too easy for we adults to forget that we're adults, and act like kids with respect to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's one other form of relationship that's functional with kids. I'll get to that below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of you non-parents are cute. You want to have the kids do "crafts," make owlbear costumes, and have them play games about fairies. When I was playing D&amp;D; as a youngster, I thought that the Wizard of Oz was crap, because it was all singing and dancing. I wanted to kill things, and listen to AC/DC. My son Alex went to school yesterday for costume day as "Tacky The Penguin" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tacky-Penguin-Sandpiper-Books-Lester/dp/0395562333" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Tacky-Penguin-Sandpiper-Books-Lester/dp/0395562333</a>). He got home afterwards and declared himself too embarassed to put on the costume ever again. He's outgrowing "kid stuff."<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention that he's six years old? He'll be in first grade next year. I shall watch soon with pride as he graduates from Senior Kindergarten.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night he stole out of bed to play Breath of Fire III on the ol' Playstation. He plays Lord of the Rings on his Gameboy, and worries about whether or not when playing Aragorn he should take two swords, or a sword and shield. When playing Warhammer Fantasy (I made the mistake of laying it on my bed where he could see it), he's not satisfied until he's aquired a lot of EXP from killing lots of baddies. And when I read the color descriptions from the book about kills (akin to the Rolemaster crit charts), he crows with delight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe's seen my copy LotR trillogy on DVD about twice as much as I have. When he plays with his friend Josh, they play Lightsabres with the big plastic swords, and try not to hit each other too hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nEr... what I'm saying is that, if you want to make an entertaining game for kids... don't pansy it down. Put another way, if you want kids to be engaged, think of what would have engaged you at that age. It's OK to give them cool stuff to do. They want to do the same stuff that the adults are doing...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, to the extent that they understand it, that is. They want to BE adults, you see.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here's the thing. If you want to run a "Kids Track" game, there's another sort of relationship you can establish with a child on the fly. Just like we can establish short-term relationships at conventions that allow for RPGs to be played fairly successfully between adults, we can form a short-term age-appropriate relationship with kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's as "Day Care Person/Teacher." In that role, you are the authority, and, moreover, again, the child is not there to judge your values, but for you to teach them. Oh, it doesn't have to be heavy-handed preaching. It can be presenting them with tough moral dilemmas, and then telling the parent the response afterwards so that the parent can discuss it with their child. Or complex problem-solving. Just so long as you're not asking the child to participate in an open dialog on values between the two of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, it's not nearly as fun as playing with adults. It feels more like work. That's not to say it's non-fun. But just to put it in perspective. If you're playing with kids and your main motive is to be entertained by it, I think you're out of line. The welfare of the kid should be your primary motivator.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the first thing I wanted to comment upon. I have another, weirder, idea that I'll pitch below.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67533/#Comment_67533" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T07:40:20+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  7:40AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, BTW, corollary to the above... where the game is just a game... like D&amp;D; minis or something... you can just be an organizer for the activity.

The age range between 4 and 16 incorporates one hell of a lot of change. Kids change drastically year on year, and becoem interested (and lose interest) in different things. It is very very very difficult to come up with something that will work just as well for kids of eight as it will for kids of fourteen, and woe bedtide anyone who attempts to treat them the same.<br><br>So when I see "kid's Track" I find myself thinking "that really needs to be, like "4-8 Years Track" and "9-12 Years Track" and "Teenage Track" ". Even then I'd worry I was lumping together too much. And then I think, there aren't nearly enough people there to fit those categories to make them worthwhile, which makes me think the whole enterprise will struggle horribly with trying to accommodate with a bunch of disparately aged children with one activity.<br><br>It is difficult. Adults are, comparatively, much easier - people of 25 can ggenerally get along doing the same roleplaying as people of 45.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67566/#Comment_67566" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T10:08:58+00:00" title="May  8, 2007 10:08AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We could always ask some youngsters what <i>they'd</i> like to do.

I really like the idea of one of Fred's kids running a game.  I think that would be awesome!  <br><br>We do know for a fact who would potentially be bringing kids right?  Well, why not send something like that out now?  Or at least talk to the parents.  For example, all the kids that were supposed to be coming... what were their ages?  Meserach is right, there is a huge gap in what is considered fun depending upon the age of the child.  I think, if we know ahead of time, the ages of potential kids coming, that will give us ideas of things to do.  For example, if we know there are 5 kids in the younger than 10 range, hells yeah, owlbear costumes are on!  If all the young uns coming are in the tween and teen years, then making sure they get into games is probably better there.  <br><br>Just my opinion.

Parents and teachers will have various techniques that they employ. I'm no expert on educational methods, just a parent. The point is not that I'm advocating any specific teaching technique, but that the relationship between child and parent remain just that in play. For non-parent adults, the relationship should be something like teacher to child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think there's a substantive difference between an "open dialog" in a classroom, and what I do with my social peers when I game.

Lots of people have that kind of issue; I have my own biases.  I have a lot of trouble interacting with people whose drive for learning is not as strong as mine.  I don't think I'd enjoy gaming with them much.<br><br>I've gamed outside my age range many times.  I did it when I was a teen (playing DnD with parents and other relatives because they were the only ones available at first) and I have done it as an adult.  It's a different kind of awesome, but you have to have, as you say, a bit of the teacher in you.<br/><br/>Thinking back to my very bad experience gaming at college gaming con last year, I realize that my problem was trying to interact with them as peers; These kids were young enough to be my children and I was not taking the generation gap into account.  Just because they were almost old enough to be MY kids' parents doesn't make them my peers and I have to come to terms with that, much as it pains me.<br/><br/>There's a particular kind of wonder associated with playing RPG's at the age of twelve.  Going back for a taste of that at twenty-five or thirty-five or forty-five, even if only vicariously, is not necessarily a bad thing.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67882/#Comment_67882" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T10:43:05+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 10:43AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we're in complete agreement, Fred.
