Green wants to kill Red.  Red wants to kill Blue.  Blue wants to kill Green.  Which dice are compared to which?<br/><br/>2.  Green wants to kill Yellow.  Red wants to help (with Trust) Green kill Yellow.  Blue wants to kill Red.  Again, how do the dice stack up?<br/><br/>3.  Green wants to kill Yellow.  Red wants to kill Green.  Blue wants to defend Green.  Red compares dice with Blue (at least, that's how I understand it); on a success who can Red chose to give a wound to?<br/><br/><br/>We had 5 players so situations where there were cross-motivations came up a few times and I never really felt like we had a solid solution to it.  In our game it wasn't usually "wants to kill," more often intents like "I'm trying to badger a confession out of the oni in the middle of this combat as he tries to eat my friend Joe who's intent is to try to keep our NPC guide alive while Bob wonders if there's some way he can use his die to help make sure Joe doesn't get eaten".<br/><br/>After playing through a game of tMW I'm definitely interested in trying it out again with a different group of people.  Hopefully this is the right place for this, and thank you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chronicler" title="chronicler"><img alt="chronicler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chronicler">chronicler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208906/#Comment_208906" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T18:29:00+00:00" title="May 24, 2009  6:29PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our group we have simple rule:   do it clockwise<br/>\nAll conflincts are sequential &amp; and going as FIFO stack.

We made some effort to break apart intent-triangles like the ones posted above, but it felt clumsy.  On the whole I found the group conflict mechanics to work great and be very straightforward, so I'm interested in keeping them around.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: A. Yermakov</cite><br/>3.

(If we are talking about R vs B conflict w/ stake as G's wound)</blockquote>\nWell, I don't mean a conflict to wound someone, per se; as I understand it wounds are something the victor can dole out *instead* of the intent, if the victor so chooses.  I can declare the intent to cut someone's arm off, and upon success I can chose to cut their arm off *or* inflict a wound on them, right?  So if I'm trying to cut the arm off of an NPC and a PC tries to stop me I'm pretty sure I can wound the PC even though my intent is to cut the NPC, since the PC is the one who's opposing me.  <br/><br/>I'm just not sure how this translates to the (#3) PC triangle; my instinct would say that Red can (with enough success) kill Green or give Blue a wound, but he could not give Green a wound since Green didn't have a die in the conflict (as Green's die was busy killing Yellow).<br/><br/>It seems odd, though, which is why I'm not even sure if the dice are lined up right.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>The Mule<br/><br/>Edit: screwed up my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> example reference here, should be fixed now &gt;&lt;;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chronicler" title="chronicler"><img alt="chronicler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chronicler">chronicler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208945/#Comment_208945" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T07:23:02+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  7:23AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            #3.

Conflicts can only ever have 2 "sides" or "teams" (though within a given "round", you can have multiple independent conflicts resolving at the same time).<br/><br/>So if this situation came up in play, some sort of player negotiation would be required. <i>*Personally*</i>, I usually give dibs to whoever declares their intent first. So maybe something like this would happen:\n<blockquote>Green: I want to kill Red!<br/><br/>GM: OK, so Red you're going to be in a conflict with Green...<br/><br/>Red: Oh, I was hoping to kill Blue.<br/><br/>GM: Hmm, Blue do you want to "side" with Green, or do you want to do something else?<br/><br/>Blue: No, I wanted to kill Green, so I'm going to "side" with Red, actually.</blockquote>\nRemember here that "sides" are a mechanical concept, not a narrative one. It's kinda like the ol' saying, "the enemy of my enemy is my friend". I believe in the book I used an example of a tengu and a crumbling wall "teaming up" against a ronin, though the wall and the monster weren't "working together" within the narrative.<br/><br/>#2) This one is easy. You have Green and Red on one "side", and Blue and Yellow on the other.<br/><br/>#3) OK, so you end up with Yellow and Red on one "side", and Blue and Green on the other. No one is using Trust, so who ever rolls highest gets to narrate what happens. If Red gets highest, he can choose to give a wound to Blue or Green.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208957/#Comment_208957" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T09:06:43+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  9:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you!

In game terms you cannot change your stake during conflict resolution, but you can add wound at other character or smth like that if you have more than one success.</blockquote>\nI wouldn't say that's "wrong", per se, but the practicalities of narration aren't so black and white. The narrator has to balance and decide amongst all the possibilities of the conflict. And since the number of "Successes" are limited by the margin/Degree of Success, that naturally means some of those possibilities will happen, and some won't.<br/><br/>Specifically in relation to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, when Blue joined in the conflict, they opened themselves up to the possibility of damage or some other negative consequence. If Red's player decides to narrate the outcome of the conflict against Blue, that's not considered "changing their stake"---it's just following one of the many possibilities of the conflict, while leaving the others (specifically, wounding Green) untouched.<br/><br/>Following me?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mule</cite>[A]s I understand it wounds are something the victor can dole out *instead* of the intent, if the victor so chooses.  I can declare the intent to cut someone's arm off, and upon success I can chose to cut their arm off *or* inflict a wound on them, right?</blockquote>\nCorrect. The way I like to explain it nowadays is that a Success can be interpreted/narrated as either mechanical damage or as a "narrative effect", completely interchangeably. As I said in the book, "conflict is a form of combat".<br/><br/>Most of the time, a player's intent will imply some sort of narrative effect, so switching it over to mechanical damage is (usually) pretty simple. Going the other way, from mechanical damage to narrative effect, is also totally kosher, but it can sometimes be a bit tricky. The narrating player has to use some judgment as to what type of narrative effect would logically flow out of that particular conflict (which would have likely been some sort of fight, if the player had declared they wanted to inflict damage).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>I've had some complex situations come up in the game before...
