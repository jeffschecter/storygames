I also prefer games where the default tends toward scenes involving most or all of the protagonists at the same time. Finally, I don't like people sitting around, bored. If most or all of the protagonists are together, that tends to serve the last point of my trinity there. I also don't like to break the Czege principle, which states that it's not fun for you to provide your own adversity.<br/><br/>So, I like games where protagonists provide secondary or less opposition to one another, where they are often together in scenes, where people aren't ignored, and where the Czege principle is not violated. To accommodate those preferences, a GM is usually required: a player of non-protagonist characters who can provide adversity to assembled protagonists.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98317/#Comment_98317" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T13:01:48+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  1:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'd better defend the GM and defend them from people like me.<br/><br/>I will destroy them all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98318/#Comment_98318" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T13:03:07+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  1:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They are in danger of disappearing from the hobby altogether, after all. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98320/#Comment_98320" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T13:05:31+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  1:05PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, Rob, I brought asshattery to your cool thread.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to say.

Unfortunately I can more easily think of disappointing incidents than I can positive ones. For example, there are so many things I love about Shock:, but the problem of having protags together and also having one of those protags play an antag seems to be an insoluble one native to the structure of Shock:.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98323/#Comment_98323" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T13:22:38+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  1:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add that I don't hate GMless games and can and have had fun with them, and there are times where having a GM hasn't made things rosy and good.

That can be accomplished on various levels, but I definitely prefer games that support it systemically and people who support it by being aware and enthusiastic.  <br/><br/>Unlike you, my personal taste runs toward conflict between players and their characters.  I don't think you're violating the Czege Principle when you say "I really want my ex-wife to be in the next scene giving me hell, guys."  At what point you feel like you are providing your own adversity certainly varies from person to person.  <br/><br/>I don't think any of this is influenced by how you divide up authority, though.  I can just as easily play an NPC and kick your guy in the nuts as required regardless of my role, fellow player or GM.  The only thing you might lose in a theoretical completely equal distribution of authority is full-bore protagonism from every player all at the exact same time.  This doesn't mean that investing a lot of that power in a GM is a bad idea, though, if that's what works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98325/#Comment_98325" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T13:38:26+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  1:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mine was just a good-natured bit of ribbing.

I'll even put it in bold.<br/><br/>Jason,<br/><br/>You picked up something that was niggling in my head as I wrote this. I failed to talk about it when I posted because it wasn't very clear in my brain. So thanks for once again helping me crystallize my thoughts. To whit:<br/><br/>I agree with you that you can certainly achieve full player participation without having the all or most of the players' protagonists in every or almost every scene. I can think of two ways to do this. The first I'll call <b>The system made me do it</b> and the second, <b>I'll be that guy</b>.<br/><br/><b>The system made me do it</b>: The system can encourage player attention that is separated from the pretend actions that that player takes with a character in the scene. An easy example is <i>Primetime Adventures</i>'s fan mail: You need to watch what's happening in a scene to know who to give fan mail to. Another is Ben Lehman's <i>Adventures in the Land of 1,000 Kings</i>, where your character knows what's going on with the other protagonists because your character is you and knows what you know.<br/><br/><b>I'll be that guy</b>: This can be an at-the-table convention or part of the rules, where players may be encouraged to take the role of non-protagonist characters present in a scene that their protagonist is not in.<br/><br/>That said, I usually prefer protagonists in most scenes together most of the time.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I'd agree with this statement fully:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I don't think you're violating the Czege Principle when you say "I really want my ex-wife to be in the next scene giving me hell, guys."</blockquote>\nHowever, if all of the protagonists are in the scene, who's going to play the ex-wife? That's why my preference for GMs in games I'm in comes out of a nexus of:\n<ul><li>stories where the protagonists are highly involved with one another and usually in every scene, PLUS</li><li>protag-vs.-protag conflict as secondary or less, PLUS </li><li>the Czege principle.</li></ul>\n<b>SUMMARY: I agree that player attention can be gotten in other ways than the players' protagonists being in every scene, I just prefer it that way. Also, other people can play my adversity, but then it's hard for their protagonist to be in the scene too.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98329/#Comment_98329" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T13:57:16+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  1:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fifth_child</cite>Mine was just a good-natured bit of ribbing.

One of them was, what does a GM <i>not</i> have to do? I found the reply might be worthwhile here, so:\n<blockquote><cite><a href="http://indie-insurgent.livejournal.com/3820.html?view=1772#t1772" rel="nofollow">Me on my livejournal</a> edited a little bit</cite>The truth is I'm pretty flexible [on what a GM should not have to be responsible for]. I can have fun with games in which there is no GM, for example. I just tend to prefer one where there is a GM. Right now my gaming is 1) a bi-weekly Shadowrun game which is fairly traditional in terms of GM role but there's a little wiggle room, 2) a weekly Burning Wheel game run pretty close to the book which means it's a strong GM for the indie game scene but not for the traditional one, and 3) conventions, where I prefer to run Primetime Adventures and my game, Misspent Youth, both of which like to have GM as plate-spinner, scene cutter, sort of an intermediary through which a lot of the rest of the story flows.<br/><br/>Now that that incredibly long-winded disclaimer is out of the way (to summarize: I like lots of things but I do have preferences), I'll talk about what I prefer for the GM not to have to do.<br/><br/>First, motivation. I think motivation should come from the players. The GM should be very cognizant of what the other players want, either by reading it in the flags on their character sheets or by asking them player-to-player about it. She should use these techniques to figure out what the players want from the game, combine that with what she wants, and then try to give it to them and solicit it from them.<br/><br/>Second, mechanical rewards (xp, hero points, fan mail, etc.). I prefer game systems where players claim their own reward based on clear rules and/or the assent of the table.<br/><br/>Third, protagonist improvement and change. I prefer games where protagonist improvement or change--and the resources that allow for such--are player or table generated and players are responsible for keeping track of their own advancement/change or for making a case for it to the table.<br/><br/>There are very likely to be many others but these leap to mind fairly easily.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98371/#Comment_98371" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T20:32:42+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  8:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, I don't think we're far apart or that our play styles wouldn't easily mesh, Rob.
