Also, either use pre-gen characters to get the game moving if character generation would take more than 10-15 minutes.  I have witnessed the travesty that is spending an hour and a half of the four hours in chargen and seen the boredom and suffering on the faces of the players involved all too many times.  <br/>Also make sure it's a game you have ran before!  I've made the error of a con game being the first session I'd ran of a paticular game,  and I made some goofs that I wasn't terribly proud of.  If you must run a new system, at least make sure you've run some sort of playtest with your local group or other willing test subjects.<br/>And have fun with it!  A con game doesn't have to be continued, so go ahead and give the players the earth-shatteringly powerful Macguffin you would never dare unleash in a campaign game, blow up the world or have whole the whole Norse pantheon show up for tea!

This may change if I run SotC, as it looks to me as if the "collaborative character generation" part of the fun. Does anyone who has actually run SotC have any experiences on how well this actually pans out?<br/><br/>Anyways, as far as pregens go, I've heard the advice to provide characteristics and relationships (with all the other PCs) for all the PCs; I've yet to find the latter gets paid much attention to.<br/><br/>One thing I did do this last gencon is add a "tactics" section that sort of lays out the capabilities and role of the character, so you don't have fighty characters doing sneaky stuff and vice-versa (this is Spycraft 2.0, BTW). This worked out really well, and I recommend it if you are running a game with many traits/character options where the characters strengths and role in the party might not be bleedingly obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93527/#Comment_93527" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T13:01:23+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  1:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alan,<br/><br/>I'd go with pregens with SotC, maybe with some blank spots on the character sheets for some collaboration but the stunts and skills can take a while.<br/><br/>Polaris, PTA, Shock:, Carry and Dogs in the Vineyard all come to mind as fast chargen, fast start games where making the characters is doable and even preferable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93534/#Comment_93534" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T13:32:25+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  1:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On what Judd said about shaking hands...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we're at the table at GenCon, and a guy is looking for a game at Games on Demand. So somebody suggests that he sit in on one of my playtests of Other Worlds. So I try to be social. The conversation went something like:<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: "Hi, I'm Mike. Tell us who you are, and, could you tell us what RPGs you're into?"<br/>\n(See I'm trying to get some context so I can explain how OW works to him)<br/>\n<br/>\nGuy: (Fails to introduce himself) "Uh, I play all sorts of stuff."<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: "Cool... can you tell us what the last RPG you played with your group back home was?"<br/>\n<br/>\nGuy: "Um... we play so much stuff I can't recall."<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: "Uh... OK... what have you played at the convention so far?"<br/>\n<br/>\nGuy: (starting to look like a cornered rat) "Uh... mostly I've been wandering around."<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: (listening carefully to what's going on around me) "What's that you say Kat? There's a game of Faery Noir going on that needs more players? Well I have one more than I prefer to run with. Hey, dude, you should try out this other game that's going on over there. It would help us a lot!"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI said to the people at the table (to whom it was patently clear as to what I'd done and why) that I felt guilty, but only because I had foisted this guy off on another game. Call me the big bad elitist, but if you don't have basic social skills, enough to give your name, and talk about the RPGs you've played previously, I'm sorry... but I don't want to play with you. I don't think this is a very high bar I'm asking people to get over, and almost everyone does just fine. I'm a shy person too... but I've always taken steps to try to be at least minimally social with the people I meet at cons. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause if you're not comfortable with actually socially meeting with people, then how do you expect to have fun playing a RPG with them? It's not chess.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93544/#Comment_93544" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T14:22:14+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  2:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2007 2:28PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strangely, shaking hands was one of the things I took away from Gateway this past weekend.<br/><br/>I get it.

There are parties... and then there's this.<br/><br/>Aware of this, whenver I was at a game that wasn't filed with people that knew each other, I'd just jump forward and go, "Hi, I'm CK," and shove my hand before them.  The first time I did it was just sort of out of panic, like, "Oh, shit we're not even doing the basics of being nice, if we can't handle this, the game's gonna suck!"  Then it just became a thing I decided I had to do.<br/><br/>What struck me about this -- the reason it made such an impression -- was that on three separate occasions this prompted this peculiar chain reaction where everyone suddenly shoving their hands in front of people they didn't know and started introducing themselves around the table. It was like there was this <i>pent up desire to do the formalities of being nice</i>, but that we had no context for doing them.  But once someone broke the ice, the way people were making sure to introduce themselves was almost a relief.<br/><br/>We talked about this on another thread -- the open socializing model that leads to gaming rather than jumping into gaming at cons.  But I think we need to face the fact cons have YEARS of training behind them where social graces were left at the door, connection to actual people was left at the door.  <br/><br/>From my experience at this weekend, it's hardly a deal stopper.  As far as I can tell all it takes is one person to start things rolling and everyone jumps to the chance.<br/><br/>Now, I had no one like Mike's story.  I was lucky, maybe.  80% of the people I played with I had never met before.  But there were no jerks.  Everyone was great.<br/><br/>But I also think -- if my experience at Gateway is any indication -- there's a shift taking place in Con culture.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93546/#Comment_93546" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T14:24:52+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  2:24PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was GMing I haven't had anyone refuse my hand or find themselves unable to introduce themselves.

I've come to believe that creating characters and situation is a vital part of play, and I don't want to cheat the con players of that part of play.<br/><br/>I was up front.  I said, "I can't guarantee we're going to reach a cool end of con session climax. I won't be rushing anything to get to the big finish.  What we're going to do is play the game. And the game starts -- here..." and I'd distribute the character sheets.<br/><br/>I don't know whether everyone was satisfied.  But <i>I</i> was.  As far as I was concerned we were playing, and as far as I could tell all the players were engaged from that moment on.<br/><br/>CK<br/><br/><i>Edited to Add:</i>  It occurred to me that the games I played in worked this way as well: <i>Grey Ranks, Poison'd, Psi-Run</i>, and <i>Shock</i>.

Some players may take a while to get through some challenges and/or get more engaged with interaction and other unplanned activities. But some will whip right through it. So to stay flexible, I make at least one "drop in" scene/encounter/activity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ross" title="ross"><img alt="ross" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/ross_winn/pic/0000syzd"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ross">ross</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93748/#Comment_93748" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T12:26:41+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 12:26PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic feedback!

Introductions are the best things ever, even if you forget the person's name halfway through the game.  I had a pretty dull game experience, and it started from the beginning when I, a player, suggested that we all use the nametags the GM brought with him.  (The badges were on yard-long lanyards, so they hung below the table.)   The GM wrote his name on his.  I wrote my name and my character's name on mine.  The three others just wrote their character's names.  I even tried to introduce myself to the other players.  I have no idea who those people were.<br/><br/>The other thing I like is to leave takeaways for the game.  I let the players keep their character sheets and always point out the URL for dog-eared-designs.com at the bottom of my PTA character sheets in hopes that someone will pick up a copy of the game (it's worked once that I know of), or a flyer with info on how to pick up the game and communities like Story Games, or related things.  (For my Lacuna game, I gave whomever opened the mysterious folder I left on the table 823 experience points to spend in any game of their choosing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
