Ones with secrets, ones that fell sinfully short of their potential, ones that did something horrible that they are trying to make right, or that are in denial and who may or many not begin to make things right.<br/><br/>Sometimes this is The Fool archetype.  They may have high intelligence, but they have a fatal blind spot.  In D&amp;D or similar systems this has often been a Rogue or Scholar/Mage type.  A recent example was my Maester Oswyn from an A Game of Thrones campaign.  He was a milk-of-the-poppy addict as well.<br/><br/>Maybe as much as a quarter of my characters are beset by prophetic dreams or are reluctant oracles.  I think I fell into this early on as a spotlight-on-my-own-terms device, but have stayed with it as a mode of a character's true self coming though and forcing change on an otherwise impenetrable conscience.<br/><br/>I also like austere, brooding men of the North, be they Vikings, Cimmerians, or other.  These have done hard things, wield cold steel, and have no mercy for their enemies.  They stay in denial and/or find justification in their environment.  They had no choice but to be what they are.  Do not question them.  Their sword is their only answer for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151566/#Comment_151566" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T23:15:35+00:00" title="June 18, 2008 11:15PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play sleazy chumps, assholes and slimeballs and nobody, including myself, is ever quite sure if I think they're great, if I know they're idiots, or occupy some bizarre middle realm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151569/#Comment_151569" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T23:46:45+00:00" title="June 18, 2008 11:46PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play lovable, reckless Han Solo types, or cold, professional, soldier types.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age... has really gotten me out of my rut.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151583/#Comment_151583" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T04:13:27+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  4:13AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like playing good-hearted people with ill-executed plans.

One time, when we were fleeing enemy cavalry, he circled back to KABOOM them one last time, cackling madly and screaming "Mage-Lord Gyric has widowed your whore wives and orphaned your brats!" before going Falcon Form and catching up with the others in the group. My "swing thought" while playing him was Richard from <a href="http://lfgcomic.com/" rel="nofollow">Looking For Group</a>, leavened with some Mako Wizard (from Conan movie) gesticulations and exhortations.<br/><br/>* Storm Surge, a elemental master (water) in Aberrant, whose taint was so high that he was down-right terrifying to mundanes--a man-shaped, walking, clear-water hulk. Didn't help that he would often "fill" himself with tropical fish, who would disconcertingly swim across his face or jump out of the top of his head to snare flies and such. He wasn't averse to drowning someone with a bear hug, either. His famous line, used when the party (of, like, 10 or so!) would get into a big "what do we do now" debate: "I am a weapon; aim me."<br/><br/>* Does a Dog with the traits "Violence is never the solution" and "I will not use a weapon on a human" count as a nutter? The other Dogs thought I was, as I took bullets from Sorcerers with a smile (well, grimacing smile) and continued to preach peace.<br/><br/>* A street bum with amnesia in a Hero game, who believed he was an itinerant knight in a high fantasy setting (the real setting was modern day Earth). Thing is... he had a 1d6 penetrating, always-on, area-of-effect Transform power which would, in fact, MAKE the world into high fantasy around him, if he stayed in one place too long. Wouldn't change anything's capabilities or powers, just recolor them--an airplane he was on slowly transformed into a dragon with a bowdah on its back (for passengers). He was very paladin-esque, and he had a dependent NPC (a disad) that was a little girl street urchin who tried to keep him moving and out of trouble. Otherwise, he'd end up having to get out his "sword"--once a baseball bat, now an Excalibur-esque vorpal blade.<br/><br/>As should be obvious, I like to get wild with PC concepts, as my work day is so dull and rational (tech writing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151636/#Comment_151636" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T08:55:00+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  8:55AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been (rightly) said to play an inordinate number of unctuous creepy characters, although they are usually basically good.

Good and noble, caring and compassionate, frequently more than a little self-righteous and usually formal. Behind this is usually a bridled passion for life, seeking some means of escape. Occasionally there is a darker side, strictly kept in check, which is the reason for the formality. He cares, but he can't allow himself to care too much, because that would make him vulnerable. Usually has "archaic" ideas about honor and chivalry. Always at least competent martially, frequently prodigiously skilled. If the character concept includes magic (which isn't necessary for the paladin, IMO) he specializes in healing and benevolent magic. This character type has shown up in Supers games as Jonathan Black, a.k.a. Ebon, and in fantasy games as Darius Wolfe, Adrien Locke and once a Trystan. He has also been a Dog named Thaddeus Jonah Gentry, nicknamed "Dove".<br/><br/>I also have a fondness for an archetype that I call "Nikki", though the first incarnation was christened with the blatantly stolen name "Tyris Flare". Nikki is a strong-willed, self-reliant, very competent female warrior. She's usually got a feminist streak of varying widths, though she doesn't hate men; she just tends to like to show them up in areas they are typically stronger than women. She's also exceedingly flirtatious, which conceals inexperience in sexual matters, and frequently a history of emotional or physical/sexual abuse. She's hard-nosed and cynical and doesn't always stick to the most righteous way of handling things, but she's got an unbending sense of honor all her own. She most frequently appears as Nikki Steiner, which originated in a home-brew Battletech game I made when I was a pre-teen. <br/><br/>Another type that has shown up a few times is the overtly hostile, foul-mouthed punk. He's a good guy, but he wouldn't want you to think so. He spews vitriol at the drop of a hat, has a temper shorter than an ellipsis... which he uses to hide (are you getting a common theme here?) his severe insecurities about everything; His own basic self-worth most of all. The first time I can recall actualizing this character is in City of Heroes, with Ebonclaw, a regen/claws scrapper. <br/><br/>I also like the undersized wise-cracking sort. Small and thus frequently underestimated, this guy is a survivor. He's got an unshakeable belief in his own ability to always come out ahead, and more often than not, he does. He's friendly and pleasant to be around, and always has a joke or wise-crack ready for any situation. He talks smack, but there's never any malice in it. He views himself as a generally likeable guy, and as such, usually is seen as such by others as well. He has shown up most notably in City of Heroes as Dyne Midas, a.k.a. TNT, a pint-sized Invulnerability/Super Strength Tank, and in Dungeons and Dragons Online as Ebo Lightfoot, a halfling rogue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151665/#Comment_151665" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T10:56:14+00:00" title="June 19, 2008 10:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the trainwrecked burnout of a veteran archetype, often with substance abuse issues, or (as I've grown older) the tragic father-figure.<br/><i><br/>Example of the latter: </i> Had an Exalted Dawn Caste human Dynast who Exalted when his Dragon-Blooded daughter returned from the Threshold with a dagger that turned out to be his previous Solar incarnation's possession.  In the delirium of Exaltation, he inadvertently killed her betrothed, then cast himself into the sea afterward as penance.  He woke on a ship, plucked from the waters by the GM's Sidereal mastermind.  His grieving daughter, believing her father's soul devoured by the Anathema spirit, joined the Wyld Hunt and pledged herself to his destruction.<br/><br/>For a lark, I once generated a character in a GURPS game that loaded up the disads, producing a lecherous, greedy, overconfident, alcoholic hunchback rounded off with a few odious personal habits.  *I* had fun, but I retired him after a handful of sessions out of mercy to my fellow players.<br/><br/>I'm also fond of the underpowered trickster--the guy with minor, non-splashy abilities who through clever, opportunistic use ends up kicking ass.<br/><br/>Had a Vampire character once who went from scholarly, non-combatant grad student to tattooed badass psychopath in a delicious and dizzying descent as I gleefully pissed away my Humanity.  I'd taken Dark Fate, which the text in the book says is peculiarly liberating--and it was.  I leaned this guy into the blade big-time, no regrets.  I leveraged low-level Dominate, Auspex, and Thaumaturgy (Caitiff who the GM arbitrarily turned into a Tremere in the prelude).  The rest of the party were Gangrel, Toreador, and Brujah combat monsters.  They had nothing on this Tremere cast-off.  What was cool was that I had excellent story reasons for the Humanity-losing stuff I did.  And I made a few Conscience rolls along the way, so...*ahem* yeah.

Only slightly joking.</blockquote>\nJonathan, I hope that the only joke is that it's only twenty pages long.  I want this so badly that I can taste it.  <br/><br/>As for me, in those rare times when I play and not take on the gm-like role, I play broken people.  My most recent characters have included:<br/><br/>Carmen Navarro, a woman road warden character in a zombie apocalypse future version of our own world.  She was the daughter of the town whore who died while trying to save her during the original zombie outbreak.  The campaign started with Carmen being drummed out of the local militia after she had been bitten by a zombie.  She had tied off the wound with a belt so that only her left arm was zombified, a terrible, hulking mass of atrophied flesh and twining muscle.  She was bitter, resentful, and trying to come to grips with a humanity inside of her that didn't fit into the terrible world that had fostered in the ashes of the old.  <br/><br/>Jasper, my replacement character in the same campaign that I played Carmen in.  She had ridden off into the sunset so I introduced a new character.  Jasper had been a sheriff on a native american reservation that had holed up after the zombie outbreak.  He was the son of the town's previous sheriff who had been a heavy-weight boxer in his younger days, and a Christian missionary worker.  He tried to keep the peace while carpet-baggers moved in from the big city and tried to take the town over, promising the townspeople supplies and jobs.  They were let in by the tribal council, along with their own policing force.  When one of those cops got a little too friendly with a local girl Jasper shot the man dead and went on the run.  <br/><br/>And Marco Orcavi in the Reign campaign I'm in.  Marco is the cousin of Anton Orcini, the inheritor of the throne of a family of assassins.  Marco was born to a splinter of the family that had been master healers.  After a terrible mishap in his younger years had seen his family killed, Marco was taken in by his aunt and uncle in the Orcini clan.  To carry his own weight, a young and angry Marco joined the navy, where he saw hundreds of men die in terrible ways.  This experience tempered Marco, creating a morality within him that revered life and saw murder as an abomination.  He became conflicted when his beloved cousin, the only real family that Marco had, wanted to take over the family business.  In helping his cousin rise to power Marco became a shell of a man, slivering his morality away until he was ordering hits on enemies to the family and murdering foes with his own bare hands.  If that campaign is a fantasy version of the Godfather, I was playing Michael Corleone.  <br/><br/>Oh, and then I played Malcolm Neeland, the Investigator in a game of Dirty Secrets.  He had been an intelligent man but relegated to bruiser status in the criminal underworld because of his size and intimidating demeanor.  He was sent to prison after a score had gone bad and while there read tons of books on criminal investigations and mystery novels.  He found himself useful to the crooks in the prison because of his blossoming deductive skills, able to figure out who had really shivved who and so forth.
