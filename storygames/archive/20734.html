He mentioned that he liked to play board games with some friends. I mentioned that I dabbled in game design, but that I had more quirky tastes, and was particularly interested in games which created stories, narrative, fiction.<br/><br/>He asked me a few questions, and we went on to talk about something else. <br/><br/>Another friend on mine had a brief discussion with me about randomness, and I tried to explain that randomness can be combined with human choice in various ways. As an example, I sent her a link to a Fiasco playset I'd written. She asked how it worked, and I pointed her to the Fiasco Tabletop episode on YouTube.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I find out that these two people know each other! They apparently sat down and watched the Fiasco Tabletop episode, were totally thrilled, and immediately went out and bought Fiasco.<br/><br/>So I guess I'll have to facilitate a game for them now! Interesting. I'll be very curious to see how much they learn and/or infer from watching that video, and how much they will wonder about or ask questions about. It will be interesting to see!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455546/#Comment_455546" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-08T22:39:29+00:00" title="August  8, 2016 10:39PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you could have played a story game during the car ride with him...
