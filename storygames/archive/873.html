                    So, I've been sitting on a bunch of ideas lately, thinking of ways to put them into various games.  And of course, like most folks, doing that thing where i keep my unique (or stolen-and-polished) ideas close to my chest, for fear that someone will <b>STEAL MY IDEAS!!</b> OH NOES!!!<br/><br/><i>Because, like, someone's gonna run out and use my idea and make a game and sell thousands of copies, and I'll never be able to use that idea again!!</i> :-)  Yeah, lame, I know, but I know that I'm sitting on some ideas I haven't shared, and I'm pretty sure others are, too.<br/><br/>This thread is to post those ideas. Not to develop those ideas, but simply a canvas or post-it board where you can throw ideas at it. Get stuff circulating. Maybe the ideas can be taken and used by others, so that by the time you put them into your game they'll have been made better by someone smarter, and thus improve your game idea as well.<br/><br/>I'm gonna toss out a couple here, and come back in a day or two when I find my notebook where I jotted down a bunch of crap.<br/><br/>Oh, and I put this thread under "Little Ideas", which is only visible to the Story Games community. Benefits of being a member and all that (so if you link to this thread on your blog or whatever, unregistered visitors won't see crap). Also, I figure on creating a new thread every season or so to track new ideas.<br/><br/>Let it out. Your ideas are not sacred little lambs. Even if you only have one or two, throw them out there!                </div>

                            Random ideas:<br/><br/><b>Opposing Stats</b><br/>Source: Stolen from a Japanes RPG (Chivalric Warriors of Fusou)<br/>So, say you have like 6, 8 or 10 stats: They come in pairs (perhaps drawn out on opposite sides of a hexagon, circle, etc) and together have to add up to "a number" (15 in the example game).  So if you have "Virtue" at 9, "Passion" will be 6. Strength 10 means Speed 5. Yin of 3 means Yang of 12, etc. <br/>So stats just aren't these ever-increasing units.<br/><br/><b>Random Story Elements</b><br/>Source: AG&amp;G<br/>The idea of rolling on a chart geared towards the setting, and then being FORCED to put those elements into play is something that is really exciting to me. As Remi says "It scratches a deep itch I have". I'm trying to find a game to push this idea into.<br/><br/><b>Set Characters</b><br/>Source: Game Chef (last year), and the thread on design goals for gateway RPGs hit that bell again.<br/>I'm very interested in making a simple, quick game where there are something like 6-10 set characters, with a choice of three personality types or something: So the sexy enchantress can be the lusty power-monger archetype, the quiet and ernest type, or the "paladin from hell" type, and from that point on the game looks like half RPG, half "How to Host a Murder Mystery".<br/><br/><b>The Tarot</b><br/>Fuck, man, the Tarot is awesome, but even after I created that thread a few months back on using the Tarot in new ways, my brain is still tapped trying to fit it into one of my current designs.  It's still on the back burner, though.<br/>Most likely, I'll be using the <b>Major Arcana Only</b>. None of that "use the numbers on the cups/swords/etc" in lieu of dice shit, I'm thinking Everway but on more, and in some ways less, steroids.                        </div>

<b>The Group Clan/Org/Party Character Sheet</b><br/>Source: Originally my own, but refined and driven home after seeing it in use in a Japanese RPG called "Infinite Fantasy", a simple game based on a huge web-based for-pay play-by-post fantasy game.<br/>So, a leader is chosen among the characters in some way (their "leadership" score is higher or whatever). That person controls the "group sheet", which has maybe a few, or maybe many, resources to manage or control (in the example game, the leader gets to choose one of his special abilities, and Everyone in the whole party can use that ability, only fewer tmes per session. Also, parties have an alignment that kind of function like TSOY's keys: So the Party, rather than players, have keys). This is cool because it brings back the old school D&amp;D party back into action, and gives it some glue without being arbitrary and lame.<br/><br/><b>Totally Different Mechanics for Different Players</b><br/>Source: IIRC, I heard this first from Jonathan based on one of his games. Depending on the role/type of character the player chooses, the mechanics will be VERY different for that player vs another player. It will look like they're playing two seperate games, but they influence each other.<br/>Example that I'm thinking of: 5 players, one is the GM: Two players pick "protagonists", and their abilities and play styles look very much like traditional games: stats, skills and whatnot. Then the other two players pick "support", so they control a pool of a few characters, run with many of the GM-made NPCs, and use completely different dice and make very different rolls (almost like PTA-style rolls). Together they work with and against each other to push the story forward.<br/><br/><b>Tactical Game using a Battle-mat or Chessboard</b><br/>Kinda been rolling this one around for like a year, it's my take on Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea the RPG: Basically there are RPG scenes with a fanmail mechanic, and the more fanmail you have the more influence you get during the tactical parts. When the board and pieces come out in between RP scenes, you move and fight tactically, and tactical gains there (like falling enemies and the like) give you points which you can use to influence your RP-side character.  The character sheet has two parts, the RP side and the Tactics side (like two halves of one letter-sized paper).<br/><br/><b>The Mancube</b><br/>Source: Lame idea I came up with on my own, but am currently hammering out for playtest.<br/>You draw out your character on a specialized piece of paper: Filing out blanks as appropriate with skills, passions, fates, and a few numbers. When everyone is done, you cut out and fold this paper up into a cube. When you do things (drifting between conflict and task resolution), you roll the Mancube and go with the results. One of the sides has your character's Fates, and an Arrow: That means that the person who the arrow is pointing towards gets to take your cube and move it to the face that they think is the most interesting.<br/>Currently stuck with how to roll the cube: I'm thinking that you would also roll it before scene framing to determine what kind of scene you Should frame next.<br/><br/><b>Hero Quest/Descent... But an RPG</b> (Hero Quest and Descent being those huge board-game family-game dungeon crawl style games with the little dungeons and pieces and stuff: But the above are all about loot and killing monsters, this is all about acting and telling a story based on set elements)<br/>Same as above post's PreGen Characters, but in this case the pregens are printed out all pretty-like, the game is more "gamer-y", and you have resource dice and stones to play with.  The game itself has a board and resources and the like (maybe a GM, maybe not), and the story is pretty much set as per the board (drifting between politics, combat/dungeon and emotions/romance), and the players have to do their best with their resources to get through the story. The story ends up being different each time you go through because of all the bizarre variables and acting.  Heavy RP, and LOTS of Fanmail.<br/><br/>So those are some of the ideas I'm sitting on, I can't think of any others for now. Feel free to throw yours into the pile, even if you have just one or two. Maybe someone will find something worth sifting through, and can polish it up and make it work.<br/><br/>Oh, the only one I hold kinda sacred above is the Mancube one, only because it's both very gimmicky and very lame, but I'm revelling in the lameness. If you are, like, truly inspired to pick up this totally geeky idea and run with it, go ahead but I'd appreciate a heads up first (if I don't do anything with it for a month or two, feel free to just grab it and go). Other than that, though, take as you will.                        </div>

<p><strong>Dominoes as Fortune controller</strong><br/>
I did up a couple pages of notes on the idea, but never quite got around to using them for anything.  The idea being that you draw a certain number of dominoes and have them in front of you to choose from.  Then, when you laid one out to have an effect on the narration there would be an effect based on the number that pointed toward you and the number that pointed away from you.  And there's no duplication in a single set of dominoes, which seemed like it would lead to something neat.</p>

                            GAH! Lost post! Reconstruction follows:<br/>
<br/>
I'm reading a couple of books about Afro-Caribbean religions (Obeah, Voudou, Espiritismo) and Rastafarianism. Ostensibly I'm thinking to build a game set in an alternate reality version of the Caribbean slave revolts of the 18th &amp; 19th centuries (alternate because Rastafarianism as a messianic movement is too cool to leave out but didn't develop until the 20th century). As far as design ideas, I'm still brainstorming, but might involve the Tarot. I also like the idea that in Afro-Caribbean religions a devotee might be overcome or posessed by a being of power such as a spirit or loa, and I want to build that in as a mechanism for character-sharing between players. Probably not much will happen with this in the short-term as I slowly read my background books, so this probably belongs with ideas for the fall or winter. Anyway, there it is. <br/>
<br/>
Fred, I am very excited about the game you're looking to develop. I think you're absolutely on the right track for it based on that thread. <br/>
<br/>
Andy, I love the Mancube idea. Any thought to making other polyhedra beyond cubes?                        </div>

You play cards from your hand face down to initiate stuff in the world, then turn cards over to resolve stuff.  The cards suit refers to one of the four stats that is the focus of thre resolution, and the number tells you whether you get to narrate the outcome or if somebody else does, etc.  Cool crunchy bits for face cards, narration when the card hits your number exactly, etc.<br/><br/><b>Agreement instead of conflict</b><br/>Source:  Improv class<br/>The only conflict is seeing who can make their fellow players look the best.                        </div>

<b>Saga</b><br/>Character-driven story system. Start with a conflict web with a main conflict in the middle. Link characters to conflict and each other. Each link allows you to have one trait for that character. Traits are either general or specific; selecting which specific categories of traits are available (e.g., violence, sex, intrigue, war) also serves as flagging and establishes rewards (for currency that buys traits and other stuff) that relate to that area.<br/>Resolution mechanic is twofold: you draw cards according to traits. You discard a certain amount. The remaining ones are separated into numbers and faces. Number cards are added, higher number wins the stakes. Face cards are compared highest to lowest. Each "trick" you win there gains you one influence point. These are immediately spent on gaining advantages (more cards against this character -&gt; gain momentum -&gt;pacing toward showdown), changing the <i>other</i> character's traits (change "master swordsman" to "in love with my character", lowering efficiency but also allowing for complications and rewards), or taking out the character completely (cost depends on number of traits). So you can win stakes but have your character altered or killed/exiled/driven insane in the process.<br/><br/>That's all I've got time for now.                        </div>

<b>Figures instead of Classes</b><br/>Instead of a class which gives you currency to buy specialized resources (Class X gives you two feats and one spell, Class Y gives you one feat and three spells), have a list of Figures (as in Historical Figures) that players pick.  There can only be one of each Figure at the table, because Figures are named.  Each Figure gives you a set of currency to buy specialized resources, just like classes, so you've got the same flexibility.

                            Impro System - Taking the things gleaned from Johnstone's Book and incorporating them into a game. ( And now that Venture Bros. has started again I need to get back on that) . I am really into using an egg timer to keep things moving. If nothing happens by the time the egg timer finshes draw a card and shoot off in another direction end of turn. I am looking at ways to build story on the fly and reward the players for making it work. <br/><br/>A system which allows the whole group to do something every turn. Most games, and the stuff we model them on, spotlight a character and deal with them, then spotlight someone else. I am looking for a system that will talk about what we are all doing in this turn (or whatever) which we discuss together.<br/><br/>Similarly, a system to help players who have differing goals to play together. Some way for me to be rewarded for helping Dan to get his fighty thing going and a rerward for him for helping me to plow my character into misery.                        </div>

                            I love the domino idea, and had something in mind that I brought up in channel quite a while ago about using dominoes for a sort of combo and reversal system in combat. I never really fleshed out the idea, or even really gave it another thought until I saw them mentioned here.                        </div>

Have you ever seen the free rpg 'Brains and Brawn', which used dominos in pretty much the system you described?  I can't seem to find a non-corrupted copy of it, which saddens me 'cause it's the one domino roleplaying game I've found, but it was really interesting.<br/>

<p><strong>No Character Sheets</strong><br/>
Everything you know about the characters can be represented by some big communal board, moving tokens around and stuff. Lose the paper clutter, make the thing self-contained.</p>
<p>Relatedly,</p>
<p><strong>Connected Character Sheets</strong><br/>
Things you change on your sheet have immediate and visible impact on the way other characters work. Ninegun sort of does this, but I want to make it even punchier.</p>

                            Mostly I have setting ideas that I need to come up with good games for...<br/><br/>There's this free side-scrolling MMORPG from Japan called <a href="http://www.mapleglobal.com/" rel="nofollow">Maple Story</a>, which has this weird mix of anime-style western fantasy and modern-day casual stuff, so most characters start off wearing a T-shirt, and you go out and whack monsters and eventually get better skills and so on, and you can wind up with anything from barbarian armor with a big horned helmet to a thief with a leather jacket and beanie. So, my idea is to have a modern-like world where there are monsters running around (but never inside towns for some reason), and monster-hunting has become a sort of casual hobby that teenagers get into if they want to earn extra spending money and have fun hitting things, but the availability of monster parts on the market has let to stuff like magic and healing potions becoming available. And I have no idea how to approach this or what to do with it. :P<br/><br/>I'm praying that the Action Point system I've come up with for the new version of Thrash works out (it looks good on paper at least). Each character gets 3 AP per turn that they can use or save up, to a maximum of 6, where a light attack costs 2, and you can spend them during the other guy's turn if you try for a counterattack.<br/><br/>If I ever get around to doing my fantasy heartbreaker (Eternal Saga) I want to use the XP system I stole from the .hack games, where it always takes 1000 XP to go up a level, but the value of defeating a monster depends on its level relative to yours -- but non-combat rewards are always worth the same amount towards your next level. Also from .hack, I have this notion of an RPG where you play players of an MMO where weird shit is going on, and set up the system so there's two "tiers," a simple narrativist thing for the players and a crunchy and at times deliberately illogical gamist thing for when they're playing the MMO.                        </div>

                            1. Players donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play individuals but movements, deploying individuals in pursuit of their conflicting goals. Wrinkle: the individuals donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily stay loyal, and their individual goals modify the goals of the movements. <br/>2. Version of the above: Players play the leaders of teams (possibly linked to their teams telepathically) with some kind of mechanic covering dominance/loyalty Ã¢â‚¬â€œ i.e. the player can command team members to do something but they may fail or refuse. <br/>3. Both of the above at different scales, plus the individual scale. <br/>4. Players Ã¢â‚¬Å“escalateÃ¢â‚¬Â the plot, tossing plot twists at each other which raise the stakes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so they are taking two roles, their character and some form of fate or author. <br/><br/>On dominoes, I have been working on some games inspired by Cheapass Games and the Piecepack but using standard dominoes, dice and cards (which everyone has or can cheaply get), referring to it as the "base game set". The dominoes usually form the board. Details <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/project.php?project_id=49" rel="nofollow">here</a>. No story games as such yet.                        </div>

<p>This could be incredibly cool... I think the only way it could work is that, during any given instance of play, the only things that could be affected are things controlled by those present. 'Cuz otherwise you get shit like, "Oh, you guys hired Leo to take out the half-owlbear mage? But Jess and I totally bound Leo's soul to a pentacle and incinerated his body last week!"</p>
<p>Unless you've got some way to deal with contradictions like that? 'Cuz that would rock.</p>

                            Oh yes.<br/><br/>I'm planning a horror game about space marines who fart, burp and argue. Working title is <i>Schlock; Anti-Social Science Fiction</i>.<br/><br/>Sorry, I've wanted to get that joke out for ages. I know it isn't very good, but I feel better now it's out there.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            This one is still very rough and more setting than mechanical so far, but I'll throw up what I've got.  I'm working on a game that I want to explore the Wierd Vs. Mundane of shows like Eerie, Indiana and The Adventures of Pete and Pete.                        </div>

                            These are the things rumbling around in my brain that aren't Spirit of the Century, Dresden Files RPG, or Fate.<br/><br/><b>Faith &amp; Credit</b><br/><br/>Honestly, this is Rob's idea, so I can't get into it in too much detail.  But I encourage him to write about it if he feels up to it!<br/><br/><b>Gilgamesh</b><br/><br/>I'm looking to take some of the ideas I used in Don't Rest Your Head and turn them into a mythic heroes kind of game, possibly with a Babylonian focus -- weird gods, bronze-age hipness.  I keep finding myself using greek terms for certain concepts, but the mapping from DRYH would go a little something like Discipline -&gt; Judgment; Exhaustion -&gt; Hubris; Madness -&gt; Pathos.  (And Pain -&gt; Destiny, perhaps).  The mechanics would function a bit different where those various pools dominate, and instead of Fight or Flight there'd be a number of passions, like Fury, Lust, Zeal, Sorrow, which would consume you when  Pathos dominates, that sort of gig.  Probably a little finer detail on the things you carry and what matters to you, rather than the full-on oomph of the Exhaustion and Madness talents of DRYH, etc.  It's an early concept, but I think it'll have legs.<br/><br/><b>Sun God</b><br/><br/>In the spring, He is in love, and the land prospers.  In the summer, He is betrayed, and His wrath scorches the land.  In winter, He regrets, and the world passes into ice and darkness.  How long each of the three seasons might last is never knowable; it depends on the growing or fading passions of the Sun God.<br/><br/>This might be a LARP-style scenario ala Amber Diceless, or a background mythology for the fantasy game of your choice, or a "gods walk among us" foreground mythology where you play mortals tangled up in the Sun God's court.<br/><br/>The setup focuses on one of the two cusp events of the cycle.  Either it is winter, and "we must find a new love!" Or it is spring, and "we must conceal her infidelity!"<br/><br/>Touchstones here are Polaris's lyrical take on things, Amber's "everyday gods", the fallable gods of ancient myth, and a 24-hour game concept I wrote up called "Divinity" that I'm noodling around finding a more developed home. Speaking of which...<br/><br/><b>Divinity / Matching Mechanic</b><br/><br/>When I wrote up <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/lab/Divinity.pdf" rel="nofollow">Divinity</a>, I was taken by the idea of a mechanic that let you express character sheets on a business card, carry around a single 6-sided die, and yet still get some depth out of the resolution mechanic.  Divinity came reasonably close to that mark.  It uses the idea that your die, numerically, might mean something on its own (Lowest, Midrange, or Highest), but if you had traits that what you rolled could "match", then matches would promote the quality of the result to a higher set of tiers (yielding a progression of Lowest roll, midrange roll w/no matches, Highest roll, midrange roll with a "stat" match, midrange roll with a "skill" match, midrange roll with a double match).  This is all a very dense way of expressing something that the linked PDF above expresses much better.  Regardless, this idea continues to bang around in my brain and look for other homes.                        </div>

                            Well, Fred tagged me elsewhere, so what the hell.  <b>Faith and Credit</b> is a historical game set in Post-Colonial America under the Articles of Confederation.  America under the Articles is sort of a black hole in most people's knowledge that boils down to "they sucked, and then we had the Constitution" but it's almost custom made for gaming.<br/><br/>You have a wildly diverse, but loosely affiliated, populace and geography with intense political factionalization over both the big issues (Central government versus States rights) and small ones (individual state squabbles).  You have a compelling conspiracy to change the government and you have pressures and influences coming in from Europe, all to say nothing of Native Americans, Pirates and Freemasons.  For a handful of patriots working to keep the nation together, there's an infinite array of possibilities.<br/><br/>Even beyond the potential for adventure, you have the advantage of a huge cast of familiar characters to throw in who, honestly, are easy to work with.  One of the joys of modern biography is that so long as you can find a few core points out about someone, you can get crazily interpretive with it.<br/><br/>Really, this is a challenge to myself to do two things: First, I want to make a fun historical game without needing to add in any weird elements.  Honestly, there's so much to work with that adding magic or the like would end up diluting it.  The other thing I want to do is make an _American_ swashbuckling game.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            [b]The Girls From Yesterday[/b] - a roleplaying game involving a group of jilted women in suburbia who are dealing with the 5 stages of grief, might never be made, but I've got a rather interesting mechanism for moving through the 5 stages of grief.  Each stage is represented with a die (Denial is d4, Anger d6, Negotiation d8 and Depression d12) and also ranked with a value.  Whichever stage has the highest rank is the one you're dealing with for any given conflict, which in turn determines the die size you're rolling.<br/>
<br/>
If you roll at, or under, the rank, you move that many 'points' from the stage to the next stage.  If you roll over the rank, you add another point to Denial.  You're through grieving when you clear out everything, meaning you've made it to Acceptance.                        </div>
