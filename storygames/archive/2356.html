                    We often say that a game is "crazy," or to admonish a creator we don't like we refer to them as "crazy." Submitted for the aproval of the midnight society. <a href="http://philippe.tromeur.free.fr/hybrid.htm" rel="nofollow">Hybrid: the roleplaying game</a>. So certifiably whacked out, i dare anyone here to attempt to play this.<br/><br/>an excerpt:<br/><br/>"RULE # 287: The equation for the evil god or demon of the storyline of the movie â€œHellraiserâ€ in terms of how many souls &amp; their bodies that he can devour &amp; take to his personal dimension of hell would be @ # souls = 10^[-1 + (C2 PL)/100]. So, if he were @ 200 C2 PL, heâ€™d be able to devour ten or 10 souls along with their bodies he could take to his personal dimension of hell, but his DP or Default Psyche would be less than 200, and his LS or Life Span would, also be less but less than his DP. So, his DP could [hypothetically] be @ 100 C2, while his LS or Life Span would be @ 50 C2 @ 2x that of the MU Wolverine @ 40 C2. But, his LS or Life Span would need to decrease further to [100/4] = 25 C2 which = maximum human life span of 152 years which would increase his PL or Power Level to [100*4] = 400 C2, allowing him to devour 10^3 souls &amp; their bodies: 100 C2 DP is @ PL of Godzilla."<br/><br/>Its like "the yellow king" RPG                </div>

Actually, Philippe is the guy that did Wuthering Heights, IIRC, and is non-crazy. He just (for some unknown reason) contacted the Hybrid guy and said, "Hey, I'll host your crazy madness!"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Now that I think about it, however, I think that Hybrid may be the sanest RPG ever. RPGs, as an activity, are just a tad insane at heart.<br/>

                            I don't think that he's either crazy, nor a mysogynist (if he's a mysogynist, he's even more of a racist), nor full of bile and certainly not stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Might Hybrid be pointless? There's a good argument to be made there. Or it could just be a very subtle piece of art. Like those huge paintings with a ton of elements that don't seem to make sense in context with each other, but which may have a gestalt all their own.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it causes my neurons to fire like only good RPGs normally do. So maybe I have failed my San Check. You'd expect me to behave any differently then?<br/>

                            OK, maybe I should elucidate what I'm thinking a little more clearly. What if this guy has figured out things like that the notion of hiding behind a character to allow you to express bad feelings, is, itself, bad. That is, what if this is a parody. People claim it's an elaborate troll. The only problem I have with that is that it's gone on in obscurity for a long time. I don't think it means to attract attention, but rather just makes some interesting statements. Potentially.<br/>
<br/>
Like math for math's sake in a RPG doesn't make the game better. Like obsession with certain source material (WWII or your favorite flavor of Star Trek) makes for bad judgement in rules creation. Heck some of it may actually be a comment about FATAL. Which is bad precisely because it, unlike Hybrid, actually could be played in theory.<br/>
<br/>
Obesession with levels.<br/>
<br/>
I could be seeing a clever criticism where there is, in fact, just stuff that should be criticized. I dunno. But think of it this way. If it's bad, perhaps we can use it as a guideline for what not to do, or what to avoid?<br/>
<br/>
I recall saying in Rant <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> that one should read DeadErth just to see how not to make a RPG. Same could be said here. That way you don't have to buy my view that it might be art.<br/>

<p>I'm with Ben. I think this is insane in the same way that Henry Darger was. That is, we are blessed with a glimpse into someone else' mind that is not like our own, untarnished by attempts of clarity.</p>
<p>I have a whole section of my bookshelf devoted to this. I have a book from the Moonies claiming to be a series of essays written by every single dead President of the US announcing the one true way. I have a book entitled simply "G" that is entirely in code (it's a Mason thing). I have a copy of the Voynich Manuscript and a book claiming that George Lucas was talking about Jesus Christ when he said "The Force".</p>
<p>Communication is very rarely solely about what the author wants to say; a lot of it is "I'm fine, how are you?" social stuff. Which is great; it keeps us friends and lets us know who has to be put on a donkey backward and sent into the desert. But things like HYBRID or The Story of the Vivian Girls are pure expressions of what's going on with someone else. Mockery's inappropriate only because the viewer really has a hard time seeing the scale of the vision; it shares too little with the viewer's experience.</p>
<p>This is the closest we come to seeing the mysteries of the human mind. It's so hard to understand what someone else means because it's so hard to say it. This guy is <em>saying it</em>; the fact that it doesn't mean anything to you isn't his concern.</p>
<p>It is beauty as honest as that of a beehive or a hurricane: it is complex and uncaring for you but its beauty can be seen, if not understood.</p>

                            Posted By: Kevin Allen JrWe often say that a game is "crazy," or to admonish a creator we don't like we refer to them as "crazy." Submitted for the aproval of the midnight society.Hybrid: the roleplaying game. So certifiably whacked out, i dare anyone here to attempt to play this.<br>
<br>
an excerpt:<br>
<br/>
"RULE # 287: The equation for the evil god or demon of the storyline of the movie â€œHellraiserâ€ in terms of how many souls &amp; their bodies that he can devour &amp; take to his personal dimension of hell would be @ # souls = 10^[-1 + (C2 PL)/100]. So, if he were @ 200 C2 PL, heâ€™d be able to devour ten or 10 souls along with their bodies he could take to his personal dimension of hell, but his DP or Default Psyche would be less than 200, and his LS or Life Span would, also be less but less than his DP. So, his DP could [hypothetically] be @ 100 C2, while his LS or Life Span would be @ 50 C2 @ 2x that of the MU Wolverine @ 40 C2. But, his LS or Life Span would need to decrease further to [100/4] = 25 C2 which = maximum human life span of 152 years which would increase his PL or Power Level to [100*4] = 400 C2, allowing him to devour 10^3 souls &amp; their bodies: 100 C2 DP is @ PL of Godzilla."<br/>
<br/>
Its like "the yellow king" RPG<br/>
<br/>
THE ABOVE EQUATION IS PARTLY BASED ON THE DC CHARACTER FIRESTORM, IF HE WERE @ 20 C1 DP, MAXIMUM D20 CHARACTER HE CAN CAPTURE 1 ENTITY INTO HIS PERSONAL DIMENSION; BUT, HE HAS LOT MORE POWER[S], IS WHY HE BE @ BETWEEN 20 TO 30 C1 DP, WHERE 30 C1 DP IS HIS MAXIMUM C1 DP VALUE, WHERE HE CAN ALTER LARGE AMOUNT OF MATTER FROM ONE ELEMENTAL FORM TO ANOTHER INCLUDING INTO SLIGHTLY COMPLEX FORMS, ALSO: HE PREFERS TO DO OR USE HIS POWERS IN ON LARGE SCALE, IS WHY HE PREFERS TO USE HIS POWER[S] IN SIMPLE WAYS, RATHER THAN IN COMPLEX WAYS, SINCE THE LATTER WILL REDUCE THE SIZE &amp; VOLUME OF SPACE THAT HE CAN EFFECT HIS POWER[S], IF HE WERE TO HIS POWER[S] IN COMPLEX WAY[S], THE SIZE &amp; VOLUME OF SPACE HE CAN EFFFECT WILL DECREASE, WHICH IS WHY THE DC FIRESTORM USES HIS POWER[S] IN SIMPLE WAYS[S] RATHER THAN IN COMPLEX WAY.<br/>
<br/>
THE -1 IS FOR CHARACTER LIKE MU LOKI; 0 FOR CHARACTER LIKE MU DR DOOM; +1 FOR MU CHARACTER MYSTERIO. THE THREE TYPES OF MODIFIERS ARE [-1, 0, 1], IN THE ABOVE EQUATION; &amp;, WHAT # U USE TO DIVIDE HIS C2 DP BY, THAT # WILL DETERMINE SIZE OF POCKET DIMENSION: U USE 50 FOR THE MU MYSTERIO; BUT, IF U WANT POCKET DIMENSION THE SIZE OF DIMENSION OF ASGARD IN THE MU UNIVERSE, THEN USE 150, RATHER THAN 100: YOU CAN ALSO USE THE ABOVE EQATION FOR THE SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE [CUBE, PART ONE] &amp; [CUBE, PART TWO], USE VALUE OF 100 FOR THE MOVIE [CUBE, PART ONE] &amp; USE VALUE OF 200 FOR THE MOVIE [CUBE, PART TWO], IN THE ABOVE EQUATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY ENTITIRES THAT CAN BE CAPTURED &amp; TAKEN TO DIMENSION OF PAIN, USING THE ABOVE EQUATION. OK.<br/>
<br/>
THE 100 REPRESENTS SIZE OF POCKET DIMENSION; THE SMALLER THE LS OR LIFE SPAN OF CHARACTER U REDUCE, THE LARGER PL OR POWER LEVEL HE WILL HAVE USING REVERSE MATH NOTATION, ACCORDING TO RULE # 3; SO, IF U REDUCE 100 C2 LS TO 20 C2 LS, BY [100/5] = 20 C2 LS, THEN U CAN INCREASE PL FROM 100 TO 500 C2 PL, BY [100*5], WHERE U NOTE THE REVERSE MATH NOTATION [/5] ON THE 100 C2 LS AND THE [*5] ON THE 100 C2 POWER LEVEL. THIS EQUATION IS PARTLY BASED ON THE DC CHARACTER FIRESTROM, WHERE IF HE WERE @ 20 C1 DP OR 50 C2 DP, HE COULD CAPTURE 1 ENTITY INTO HIMSELF, LIKE THE PROFESSOR HE CAPTURED, BUT HE NEEDS LOT MORE POINTS, HE WANTS TO CAPTURE MORE ENTITIES INTO HIMSELF. THE C1 DP RANGE FOR THE DC CHARACTER FIRESTORM IS BETWEEN 20 &amp; 30 C1 DP, WHERE 20 C1 D0 IS MAXIMUM A CHARACTER CAN BE IN A D20 GAME @ 20 C1 DP, WHILE 30 C1 DP IS MUCH GREATER, ABOUT THAT OF MU LOKI, WHO HAS A C2 DP RANGE OF BETWEEN 100 &amp; 200 C2 DP, WHICH IS AN ESTIMATE, BASED ON THE CHARACTER DESCRIPTION THAT I HAD READ OF THE MU VERSION OF LOKI, GOD OF MISCHIEF. THE ABOVE EQUATION CAN BE REWRITTEN IN FOLLOWING WAY TO FIGURE OUT MAXIMUM # OF ENTITIES THAT MAIN EVIL CHARACTER IN HELLRAISER CAN CAPTURE IS BASED ON THIS EQUATION: [2.718^((HIS C1 DP) - 20)]; SO, IF HE IS @ 30 C1 DP, THEN 2.718^(30-20) = 2.718^10 = 22,026 ENTITIES THAT HE CAPTURE &amp; TAKE TO HIS DIMENSION OF PAIN. THIS NEW EQUATION DOES NOT VIOLATE RULE # 3, WHICH IS DETERMINES HOW C# POINTS R MANIPULATED IN MY RPG.<br/>
<br/>
A ANOTHER EQUATION IS GRAVITY EQUATION: TO DETERMINE VALUE OF GRAVITY FOR AN OBJECT IN [FT/S^2] BY THIS: ((C2 DP)/100)^LOG10(C2): YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE ANY CALCULUS WITH THIS EQUATION: BUT, IF THE OBJECT HAS LIFEFORMS ON IT, THEN A MODIFIER HAS TO BE ADDED TO THE FINAL VALUES; SUCH AS SINCE EARTH HAS LIFEFORMS ON IT, U GIVE C2 DP OF THE MAXIMUM LIFEFORM, SUCH A WOMAN WITH 30 COM BE @ 31 C1 DP, CONVERT IT THAT TO C2 DP &amp; ADD THAT VALUE TO THE PLANET EARTH, IF THERE WAS SOME OTHER TYPE OF LIFEFORM WITH A HIGH C# DP VALUE, THEN GIVE THAT VALUE TO THE EARTH, COINCIDENTALLY EARTH HAS GROWN SLIGHTLY OVER THE PAST 100 MILLION YEARS, SLIGHTLY, ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN COURSE OF EVOLUTION, TOWARD A HIGHER LEVEL. OK. SO, THEN VALUE OF EARTH BE @ 380 + 167 = 547 C2 DP: NOTE THAT I DO NOT ADD 380 C2 DP + 167 C2 DP, BUT RATHER [380 + 167] C2 DP: THERE IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO NOTATIONS: REFERRED TO AS DOPPLER EFFECT AND RESONANCE THEORY: THE FOMER WILL GIVE A SMALLER VALUE, THAN THE LATTER, WILL GIVE THE CORRECT C# DP. SO, THE THE SUN BE @ 1,000 C2 DEFAULT PSYCHE WITH GRAVITY OF 1000 [FT/S^2], BY [[1000/100]^[LOG10(1000)]] = 10^LOG10(1000) = 10^3 = 1,000 [FT/S^2] GRAVITY; AND, SINCE THERE IS NO LIFEFORMS ON THE SUN, YOU DO NOT NEED TO ADD ANY MORE POINTS TO THIS VALUE OF 1,000 C2 DP, THAT IS THE FINAL VALUE C# DP FOR THE SUN. OK. &amp;,<br/>
<br/>
AND, FINALLY THE GOLF EQUATION FOR SOMEONE WITH LOW COM VALUE, SUCH AS TIGER WOODS, HIS EQUATION IS:<br/>
<br/>
[1D6 + 1D6 + 1D6] @ C2 DEFAULT PSYCHE: THIS EQUATION ONLY WORKS FOR SOMEONE WITH LOW COM VALUES: THE EQUATION HAS TO BE MODIFIED FOR SOMEONE WITH A HIGH COM VALUE. THE FIRST 1D6 IS FOR HIS COM IN TERMS OF C2 DP; THE NEXT 1D6 IS FOR HIS FAME OR/&amp; FORTUNE; &amp; THE FINAL 1D6 IS FOR HIS SKILL: TOTAL OF 3D6 C2 DP. OK.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            Rule # 287 can be rewritten in the following form, # of entities that can be captured = [(e=2.718)^((his C1 DP) - 20)]; you can use this equation to figure out that Vengence is @ 25 C1 DP &amp; Dungeon Master is @ 36 C1 DP, in the 1980s cartoon series storyline [Dungeon Master]. THE stat DP is for Default Psyche: LS for Life Span &amp; PL for Power Level, for C#.<br/>
==================<br/>
Another equation, such as for Tiger Woods, be @ [1d6] + [1d6] + [1d6] @ C2 DP @ 3d6 C2 DP, this equation works for only someone with a low COM value: you have to modify this equation for someone with a high[er] COM value.<br/>
================<br/>
Another equation is equation for gravity in [ft/s^2] = [[(C2 DP)/100] ^ [LOG10(C2 DP)] + C2 DP of highest liform] @ C2 DP; so, earth be @ 380 + 167, with 167 being 30 COM for some woman somewhere on this planet, giving our earth a total of 547 C2 DP; the sun  has NO lifeforms on it, so you just give C2 DP of based on its gravity of 1,000 [ft/s^2], giving the sun a C2 DP value of 1,000, by [1000/100] ^ [LOG10(1,000)] = 10 ^ 3 = 1,000 [FT/S^2], FOR GRAVITY OF THE SUN @ C#.                        </div>

Yep... I was on r.g.f.super-heroes back then, and well remember it.  I tried to discuss his "RPG" with him a couple of times, then abandoned it because any attempt was futile.  After that, I tried to killfile him, but he kept changing the address he was posting as, so I'd have to do it again every few months.  <br/><br/>From my few attempts to discuss the "game" with him, I have to go with the idea that he's crazy.  He literally appeared to be unable to see why anyone might not think that his "game" was the best superhero game there was.                        </div>
