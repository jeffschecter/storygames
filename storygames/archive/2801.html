Jedi leaping from platform to platform hanging above an impossibly deep pit, starfighters flying at top speed impossibly close to the trench walls and trying to avoid getting blasted by the force-wielding Empire pilot behind him, a pilot and his Wookiee chasing a whole squad of stormtroopers down the hallway...  All of that seems to scream for a system that focuses on action.<br/><br/>The exception, to me, is something like Knights of the Old Republic.  There, I can see it... tough moral choices, actions and consequences, destiny, yadda yadda yadda... that works just fine with a more rules-light system like Dogs in the Vineyard, and in fact we played a few sessions, in my group, of Jedi Dogs and had a blast with it.<br/><br/>Am I totally off base here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63607/#Comment_63607" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T06:22:55+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  6:22AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2007 6:26AM by eruditus.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2609&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a thread to look at.

IMO, one of the few valid complaints about WotC's d20 version of SW is too much attention to detail. Besides things like having to track your ammo (when did that ever happen in the movies?), there are supplements that are full of specific stats for a bajillion types of blaster pistols and all kinds of aliens. Looking at the films, a blaster is pretty much a blaster, and the only difference between the various alien races are makeup and whether they speak in gibberish or not. The mapped system for starship combat is also tedious as heck. We played out one Tie Fighter vs. a Falcon-class ship and it literally took us hours.<br/><br/>I dunno. Unless you're a die-hard Expanded Universe fan, I think one of the hallmarks of SW as a setting is that <i>the details don't matter</i>. As the prequels proved, the more you explain details, the more stupid the setting gets.<br/><br/>Ergo, I'd agree that any SW RPG should play fast. In a single film, you can see a character go from whiny farmboy to Death-Star-destroying ace fighter pilot and nascent Jedi. I'd think that any SW RPG should be able to do that, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63618/#Comment_63618" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T07:33:08+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  7:33AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>As the prequels proved, the more you explain details, the more stupid the setting gets.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's kind of what I was getting at, actually...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63621/#Comment_63621" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T07:41:15+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  7:41AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think all the fiddly bits of blaster shopping and so on in d20 scratch the same itch as all that gearhead nonsense in d6 like the big org chart of the Empire. People who like that stuff like playing Star Wars "as if it were real". That's just one of many ways to approach genre gaming. It's somewhat deconstructive while not being totally revisionist.

It was very Sim. I devoured all the source material I could find, including a paperback "encyclopedia" for the Star Wars universe. Our games in that universe weren't that much about the Empire vs. the Rebellion but more like a bunch of paramilitary people trying to survive in that universe. Eventually, the Empire would piss off the PCs enough that they'd at least empathize with the Rebellion if not outright join. Basically, they were all Han Solo types looking out for themselves. They weren't always heroes but it was good fun.<br/><br/>Later on, when we started playing the WEG Star Wars game, that trend stuck. The occasional Jedi character didn't really fit in with the ragtag mercenaries that just wanted to make a credit or two. I called it the "Fuck the Rebellion" campaign, not because they were fighting against the Rebels but because they just didn't seem to give a shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63642/#Comment_63642" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T08:59:21+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  8:59AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oddly enough all of our Star Wars games (d6 or not) played like a 'dysfunctional misfit' version of what the Star Wars universe is supposed to be about: the characters were intrinsically cowards, heroics was something that happened accidentally (while in the process of saving our own skin), and the "Jedi" of the team was consistently the most callous and immoral member of the whole team (actual in-game quote from the player: "I don't understand why I would get a dark side point for shooting the merchant in the head.

Like, for example, I want my Jedi powers to be flexible and adaptable, so I can do something cool I thought up on the spot rather than just the same trick over and over again.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel like Star Wars should be closer to <i>Spirit of the Century</i> than 3rd Edition <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63743/#Comment_63743" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T18:37:52+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  6:37PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2007 6:38PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool - to me, 3e D&amp;D is all about action (that's what all that stuff on your sheet is for!

That says, I'm largely ignorant of Star Wars D20, and what it may do wrong or right in the promotion of <i>ACTION!</i><br/><br/>I think (untested by me, I've never gotten to play the game) that one of the best elements in Star Wars D6 for bringing out the <i>ACTION!</i> would seem to be the Wild Die. For anyone who doesn't know, you would roll one different-colored die with all your rolls, and if it rolled a 6, it would "exolode," letting you roll again to boost your success, but if you rolled a 1, it was either: A) a catastrophic failure or fumble, or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> a <i>complication</i>. To me, the "Fumble" option is ass, I've never liked those "you toss your sword through the air like an idiot and impale your buddy" type results/interpretations. But the <i>complication</i>. . .man, I would totally play with that option. 'Cause the thing is, you still get to check the roll for success or failure, and in addition, succeed or fail, the GM adds in some mishap to furl the character into greater inconvenience or peril. <i>Total Star Wars.</i> "Hah, I told you I could fly us through the Asteroid field to escape!" "Yeah, but. . .the cave you've hidden in is the belly of a freakin' space worm!"<br/><br/>Hmm, I wonder if it wouldn't be cool to use the 6 on the Wild Die for the same sort of thing--a plot twist that is <i>helpful</i> to the character. "Ooh, you took a nasty tumble on your Speeder Bike. . .but you met a helpful little Ewok pal!" Then again, while fortuitous turns of events <i>do</i> happen in the series, nobody ever mutters, "I have a <i>good</i> feeling about this." <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63764/#Comment_63764" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T03:12:38+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  3:12AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><br/>Later on, when we started playing the WEG Star Wars game, that trend stuck.
