A humble young musician gets a big break, and gets surrounded by an accretion of agents, fans, groupies and sycophants.  The more that happens, the harder it becomes for him to be anything but an arrogant, entitled celebrity:  the expectations and actions of everyone around him reinforces that pattern.  He gets trapped in the world of being a celebrity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, there are people out there (PCs) whose strength is that they don't work in patterns.  Rather, they make direct human connections.  Those human connections are what a person locked in this sort of pattern needs, in order to change themselves and break out of their own pattern.  Those human connections are made when someone makes themselves <i>vulnerable</i> to another person.  They are pattern-breakers.  Again, this isn't metaphysical, it's just my observation of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo PCs in this game are folks who get shafted by the patterns of another character's screwed-up world, and then act to change it ... often (if not exclusively) by revealing some human connection and vulnerability.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to create an NPC for a session, one obviously needs the world-view they're trapped in.  I can model that.  But the <b><i>other</i></b> thing that (I think) one needs is a sense of their potential interactions with the PC.  How are they going to react to vulnerability and human contact?  With longing?  With fear?  With disdain?  All great options, and all ones that make for very different NPCs.  A Lonely Celebrity is different from a Fearful Celebrity is different from a Disdainful Celebrity ... and they're going to create different landscapes in which for the players to tell their stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don't know how to break this thing down properly into formula.  What is it, in understandable terms, that distinguishes these NPCs?  How can I describe it in terms that will inspire, rather than confound?  And what's the right break-down?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83264/#Comment_83264" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T12:09:42+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 12:09PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is the next-door-neighbor of an idea that I got from the recent (locked, flame-y) relationship map battle on rpg.net.<br><br>One aspect of Sorcerer r-maps that is not necessarily true of r-maps in general is that the relationships listed there are <i>permanent</i> - now, the text that was quoted in the thread emphasized family relationships but I can also see worth in recording relationships that are about events that happened in the past.  ("Cheated out of $50 grand", "fired after she resisted sexual harassment", and so on.) These are immutable - or, maybe more accurately, all change that occurs along that relationship "line" is additive.  You might make it up to the guy you cheated out of $50 grand by paying him back and setting him up with a hot girlfriend but you can never un-cheat him.  It's not just family that we can't change - we can't change our past either.<br><br>Then (by contrast) there are relationships that can change, in other words, the stuff on the line is not connected to immutable defining events.  <br><br>Now, the difference between the two sorts of relationships is itself different for different kinds of stories.  Here I am thinking of a Vampire r-map from the early nineties in which two powerful vampires are described as enemies.  The line there isn't "you fucked me over, I fucked you over, that can't be changed", because that's inherent in the relationships of powerful vampires, due to the setting. They can have fucked each other over 100 years ago and still be as good a friends as it's possible for vampires to be.  The immutable part of the relationship is "we are both powerful vampires in a world where powerful vampires' relationships are founded on distrust and paranoia".<br><br>So if you want a game where it's easy for relationships to change, you give a big amount of latitude to the mutable bits of the R-map and not so much to the immutable bits.  If you want a game where it's not-so-easy, you give a lot of latitude to the immutable bits and not much to the mutable bits.  (This is how classic Western tragedy does things.)<br><br>Anyway, that's the half-baked idea your comment reminded me of. Interesting stuff.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83316/#Comment_83316" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T14:22:48+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  2:22PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the cousin to something I'm working on as well - "burnups".

If so, I don't think you want a mechanical switch. What you want is a basis for whoever is handling the NPC to make a judgement about how the NPC will respond.

I guess I was thinking more along the lines of Vincent's whole <i>Fruitful Void</i> discussion ... in the same way that Dogs town creation forces people to <i>address</i> the conflict, but has nothing whatsoever to say about <i>resolving</i> it, I was thinking that I mostly wanted something that would force players to <i>address</i> the ways in which their vulnerability challenged the world-view of the main NPC, but have nothing to say about how to <i>resolve</i> it.<br><br>Sorta like, the system should push as hard as possible to make sure that the NPC does <i>change</i> as a result of contact with the PCs.

I see your challenge to make the NPC like a town in DitV. A conflict and a situation that has a need to interact with the PCs, as opposed to making it a NPC that the needs to be interacted with by the PCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you take an NPC that acts in a so and so way (perfectionist idol), and give hir a motivation (conflict between Love/Duty) and make hir seek out the PCs to resolve this conflict, you have a one-man town.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can then have mechanics for how the NPC acts, how the want/reason modifies situations, but not having mechanics for how the PCs resolve this.

These worlds are, themselves, a way that people <i>avoid</i> being vulnerable.  The Idol might not be happy, he might not be satisfied, he might in fact be actively miserable ... but he's not forced to expose himself.  And, since he hasn't exposed his feelings in so long, his fear of doing so is compounded by massive ignorance.  He fears more than just the consequences of being vulnerable ... he fears the <i>unknown</i>.<br><br>The core story of the genre (as best I can dig it out this morning) is "PCs encounter such a person.  PCs want to break through that shell (for various reasons ... love, friendship, hatred, compassion, rivalry, principles, practicality, etc., etc.)  By caring about breaking through that shell, the PCs make themselves emotionally vulnerable.  The NPC sees a person who, <i>unlike every person inside his structured world</i>, makes themselves vulnerable ... and he sees that being vulnerable, and even being hurt, is not so bad.  After seeing that, he cannot view the prison he's hiding inside in the same way."<br><br>It's sort of like GMing for a turtling player:  You can't, <i>actually</i>, break through their shell.  They have to want to come out ... and they want to come out when their connections to what is happening outside exceed their fear.<br><br>That's my fuzzy description of why I think vulnerability is the tool that makes a difference.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83768/#Comment_83768" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T06:56:14+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  6:56AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kaare Berg</cite>So if you take an NPC that acts in a so and so way (perfectionist idol), and give hir a motivation (conflict between Love/Duty) and make hir seek out the PCs to resolve this conflict, you have a one-man town.</blockquote>Oh!
