Being unable to decide, we settled it in the gamer way: 1d6.  We ended up playing Tyler's 0 Hunters.  <br/><br/>Ending at 9pm was too short; there was suggestion of meeting after at Shari's, but we ended up not.  I think next time we'll plan for an "after party" at Shari's or somewhere, for those who can.  I love -- love -- love Rainy Day Games, but when I first requested the time slot their hours were 'til 10pm on Fridays.  In between that and the first session they switched to closing at 9pm.  Plus they're reasonably central for the westsiders, plus they have games!  (If people want another GoPlayPDX Westside, I'll maybe hit up Shari's or Java Nation or another coffee place.)<br/><br/>Fun was had by all.  Tyler requested feedback on 0 Hunters, and I'll wait for him to start an AP thread on it.  <br/><br/>Over the past week or so I had caught sideband on a discussion about FASERIP Joel was in on a thread hereabouts, and that led me to thinking about awesome-i-fying it.  Thus I almost brought it this time.  And we ended up chatting about it a bit.  I kinda wish I had brought it because, well, awesome!  I'm thinking maybe that deserves a thread of its own, and I might very well bring it sometime.  <br/><br/>Next time, Gadget!  Looks like Friday, June 17, 6-9pm, plus optional after-meet at a location to be determined.  Likely will go no later than 11pm.  Chime in if interested in another meeting at a different place!<br/><br/>(will be x-posted between Story Games and GoPlayPDX.com)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325594/#Comment_325594" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T23:03:15+00:00" title="May 20, 2011 11:03PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah i want to do something after next time, was unable to today but i think i could make it work next month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325621/#Comment_325621" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-21T09:34:36+00:00" title="May 21, 2011  9:34AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2011 9:45AM by Joli.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            0 Hunters was great fun. It's the first time I've played a full game. I like how all the game mechanisms fit together like a little toy. The Fortune at the Beginning method it employs is a bit counterintuitive, but means you get to roll to see how well you did, then you're freed up to describe it however! And the trick of having the lowest roller describe first (like reverse Sorcerer, ha!) gives you a great chain of one-up-manship until you reach the final victor, narrating last.<br/><br/>EDIT: And the way the options scale upward was nice and elegant: "Pick your Role, Mind and Body, now act out a petty squabble! Here's an investigative scene, have an intellectual Trait! Now it's the big fight scene, have a combat Trait and a weapon!"<br/><br/>Michael's Castle Blackbird looks slick! An 8/12 by 11 booklet with beautiful art, and the only game I know where you play a Cabalist and Dilettante side by side!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325729/#Comment_325729" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T18:59:56+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  6:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't wait till next time. I'm really wishing there was a way to have this twice a month. I guess I'll have to put in an effort to make a trek to the eastside GoPlay at some point.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ZeroHunters for the most part, and look forward to playing it again. But I really, really, really want to do DangerPatrol next time. Hopefully, we'll have more people to allow for a few games to run simultaneously. I'll see about getting some of my peeps from Vancouver to make it next month.<br/><br/>...and hopefully, I'll remember to bring the 15"x15" Fiasco playmats next time too. And if any of you have games you want to have people playtest at GoPlayPDX West, but don't have enough printed materials, give me a buzz at gremlinlegions at hotmail dot com, and send me copies of your files, and I'll be happy to help do some layout and print out sample books and sheets, for FREE!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330226/#Comment_330226" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T11:04:46+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 11:04AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're coming up on third Friday, folks.
