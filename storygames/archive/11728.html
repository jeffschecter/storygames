And each one of them has his very own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism" rel="nofollow">henotheistic</a> Religion.<br/><br/>Here's the thing. The Gods know that the mortals misinterpreted their Words, so the current Religions are corrupted bureaucratic caricatures with more paradigms and setbacks than virtues and advantages. And they are ruining the world. So the Gods sent you to destroy them. Permanently and in form, and not just in name. For the Greater Good.<br/><br/>The Gods are practical. What matters to them is the end result, not how you reach it. They are more concerned about ending Dogma, customs and what people do, rather than what people believe or think. And the means are entirely up to you.<br/><br/>Your success is practically warranted. Whatever you try, you'll succeed. It is more a matter of how will you do it, instead of whether you'd be able to or not.<br/><br/>So, with that in mind...<br/><br/><b>Phase A.</b><br/><br/>What would your big, ambitious, world-changing plan be?<br/><br/>How would you destroy Religion?<br/><br/><b>Phase B.</b><br/><br/>Break down your big plan in <i>easy</i> 10 steps. What would you do first? And then? And afterwards? What convoluted and machiavellic (or direct and practical) actions would you execute to reach your objective in the end? (Remember. You can assume anything goes the way you want it to.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261755/#Comment_261755" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T20:12:10+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  8:12PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Phase A.<br/><br/>Divide and Conquor which should be easy as they have no real ties binding them (being Henotheistic rather <br/>than polytheistic)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Phase B.<br/><br/>Step 1, Information is invaluable to planning and planning is the firs t step to doing so we start with <br/>information. Step 1 is to gather as much information about the religions as possible. As these are churches and <br/>not cults, it should be fairly easy. This information should focus on 4 main parts.<br/><br/>A&gt; Organization/Chain of Command/Hierarchies and Dependencies<br/><br/>B&gt; Infrastructure and outside resourcesC&gt; Personnel D&gt; Politics<br/><br/><br/><br/>Step 2, To Strike effectively, we must have resources of our own. As the gods are sending us, I expect some <br/>firepower from them, but one should also look for addittional resources that may be leveraged. This step will <br/>identify people from B&gt; Infrastructure and outside resources and D&gt; Enemies from politics that have to gain <br/>from the churches loss. These people can either be converted and/or tricked/\u2018persuaded\u2019 to betray the churches. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Step 3, Obfuscation. Keeping the mission secret is the key to prevent banding together of the churches which is <br/>not what we want (unless we can control it). To that end the resources from Step 2, must be hidden and our <br/>existance and plans hidden. To do this we will rely on Asymetrical Warfare, front organizations, limtiing <br/>subordants knowledge, and other methods of deceit. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Step 4, Placement. All of our resources must then be places where they may be most effective. This means that <br/>imposters and sabotours must be put in place, rabble rousers ready, fronts solid, and armies massed to <br/>warfooting while maintaining step 3\u2019s results.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Step 5 Monitoring and Repair. <br/><br/><br/><br/>All the previous steps are now maintained. By keeping informed, training our resources, hiding our intentions <br/>and placing our assets we are ready to do the actual moves that will bring the enemy down. This is the default <br/>state and is designed to be upheld. Step 5 is the Cumenation of the previous steps and an ONGOING <br/>PROCESS. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Step 6 Planning/Training<br/><br/><br/><br/>Having a knowledge of our enemy, w ewill now plan harm to the enemy. If special troops need training and our <br/>resources must be gathered, this is when we do so. This is also where we coordinate to ensure the most effective <br/>and confusing strikes in line with all the previous steps. The Plan is Divide and Conquor  targeting the weakest <br/>and/or the most isolated, driving wedged between allies and bringing enemies to blows to make way for our <br/>attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Step 7 Execution ie We do the attacks<br/><br/><br/>Step 8 Evaluation<br/><br/><br/><br/>We evaulate the success and ramifications of the attacks as impartially as required, recognizing the changing <br/>situation where required, promoting and empowering underlings where necessary,  changing tactics and <br/>techniques when possible and keeping what works. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Step 9 Repeat steps 5-&gt;9 as required<br/><br/><br/><br/>Step 10 Profit                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

They've killed several in the pre-story.  We've been playing several arcs in the 13 Cities, each city has its own god... and it is pretty benevolent "gods walk among mortals" setting.  But now we are flipping over to the Occularae, the godkillers, because the moral, philosophical questions really got us jazzed.  Right now, the Sorcerer-King of the 13 Cities has conquered about 1/2 of Occulum.  He was thinking of ascending to godhood himself, becoming the 14th God, but actual gameplay persuaded him to pass his throne bloodlessly to his oldest..(I was his youngest progeny in that arc).  So don't think of this guy has Sauron, much more measured and nuanced and hardly "evil".<br/><br/>Anyway, having the Occularae as a counterbalance to the awesome divine and cultural might of the 13 Cities has brought up ideas like;  why would you want to live under god's yokes.  Humanity should stand on its own feet...and things like that.  Very cool.<br/><br/>And we have come up with all kinds of Occularae delivery systems for that StarMetal... musket ball, arrow, bolt, spear, ballista, garrote, sword, caltrops, grounded powder in the drink... and entire academy of assassins train to become godkillers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261832/#Comment_261832" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T14:54:44+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  2:54PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd Matrix everyone.

It's a slow process, but eventually it'll win out.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito" title="Davide Losito"><img alt="Davide Losito" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.webinprogress.it/allyraid/badtoro2out.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito">Davide Losito</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262934/#Comment_262934" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T04:40:49+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  4:40AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Easy answer... let mortals find physical proof of the existence of their Gods.<br/>Everyone of them.<br/>Let every single Religion have their sacred reliquia.<br/>Then incite holy wars and let them extinct.<br/><br/>Free pop-corns and 3-D goggles for the Vangelos...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262944/#Comment_262944" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T06:15:52+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  6:15AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Form a pyramid scheme that makes people rich by turning their back on religion and establishing down-line members.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262959/#Comment_262959" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T08:27:45+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  8:27AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2010 8:28AM by Tristan.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>So, if the gods are real, why aren't they doing something to change it themselves?

Men are not. They are unable to fully grasp the True and the meaning of the divine actions and words. That is simply not something their minds can really comprehend. So what happens? They misinterpret the communication and mold it to their needs, wants and believes. (Enter religions.)<br/><br/>The gods say "Sky", the humans hear "blue".<br/><br/>That's when you come in. More than humans, less than gods. Some sort of middle ground, more capable of "scaling things down" into a level the mortals can get.<br/><br/>It is more a matter of perspective, instead of power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
