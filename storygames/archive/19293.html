My default mechanic is take Xd6, set aside Y, roll, try to beat 7; every die you've set aside now increases the potency of your rolls. That's it in a nutshell. It works kinda well for what I'm trying to achieve; but now I have something new in mind, and I'm not sure whether to stick to my default mechanic, or try something bold.<br/><br/>I was looking to create a mechanic that has the following aesthetics: <b>power has a price</b>. If you decide to go full throttle, you increase the probability of a backlash/freak accidents. I'd use target numbers like 3, 7, 10, 14 for the different power levels of the spells, so you would need to roll more dice to safely make the rolls. But here's the catch: if several dice come up showing the same number, something bad happens. This mechanic is nothing original or new, as Dark Heresy uses something similar.<br/><br/>Would you go with the new mechanic, or try to come up with something that's more in line with my regular one?<br/><br/>Like having to set aside dice to cast higher level spells, but if the roll fails, something bad happens? Or should I use the catch-mechanic (2-2, 3-3, 5-5) again? But there's no relationship between power level and probability of the backlash.<br/><br/>Looking for input. <br/><br/>Also if you'd like to have a look at the game's mechanics, you can fetch the game for free (for some time now) <a href="http://bit.ly/myFluffyRPG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/myFluffyRPG</a> <br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Georg                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429699/#Comment_429699" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T10:49:31+00:00" title="March 21, 2014 10:49AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd establish a spell book with different example effects, associated with different Emotions and power levels.

How would combining that with an Ars Magica/Mage Technique + Form system strike you?<br/><br/>So player A wants to throw a fireball at a bandit in order to kill him. The GM determines that she should use Destroy (Technique) + Fire (Form). Her Destroy is 4 DIce, Her Fire 3 Dice, so she gets 7 Dice to split between effect and control. <br/><br/>If she beats her target number and her control pool exceeds her effect pool she perfectly casts the spell. <br/>If she beats the target number but the effect pool is larger than the control she has a side effect based on the margin by which the effect pool exceeds control. <br/>If she fails to beat the target number and the control pool is greater than the effect pool the spell fizzles. <br/>If she fails to beat the target number and the control pool is less than the effect pool the spell is a dangerous miscast.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430075/#Comment_430075" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T07:05:56+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  7:05AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2014 7:20AM by Rickard.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder what OP thought was the freeform aspect in the magic system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430099/#Comment_430099" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T11:42:50+00:00" title="March 27, 2014 11:42AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Rickard got me right there. It's all a matter of perspective. My game uses fixed Calling aspects that are limited in flexibility. So Anger has only one attached Action: Attack. But what if players could use combinations of Emotions and use them to create flexible spell effects that are related to the domain of the Emotions involved?<br/><br/>Like Love + Anger to arouse someone or Love + Grief to pacify someone.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure how I want to model the effect of magic. What makes it significantly better than just using your natural powers? My Sorcerer Calling allows the player to remove dice from his dice-pool to affect targets at range. That's pretty clearly defined. Still what's the reason to cast a Ritual?<br/><br/>So many questions. But very interesting thoughts so far.

For example, one type of magic (say, fireballs and explosive projectile attacks) might be defined as:<br/><br/>M = (N * H) + D<br/><br/>"Magic points = (Number of characters affected times Hit points of damage) plus Distance to the target."<br/><br/>This is geeky as all shit, now that I look at it.  :-)  But the point was this: Once magic effects are reduced to mathematical functions, <i>they can be processed in either direction</i>.  So, you could tell the GM "I want to do a fireball worth 20 magic points" and the GM will tell you what you get for your 20 magic points.  OR you could say "I want to throw a fireball that engulfs the Evil Mage and his two henchmen (who are standing near each other 8 meters away from me), causing 10 HP of damage each" and the GM can tell you how many magic points it cost you.<br/><br/>Don't know if that helps you or not, but perhaps it will give you other ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430105/#Comment_430105" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T12:01:49+00:00" title="March 27, 2014 12:01PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It helps and brings an interesting perspective to the table.<br/><br/>I think it is neat to have some established rules.

It's all a matter of perspective. My game uses fixed Calling aspects that are limited in flexibility. So Anger has only one attached Action: Attack. But what if players could use combinations of Emotions and use them to create flexible spell effects that are related to the domain of the Emotions involved?<br/><br/>Like Love + Anger to arouse someone or Love + Grief to pacify someone.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure how I want to model the effect of magic.</blockquote>\nSo you want to tie emotions to a system where the user interprets what the feelings are for? I made a magic system where the user could do whatever in a certain area, but I had easier categories like Fire or Illusion. I then had three areas that could be increased, from range (without using a battle grid), duration, to three levels of power. First one was combat and could be used ... well, in combat. To either avoid or dealing damage. The second one was transformation, where the user could give new properties or in other ways change what was affected. The third was the most powerful one: creation.<br/><br/>Fire is pretty straightforward and easy to make up uses for but it's restricted, while illusions is more complex. Because creation is a third level power, to be able to use fire in combat, you needed a source of fire. Good luck finding a source for illusions... Transformation is transforming anything in the environment, and in my game the players could describe as much in the environment as the game master. So fire could almost always be present, if it was logical, but things could also be transformed into illusions. So the third level were never to be used, if the player had the wits for it.<br/><br/>Unless you tie the emotions to different elements, like wood, thunder or the classical Greek elements, I think you will have a hard time creating a magic system that leaves room with interpretation while still be intuitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430141/#Comment_430141" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T00:48:16+00:00" title="March 28, 2014 12:48AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, my Emotion system already allows thematically appropriate actions.

Hopefully.<br/><br/>My game uses Emotions as traits. So building on those associations isn't too much of a stretch.<br/><br/>Anger: Attack, (and Forceful Change)<br/>Joy: Movement, Perception<br/>Love: Cure, (Creation, Gentle Change)<br/>Grief: Defense, (Sympathy)<br/>Fear: Stealth, Evasion, (and general Trickery)<br/><br/>Instead of going with elements, I could instead use the domains of those Emotions in casting. Casting an offensive Spell will surely use Anger, if it is about Perception we will use Joy, and so on. <br/><br/>The question is:<br/>What is covered by mundane uses of the Emotions. (What can be done without magic).<br/>What is the benefit of using Rituals? <br/><br/>Maybe there are special ritual factors that can be bought. Like covering range based on sympathetic connection to the target, rather than meters/yards (as in the Sorcerer Calling). Or casting effects with longer duration than afforded by existing Callings (Witch).<br/><br/>On the other hand, I still think your remark of using Elements is valuable, Rickard. <br/><br/>That's why I'd try to find elements that correspond with the purview of the Emotion.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>The Core system also knows elements, but it uses them differently. I explain it using tiers of complexity:<br/><br/><b>Player uses <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anger</span> to Attack a target.</b> Must stand close to the target, no further effect than damage.<br/><b>Player uses the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sorcerer Calling</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anger</span> to Attack a target.</b> Can now affect a target at range, no further effect.<br/><b>Player uses a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tome of Fire</span> (=Tool) to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attack</span> a target with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sorcerer Calling</span>.</b> The player now is able to set the target on fire if he scores 3 or more hits on his Attack.<br/><br/>Elements come into play through the use of Gear, mostly Tools. Tools activate on a roll with 3+ hits. There are several example conditions established, like Worsening Wound (used for Burns, Bleeding or Acid), Blinding Wounds (reducing Attack and Detect values), Cruel Wounds (interfering with Healing) and Paralyzing Wounds (interfering with Movement/Evasion).<br/><br/>Sorry gotta go<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430144/#Comment_430144" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T02:15:27+00:00" title="March 28, 2014  2:15AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a link to my dev diary with a picture as well.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.grimogre.at/michtim/?p=82" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.grimogre.at/michtim/?p=82</a><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.grimogre.at/michtim/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wound-states2.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430145/#Comment_430145" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T02:28:55+00:00" title="March 28, 2014  2:28AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course this kind of elemental system is damage-centric.
