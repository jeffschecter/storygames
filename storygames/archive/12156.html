Since the landscape and human density is going to change a lot (from a million-person prairie town, through the foothills, then into the mountains, and into the BC fruit country) I kinda hope it will come into it: I'd love for the game to be influenced by the environment, but I guess that will depend on how it shakes out with the other two guys.<br/><br/>My first mix is titled "Dirt Road Drugstore" and it's all grindy blues and alt-country. I had originally planned on making it songs about addiction (because I wanted to try preloading the game) but it didn't end up that focused. Highlights are Tom Waits, Muddy Waters, Headstones, and the Black Keys. The second one is more pop music, and has a lot of force and energy; it's called "Kick Ass and Take Dance Lessons", and it features Hawksley Workman, The Ting-Tings, The Dropkick Murphys, and The Beta Band.<br/><br/>The game can definitely be draining, and we'll see how we feel after the first one, especially since we're going to be leaving after dark and driving through the night... but we need SOMETHING to help us stay awake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272524/#Comment_272524" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-22T19:13:19+00:00" title="May 22, 2010  7:13PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite>My first mix is titled "Dirt Road Drugstore" and it's all grindy blues and alt-country.
