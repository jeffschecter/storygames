It has a simple and functional rotating GM structure, where the GM position rotates by scene (this is actually optional, but rotating by scene, encounter or scenario is highly recommended by the game). One of my favorite bits is where, before you start each scene, the players take turns asking each other questions relevant to the scene, and the answers help flesh out the setting of the scene.<br/><br/>The game also gives you some good fodder for making colorful characters. My character, for example, is a Gentleman Yeti. He has the Beast Form, Cosmopolitan, and Frozen Heart traits. Based on the example characters, the default assumption seems to be relatively human-like PCs, but there's no reason that need be so.<br/><br/>Where the game seems to fall down some is in concrete discussion about connecting the overall premise of the game (becoming an Eidolon and searching for pieces of the Grand Cornerstone) to how that manifests in actual play and what your characters are supposed to be doing. There are plenty of tools given to you, but it's left pretty vague how everything connects together.<br/><br/>I'm still undecided on my feelings about the game's resolution method. It's colorful and ties into the setting, and is in line with the play aesthetic and philosophy of the game, but I haven't found it particularly interesting so far. You basically make draws from an elemental card deck, the composition of which is determined by the nature of the realm you're in currently. There are various degrees of success determined by how close your card draw is in the elemental schema to the element representing the challenge. Your character's various elemental rankings allow for redraws. There are variations and options that can be applied to the basic method.<br/><br/>Character growth/advancement is sort of a group affair, with the other players determining if you embodied a traits behavioral aspects enough to warrant raising it or gaining a new trait that you exhibited. This is tied into the the difficulty of an adventure in a simple but clever way.<br/><br/>The Escalation mechanic is another clever little mechanic. Before handing off the GM role, you draw a couple cards and apply the results to the world in a way that represents those elements. There's a chart to help you interpret how that might look.<br/><br/>My overall impression is that for a game well over 200 pages there should be more focused and explicit talk about how the big picture of being an Eidolon connects to what the characters are doing on a session by session basis. But it's also full of stuff about a cool setting and many tools to help you create within and navigate that setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398608/#Comment_398608" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-24T17:35:35+00:00" title="November 24, 2012  5:35PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2012 5:36PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My character, for example, is a Gentleman Yeti.

I cannot say that I have played a session of Bhaloidam, but I did work my way though the rules and the first example therein.  My step-by-step translation of the example into the rules was posted on the forums with some questions for Corvus.  It wasn't that easy to work my way through that example and I'm a bit concerned that the first example contains a house ruling rather than using the vanilla rules, I would have thought it better to save house rules for a later example.  That said, I think that many of the modern games either take too many pages to describe simple concepts or don't provide good examples.  I would very much like to find the time to play through a sample with the creator in a chat session or play through a session at a convention.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter rewards should be shipping soon, so I hope more actual play postings will be forthcoming <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Mark<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398611/#Comment_398611" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-24T18:55:31+00:00" title="November 24, 2012  6:55PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2012 6:56PM by J_Walton.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a demo of Bhaloidam run by Corvus at Gamestorm, though I wouldn't say it provided a full picture of the game. Bhaloidam's sense of visual design and iconography is utterly fascinating and impressive. The fact that it's a generic game is a bit unfortunate in that there's no setting, character, or situational teeth for these cool images to plug into. Mechanically, it felt similar to me: there's a lot of cool mechanical depth possible and it's surprisingly robust for a relatively simple game, but it still resolves questions like: Who gets the better of who here? Do we do it in time? And since the answers to those questions are also generic rather than infused with a concept or particular flavor, it really relies on the players to do most of the work of interpreting the narrative into the mechanics and then the mechanics back into the narrative. It's possible that I'm just not the right audience for this game (I don't normally dig generic systems) and there's a lot of interesting innovation and incremental learning happening in this game, as Corvus takes a bunch of stuff and distills it into Bhaloidam, but I didn't come away dying to play more of it. I might be more excited if there was a "playset" of some kind that provided more ways for the mechanics to hook into the premise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
