We were down by two due to childbirth and sickness respectively, so three guys played and I observed \u2013 a golden opportunity.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve revised the rules substantially, so this was really a test of new procedures for resolving challenges and observing the dynamic with only one technician per player.  Previous versions had a Lead and a Trainee, which in a three-player game meant six discrete characters interacting across six scenes \u2013 sort of like a circus.  Happily, paring it down works just fine and gives the characters more focus and room to breathe.  It does mean that all six Attitudes and Roles don\u2019t get used, which makes me a tiny bit sad, but not too much.  The other major difference is the addition of Praise, which acts as a sour counterpoint to Blame \u2013 this was Remi\u2019s idea \u2013 too much Praise and you get promoted to assistant manager, which is an even worse fate than being fired.  So the game\u2019s about not being too competent and not being too much of a loser.  It\u2019s a fun dynamic in play.  <br/><br/>The tweaked card mechanic for resolving conflicts seems to work fine, although it needs more testing to poke at edge cases.  We came up with a nice way to handle blind bidding at the top of each service call \u2013 it\u2019s important that none of the players know how many cards the other two are electing to use in the scene, and more cards = more risk.  But there needs to be a practical upper limit to the number of cards you can bid.  So the answer to both of these parameters is to count to three and then show hands \u2013 one finger for each card you want to bid.  The upper limit is a comfortable-but-slightly-dangerous ten, obviously, and there\u2019s no way to know what somebody else will throw.  So that was a great discovery.<br/><br/>I learned that \u201cspecial cards\u201d interact in convoluted and somewhat unexpected ways.  Aces and jokers have specific mechanical effects, and face cards offer players a tactical decision.  In my head I\u2019d always treated these as discrete events, but of course sometimes you get hands with an ace, a joker, and two face cards.  So \u2026 uh \u2026 Blame becomes Praise, and you are suddenly immune to Blame, which makes your technician partner groan, and you get to tweak the degree of success in advance of your opponents reveal.  You have to pay attention, but it\u2019s actually pretty fun.  <br/><br/>For example, at one point Mike, whose technician Susan had a ton of Blame already, found himself in a situation where he was going to take a stack more because Joel and Scott had each played a joker and become immune to Blame.  On his last reveal, he turned over an ace, switching Blame to Praise and saving his bacon.  It was a fun moment.  Susan still had a stack of Praise to deal with, but it was manageable.<br/><br/>We also discovered the fun of having the Client reveal cards one at a time, sort of like a PTA chase scene, to prolong the suspense .<br/><br/>Actual play was also very amusing.  Business Solutions hits so close to people\u2019s actual experience that it has a really joyful vibe filled with recognition and schadenfreude.  The guys chose to play using the \u201cSlice of Life\u201d tone, which is a weirdly popular choice among playtesters.  So we had Susan Wright, a bewildered single parent who needed sympathy, Barbara Wells, a compassionate old timer who needed power, and Jenny Murphy, an enthusiastic ex-con who needed technobedience.  They all played ladies, go figure.<br/><br/>The clients were The First Church of the Rock, Big Joe\u2019s Wrecker Service, and Best Buy store <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2342&amp;Mode=like">#42</a>.  Over the course of the game we learned that Big Joe was, in fact, Susan\u2019s ex-husband (a friendly family member who needed her body, in game terms), and that she\u2019d once attended the Church of the Rock before becoming a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, and that Barbara had a thing for young, stupid men (like Best Buy employee Bren, an unlucky sex object who needed time).  The way Complications (these troublemakers associated with various clients) got incorporated was often very clever.  <br/><br/>In the end poor old Barbara had a whopping 20 Blame, and the shy, confused Susan had 16 Praise.  Susan was reluctantly promoted and forced to fire Barbara, leaving the tough-as-nails ex-felon Jenny as the clear winner.  The game took about two hours to play, which is right on the money as far as I\u2019m concerned.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118936/#Comment_118936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T08:23:33+00:00" title="January 10, 2008  8:23AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Jason.

It's loads better, I think.  One funny thing - it's dirt simple, but the card mechanic introduces about a million more variables and possible conditions that need to be tested against (I'm sure you can relate).  So testing is a little different than what I'm used to.  Lots of "playing all three parts at once" on the kitchen table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
