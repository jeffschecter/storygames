Neither does it fix most problems that your game might have. It is not a replacement for skilled writing, a creative and technical vision, editing, inspiration, or game design work. It is a very specific tool for finding very specific problems, and attempts to use it beyond that are detrimental both to your own game design and to design culture in general.<br/><br/>It is also important when we embark on a playtest that we respect our playtesters' time and attention. Relying on playtest to point out textual, procedural, and mathematical flaws which could be more easily spotted with simple analysis is degrading to our playtesters and also simply bad game design practice. Stop it.</blockquote>\nRead the rest here: <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=565" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=565</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313034/#Comment_313034" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T08:47:09+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  8:47AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2011 8:47AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see some good points in there, but I can't help but get this overall feeling that Ben is killing cockroaches with a missile launcher.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Flaws that are detected decline across the development of a game (consecutive builds) and the type of flaws changes from game breakers to fiddly things like seams in the landscape and improperly textured surfaces in out of the way places. <br/><br/>With RPGs, the process is a bit different.  I agree with Ben that RPGs are what you make them and that unfocused and non-deliberate playtesting is probably a waste of time because compitent players will compensate for the game's failings, obscure them, and then either not report them or not have solutions to the problems.  You should know exactly what you want to get out of a playtest and work to get that information out of the session (e.g. a poorly controlled experiment will not yield useful or meaningful results).  <br/><br/>Regarding "textual" testing, I can see a valid use for crowd-sourcing the editing process for an unfunded project that the designer has not yet decided to invest money in to hire an editor.  As a writer I find that the quality of my writing is a direct function of the number of people I've asked to review my work.  I'm going to also throw out that two types of blind playtesting seem like a really good way to check in and evaluate how your project is coming along.  I think running your game for a totally new group of people is a useful exercise because it gives you more experience explaining the game and seeing how best to convey rules, best practices, and how to answer likely questions in the text before they come up in play.  Alternately, I think there's a use for asking someone else to read your rules, turn on a tape recorder, and play the first session of the game with people who have never played (without you being there).  Being a virtual fly on the wall (listening to the tape) can show you where people have to stop to look up specific rules and what information to emphasize.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313044/#Comment_313044" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T09:52:46+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  9:52AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The stuff about using stats to validate the mechanics is bang on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBen misses an important point about overlong playtest cycles- no amount of polishing can improve a turd. I know I've wasted countless hours on projects that, in all honesty, were never going to be any good. I know plenty of people who have spent huge amounts on time on a pet project, and I haven't had the heart to tell them that it just plain doesn't work, and it would be better to start from the ground up. Wrap it up, kick it out of the door, move onto the next.

I've also seen the confidence and game designers undermined (and had my own confidence undermined) by attempts to playtest games in groups that were already deeply socially dysfunctional. There is a real tendency to imagine that social/personal problems that have nothing to do with the game itself are crippling design flaws. I've seen good games get junked for this very reason. (And I may very well have junked good games myself for this reason, only I'm not about to make claims about the quality of anything I've designed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think often playtesting is a response to personal insecurity or confusion. If you lack confidence about your abilities as a game designer, or if you are afraid your game will be rejected, often playtesting offers a way to reassure yourself or to put off moving forward with your design. "It's not ready yet! Needs more playtesting!" is an excuse that allows you to put off taking bigger steps that frighten you. And, in many games, a new designer may simply not know what to do with a finished design. They may not understand how to polish and publish. They may honestly have no clue what to do next. In this case, playtesting is an alluring answer, because it entails doing something they already understand--playing their game--instead of struggling to do something that they don't, like layout or promotion or sales. (I know I'm definitely guilt on both counts. I have some designs that may very well be finished, but the next step is both frightening and bewildering, so I think, "uh, time to playtest?")<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I think there is a parallel threat to excess playtesting: totally insular game design. I've seen a designer take the philosophy that the process is personal, and refinement is internal to the extreme that he actively hid his game from play, sidestepping all requests by other players to try it. I don't think that game design can happen in a vacuum. (I know Ben isn't saying that it should. I'm just offering a possible alternative extreme.) I don't think that working privately for years on mechanical refinement--as this designer did--is necessarily a good idea. Individuals can have huge personal blind spots, and these blind spots can lead to design that perfect minutiae while leaving large, highly visible portions of the game unpolished.<br/>\n<br/>\nBen offers some really good advice for avoiding this outcome in the article:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Ben%20Lehman">Ben Lehman</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Probably the best idea to to either let the game lie fallow for a bit, or to discuss the issue with trusted fellow designers, members of the target audience, or good friends (ideally: all of the above.)</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThere is one small point that I'd like to quibble with though. Ben advises designers to hire a professional editor. I understand his argument, and I agree that someone who is trained to look at the structure of the text is more qualified to give you textual advice than a group of gamers. However, many first time designers simply can't afford to pay a professional editor, and I wish Ben had offered an alternative suggestion for them. Personally, I plan to ask non-gamer friends to review my text and see if they can understand how the game is played. Of course, this wouldn't resolve grammatical or structural issues, but it will help me know whether my game communicates clearly as a text devoid of context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313046/#Comment_313046" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T09:54:11+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  9:54AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2011 10:04AM by misuba.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>I agree with Ben that RPGs are what you make them and that <b>unfocused and non-deliberate</b> playtesting is probably a waste of time</blockquote>\nThere you go.

They may not provide fully baked answers, but then again I don't usually either. There's a lot of back and forth, sharing of ideas. You know, designing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben</cite>discuss the issue with trusted fellow designers, members of the target audience, or good friends (ideally: all of the above.)</blockquote>\nYeah, that's playtesting too. Depending on how much feedback there is, the last hour of the session might be discussion. It rocks.<br><br>One thing that J-Walt pointed out that I think is true for me as well, I don't approach playtesting all that different from regular gaming. We often end up discussing the design of any game we play, the only reason playtesting is different is because the author is still willing to make changes based on whatever we discuss. So, we play Contenders, and we have some thoughts about the cycle of play, that's it. We play Powers For Good and we have some thoughts about the cycle of play, and I take notes so I can use that information in the next draft. We're still sitting down to play a game with rules and voids and everything.<br><br>I guess what my experience comes down to is: playtest constructively, with people who think analytically.

It's become such a degraded practice that the ENnies recently excluded playtesters from the prohibition on people involved with the creation of a nominee participating.  Why bother, after all, playtesters normally contribute nothing and so much playtesting is garbage that you might as well let them in.<br/><br/>Far, far, FAR more playtesting needs to take place without a designer present. Like, they shouldn't even be in the room. <br/><br/>Sure, social problems or strengths of various groups may distort the testing of your game. It will also distort the playing of your game, so pretty much the only solution is to get many different groups with many different strengths and goals to play your game without any input from you and record the results scrupulously. Nobody, nobody, nobody does this, primarily because nobody is willing to pay for it, primarily because nobody sees any value in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313084/#Comment_313084" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T14:45:40+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  2:45PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Someone who gets editing for free will find that the editing is worth exactly what they paid for it.</blockquote>\nUnless they get free editing from me, like most of the GMing chapter from Blowback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313085/#Comment_313085" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T14:45:52+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  2:45PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the value of playtesting is inversely proportional to the RPG experience of the designer.  <br/><br/>Im a good computer/boardgame designer and I write great mechanics and have nifty ideas, but my couple of RPG attempts have sucked on ice because my experience with what different groups of people do at the table and why, is limited.

Superficially I'm the poster child for what Ben says is bad playtesting, but when I burrow into the details we're on the same page in many places.<br/><br/>I playtested <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/category/microscope/" rel="nofollow">Microscope</a> for two years, putting me squarely on the dark side. I could have released it after one year, and it would have been okay, but instead I kept examining the parts that made me go "hmmm." As a result, I learned some things that I think were pretty fascinating, which opened doors in the game.<br/><br/>One of my reasons for so much playtesting was (ironically) the same as one of Ben's reason for not playtesting: ensuring the intent of the design didn't get watered down in play. Seeing how players drifted unusual aspects of Microscope back towards traditional methods (in other words, when they didn't play the game as I intended, but as they had played other games) was invaluable in figuring out how to prevent it. Players are going to play the game sooner or later (if not playtesting, than after release), so if you can't get them to play the game you intend, skipping playtesting just delays the inevitable.<br/><br/>Comparing Microscope now to the game as-it-would-have-been a year ago, I already know the time was well spent. We'll see if other people agree soon enough. Maybe I wasted a whole year! I could have been down at the pub!<br/><br/><br/>PS There's a big difference between "play and design for fun or art" and "design and sell for profit." If you're charging someone money for something, it's a whole different ballgame. We need a big flag we can wave to distinguish between the two processes. [EDIT and add to that, either way you're asking someone to spend their time on your game. Even if it's 100% free, if you release it you are asking someone to spend their time playing it.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313105/#Comment_313105" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T16:20:30+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  4:20PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2011 4:21PM by mease19.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Someone who gets editing for free will find that the editing is worth exactly what they paid for it.</blockquote>\nI may be deficient but after I get more than about 30 pages into a manuscript, I just can't keep the whole thing in my head anymore and have to work on specific sections in isolation.  Having someone else periodically read through the manuscript with fresh eyes will help you see flaws in your manuscript your brain doesn't even register anymore because you see what you mean rather than the words on the page.  However, what I'm suggesting is more about tightening up your writing and communicating of the system rather than the actual system/mechanics themselves.  This goes back to the deliberate playtesting though - when you've got the system hammered out and are trying to convey it in text then that is the time to give the manuscript to others and ask them what parts are unclear, inconsistent, or out of order (and not a day sooner).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313162/#Comment_313162" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T06:17:40+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  6:17AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kind of wierd having a conversation in two places at once.

It shouldn't be "stop playtesting because you're doing it wrong". It should be "keep playtesting, but here are the things you need to have done first in order to do it right."<br/><br/>Rewrite it like that, and it gets two thumbs up for me.

Maybe no-one is giving them the honest truth they need to hear about their design, cause game design is so different from actual design?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313166/#Comment_313166" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T06:45:51+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  6:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/soullesstees.508774556" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5213/5454765981_c589f5466f.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/soullesstees.508774556" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://images6.cpcache.com/product/508774556v7_480x480_Front_Color-Charcoal.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/>Rob Donoghue tweeted this quote, others requested it as a t-shirt.
