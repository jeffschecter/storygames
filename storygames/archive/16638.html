One hundred years of supply side economics has eradicated poverty and want throughout the United States. The American Dream isn\u2019t just a possibility for everyone; it\u2019s a reality. Every man and woman goes to work wearing a white collar and comes home to a spacious penthouse. They only go hungry when they\u2019re counting calories, and the only oppression they know is a tight deadline.<br/><br/>But still, some are dissatisfied. For them, the paperwork is too demanding, or life in a cubicle is too boring. They need to find an outlet for their stress, or a safe, discrete thrill. They need to get away from themselves, and get off.<br/><br/>They find what they\u2019re looking for in black market virtual reality parlors called empathy dens. Hidden in basements and the backrooms of hobby shops, empathy dens let their clients experience the exotic past and find the freedom and adventure they crave\u2014by living the lives of poor people in the twentieth century on public assistance. By day, they\u2019re the titans of Wall Street, but at night they become</i> Welfare Queens.<br/><br/><i>Welfare Queens</i> is a role-playing game about a not-so-distant future America where white collar professionals spend their nights in back alley arcades, living virtual lives of poverty and desperation. Bored and overwhelmed by their day jobs, the stock brokers, accountants mid level executives of the late 21st century find adventure and catharsis through their experiences as hookers, drug pushers, trailer trash and panhandlers.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/welfarequeens/" rel="nofollow">http://www.miserytourism.com/welfarequeens/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380599/#Comment_380599" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-03T10:03:00+00:00" title="June  3, 2012 10:03AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm reading the .pdf and I'm wondering, "Why are we playing characters who are playing poor people?

So the decision to do those things is a non-decision.</blockquote>\nThe choice isn't so much whether or not to frustrate the characters' dreams or to do the things they never want to do as it is how you ration this humiliation. Each dream can only be frustrated three times in a work week, and you can only do each thing that your character swears they will never do once per week. Since there are five days in a work week, a player who is behaving strategically will avoid blowing all of their humiliation early in the week and will try to figure out which duties they are likely to need the following day so they frustrate the appropriate dream.<br/><br/>Also, since you advance differently based on whether your character has more good days or bad days at work, players might pursue different levels of humiliation to get different results.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>You do this so you can get as many mechanical bonuses during the workday scenes as you can.  Seems like there isnt any mechanical tension between the two phases of play.</blockquote>\nThe game isn't so much about the tension between the two realities as it about how tension in the work world breeds greater and greater indulgence inside the empathy den. As your character advances and accumulates more and more duties, the GM will be rolling more frustration dice and the character will be driven to engage in more desperate, humiliating behavior more frequently in under to compete.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Also, can you explain the rationale for the negative things happening in the den scenes giving positive bonuses during the work scenes?</blockquote>\nSure. It really comes down to blowing off steam. Getting out negative emotions in a safe environment with (apparently) low stakes is a kind of psychological pallet cleansing that lets them face the next work day without the previous day's baggage. There's also a parallel to BDSM and other kinds of masochistic behavior. <br/><br/>There's also the feeling of freedom to experiment with things that seen as are taboo or ugly or wrong or below your rank.  I think this is a lot of the appeal of games like <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>. It's also a lot of the appeal of blackface. And, maybe, role-playing games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380769/#Comment_380769" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T18:27:48+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  6:27PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2012 6:32PM by stefoid.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So humiliation is a resource and the decisions related to the den scenes are resource management?

Like an MMO?  Can the players den-characaters interact?  (I cant even remember if this is a 2 player game, sorry)<br/><br/>but usually in games there is character advancement, so maybe by not failing, you can advance your den character's circumstances to 'the next level', which possibly sets the scenes for even greater fail latter on - like you get double the wrok bonus for a level two den-chaarcter failure.  or something.<br/><br/>And the possibility of den-character interaction means you might be able to frustrate the goals of other den-characters which might make you fel better about yourself in the real world - doing nasty stuff to other characters that you wouldnt dare to do in 'real life'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380770/#Comment_380770" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T18:50:21+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  6:50PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2012 7:08PM by whduryea.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>So humiliation is a resource and the decisions related to the den scenes are resource management?</blockquote>\nYou could absolutely see it that way. If your looking at it from a perspective of pure utility--and I think that fits the theme--yes, that's what's going on. You try to farm enough humiliation--either by frustrating your dreams or doing the things you swear you will never do--to keep your head above water during the next work day.\n<blockquote>How does play go when you decide not to humiliate?  Is it pure narration of non-humiliating scenes?</blockquote>\nWhether or not you decide to engage in humiliating behavior, the empathy den scenes are purely freeform, meaning you either freely narrate or act out your dialogue or actions. These sections are supposed to feel like the free play mode of a video game, where everything is open to you and you do what you want, how you want, or being at an amusement park where the GM provides the rides but you decide which roller coasters you can handle.<br/><br/>I kept the mechanics in those scenes near nonexistent intentionally to keep the contrast between the empathy den scenes and work day scenes high. I can understand that there are a lot of people who don't dig the lack of structure and mechanical motivation in freeform, but I had a lot of fun stirring up trouble (OK, trolling) in freeform chat sites like The Keep and Wizards' ISRP rooms back in the day and I thought that kind of unrestricted freedom to screw around fit my personal vision for the game. \n<blockquote>It feels like that could fall a little flat, like there should be something else happening where the the choice  to go for your alter-egos goal or to frustrate it is more than resource management.  something more conseqential.</blockquote>\nThis didn't happen during our playtests, but I can see how this is a legitimate concern. The only way to know for sure is probably more playtesting with new groups.<br/><br/>One thing that, theoretically, should keep the game from getting too stagnant in the long term is the way that advancement works. Every time you get a new Dream/Duty, the GM gets one more frustration die for you per turn, meaning you are going to have to humiliate your character more and more times per day to keep up. This should become a icky downward spiral of increasingly garish nastiness. Of course, that might burn your players out too. But I wouldn't mind if people bail on the game after a few session for that reason. In fact, becoming burnt out or strung out eventually is intentional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
