Awesome. They've also really gotten into Game of Thrones recently and expressed interest in playing in Westeros. Extra awesome. Here's the situation, though:<br/><br/>1) One of them played D&amp;D in his teens, one of them played a couple of sessions in her teens with her brother and his friends, and one's never played at all.<br/>2) They hate combat-dominated role-playing.<br/>3) Aside from the the house generation rules (which I LOVE), I hate the Song of Ice and Fire RPG.<br/>4) There is a need to keep the rules simple.<br/><br/>I am perfectly willing to hack Westeros into an appropriate system, but does anyone have any ideas as to what that might be? Something relatively easy but with a set of rules that encourages Machiavellian interplay?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340586/#Comment_340586" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T07:23:33+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  7:23AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do they want to compete against each other to see who will become king?<br/><br/>Do they want to be all on the same team (part of the same house or family)? <br/><br/>What part of combat-dominated role-playing do they dislike?

The combat is fast and descriptive, the story is in the forefront.

So, why I don't have a direct answer I have put some thought into it.<br/><br/>If you like parts of Song of Ice and Fire rpg and Fate one option would be to use Wheel of Fate which has a similar system of roll and keep d6s and add them together. You also get aspects. Skills are determined by the GM and can be tuned to the setting so you could borrow the essential skills from SoIaF rpg.<br/><a href="http://evilhat.wikidot.com/wheel-of-fate" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://evilhat.wikidot.com/wheel-of-fate</a><br/><br/>If you like house creation but think it is too complex the group rules from Reign work really well and can basically be applied to just about any game. We used them for a D&amp;D4 game.<br/><br/>Houses of the Blooded probably comes closest to a SoIaF game. It would be fun to try and figure out which houses are associated with which traits or you could just leave that open. Houses probably lends itself best to Machiavellian roleplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340596/#Comment_340596" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T08:29:43+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  8:29AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone put together a Burning Wheel scenario for Song of Fire and Ice <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Sons_of_the_Watch" rel="nofollow">Sons of the Watch</a>  . That might give you and your players some ideas for running Game of Thrones. I think you can just stick to the first 72 pages of BWR so run the game until the players call for more.<br/><br/>Reign would also be a possibility (with the company rules for the house) along with Solar System<br/><br/>A lighter set of rules that might work would be Risus. You can engage in a wide change of tasks with your tags. Plus both GM and players can tag things and then use those tags. <br/><br/>A Lady Blackbird hack would do justice to this as well.

Run it as a separate intro game if you want, but don't try basing a campaign around it.<br/><br/>That said, BWG might be a good fit.  Yes, yes, BW is all crunchy... but not really.  Don't use the subsystems until you're ready.  Plus, there's basically no magic in Westeros (the only characters who seem to have true Faith are Thoros and Melisandre), so there's even less complexity.<br/><br/>Also, Fight! and Range and Cover are really only for major engagements.  Everything else is a versus test or bloody versus.  If you really stick to that, BW is not a very complex game.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340642/#Comment_340642" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T12:45:05+00:00" title="August 26, 2011 12:45PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can lend you a copy of PTA if you'd like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340643/#Comment_340643" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T13:06:08+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  1:06PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone: That would be awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340651/#Comment_340651" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T13:54:14+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  1:54PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prince Valiant!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340655/#Comment_340655" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T14:37:55+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  2:37PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2011 4:48PM by ivan.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco! of course!

It was fairly light on system-specific rules (although we did use the licensed game's character creation). I think what makes a game "feel" like Westeros is partly a fairly complex background story that the players get to unravel as they play and characters who are willing to be grimly pragmatic when the situation demands it.<br/><br/>I'd suggest riffing off of Dogs' town creation for the game's history (possibly developing it further should the game be more than a one-shot affair). As a GM I think it's important to hit the right notes when it comes to the setting, to encourage the kind of uncomfortable compromises that the characters are forced to make. So that means keeping in mind the inherent injustice and accepted cruelty of the setting, as well as the power-hungry nature of most principal characters. Westeros is an ugly and - as others have noted - an ignoble place. <br/><br/>I'd also suggest giving the characters one strong and driving goal, that they should strive to hit again and again. Although I'd shy away from hard-wiring it into the rules. Something like a reasonably long-term Kicker (from Sorcerer) might do the trick.

Because LoA was exactly what I was going to suggest when I clicked on this thread. If you want to play out the macro struggles between the houses, Chapter Fourteen on creating and playing organizations and Chapter Sixteen on mass warfare deserve a careful read. (Though I plan to streamline the heck out of these rules before I use them.) And yes, Aspects would be a great way to recreate the allegiances, complexities, flaws, and tragic mistakes that make ASoIaF so compelling. That said, LoA is somewhat crunchy with fiddly special rules and exceptions, and as such might not meet the OP's criteria.\n<blockquote>That said, I'd probably use Prime Time Adventures too -- especially if all the characters are members of one household, the way PTA handles relationships and Issues would be totally sweet.</blockquote>\nYeah that would work, but the season structure does diminish the deadliness of the fiction somewhat, as all the main characters basically have plot immunity until the season finale. If that's all right with the group it's definitely a good fit, and it may well fit because all the major deaths seem to happen at the end of the books.<br/><br/>In a Wicked Age is interesting, but would require an Oracle deck. There are probably some appropriate ones over at the random generation wiki, and creating one shouldn't be too hard either.<br/><br/>Fiasco would work, since there's already a playset too, as long as the players are not pre-set on playing particular characters.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird--well who doesn't love Lady Blackbird? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> As long as it's a game where the PCs can reasonably stick together like the Night's Watch game mentioned above, it should be great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340821/#Comment_340821" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T09:21:05+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  9:21AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2011 9:21AM by lachek.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I hacked together the beginnings of a system last night combining parts of Mouse Guard, Smallville, Apocalypse World, and the Battlestar Galactica board game.

I was drooling over that game until I bought it and realized the "Game of Thrones" game mode (with the players / protagonists vying for power) was relegated to a short paragraph towards the end basically stating "sure, you can play this way, if you want" with no instructions on how to do it and the rest of the book reading like any d20 Fantasy supplement: lots of setting material, stats, and task-resolutiony type stuff, with no rules for anything related to higher-order power struggles. It makes a nice coffee-table book, but as far as I can tell it's completely unplayable if you truly want aSoIaF fiction. I ended up hacking together its setting material, expanded and customized Groups mechanics from REIGN, and some components from the AGoT board game to make a play-by-email game with strategy and roleplaying elements, but it got stuck in the too-complex phase a few years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340888/#Comment_340888" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T17:32:50+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  5:32PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Interesting, Matthew.

We were playing a Night's Watchmen murder mystery in King's Landing and it worked well for our purposes.  That particular group was/is very d20-centric so possibly more-fitting alternatives were not really on the table.
