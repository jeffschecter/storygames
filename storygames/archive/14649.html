Most of the time, it takes a little while to get a feel for an NPC, maybe they're pretty bland at first but as they get more screen time we learn more about them, and it's easier to play them. That first little while is PAINFUL though. Other times, you start playing this character and they just come alive. They seem to be just bursting to get out into the game, their dialogue comes easily, and they're a joy to play. What's more, everyone loves meeting them, and they make the whole game better.<br/><br/>How do I get more of that? <br/><br/>What I've found is that these characters often have some things in common, or there are some traits that make a character easier to play. I've found a few, but I bet you all have found others. Here are ones I've found:<br/><br/>Honesty: NPCs who say what everyone's thinking, who lay their cards out plainly, or who are aware and unashamed of their place in the world are easy and fun to play. You can just say what's on your mind, and it comes out as honest and refreshing.<br/><br/>Mannerisms: Sometimes a character has a distinctive mannerism, and as soon as you do that one thing, you've got the character fixed and you can play themm. In an apocalypse world game I ran, the holder of the town held court in a library. Every time someone spoke to her, the conversation would start with her taking off her reading glasses, and saying something about the book she was reading. Usually the books would be something funny or incongruous. She liked Harlequin romances "For all the fucking".<br/><br/>Goals: Characters with clear goals are easier to play than characters with complex or hidden goals. It's hard when you have to decide how much a character wants one thing compared to something else, or decide what compromises they're willing to make.<br/><br/>What else have you all found makes an NPC easy and fun to play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333241/#Comment_333241" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T17:05:10+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  5:05PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a face to face games, body language helps.  It pretty much falls in the mannerism group, but it does give the GM another channel from transmitting information to the players and it can also give the GM a mnemonic for that NPC.  Props were mentioned in another thread, but these can also be NPC hooks.  For example, when the GM holds the crystal orb everyone at the table knows that its the Old Crone speaking.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333247/#Comment_333247" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T17:27:25+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  5:27PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 5:29PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, the easiest NPCs to play are a lot like the easiest PCs for me to play.  They tend to be fast-talking, clever, lower-class schemers; basically, it's a lot of cheap con artists, burnouts, and dilettantes.  They're sarcastic jerks who secretly want to be the good guy, they tend to be pop-culture savvy, and they love people who can snark right back at them and hate people who use power/authority against them.  Their goals tend to be short-sighted and they frequently sabotage their own plans by mouthing off at the wrong moment.  I can play endless variations on these themes, and have an absolute blast doing it; dialogue and decisions for those characters come so easily that I'm almost never at a loss for what to do with them.<br/><br/>I should note, though, that these are usually not the NPCs that our group thinks are awesome; they're just the easiest for me to play.  I have to step outside that comfort zone in order to really impress anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb" title="AusJeb"><img alt="AusJeb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb">AusJeb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333250/#Comment_333250" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T17:46:35+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  5:46PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently came across a suggestion of having a portrait for each NPC that you can hold up when the NPC is talking so that the players can more readily discern who is who in the campaign.

It's a good way of articulating what I was trying to get at with the quoted text.<br/><br/>I think it's also easier to play a character when you're not worrying about how much of their plans/intentions to reveal. Hidden information makes characters harder to play, I think.<br/><br/>A few people have talked about ways of making NPCs distinctive to the players - that's interesting and useful stuff, but not what I'm after here. I want to hear more about what makes an NPC easy and fun for the GM.<br/><br/>I'm also interested in games that have rules that help you do this. Steve Hickey's "Left Coast" has some neat ideas for this, and Apocalypse World has its "Make your characters not that complicated".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333263/#Comment_333263" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T18:45:58+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  6:45PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 6:47PM by stefoid.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my game I encourage making NPCs using the PC gen rules, scoped to the NPCs importance.  i.e. give more or less detail depending...<br/><br/>The main part of that is <b>motivations </b>and a <b>goal</b>, where the motivations can be abstract but the goal has to be concrete.  (motivations can lead to goals)<br/><br/>The motivations consist of at least one of each of the following (for PCs).  For NPCs, you can be selective, but thinking about each type of motivation helps, even if you dont commit to each.<br/><br/>BELIEF: What is the character like to act on?<br/>DESIRE: What is the character likely to pursue?<br/>ISSUE: What is likely to make the character react emotionally?<br/>INFLUENCE: What is likely to restrict or constrain the character?<br/>DISPOSITION: How does the character feel about another character?<br/><br/>So armed with the above information, it should be a lot easier for you to blurt out consistent reactions to situations for an NPC, even if those reactions dont make sense with the info that the PCs have available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
