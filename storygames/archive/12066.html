Basically, a relationship in a game only works if the player develops it himself, not if it's pre-set.<br/><br/>However, with RPGs there are some interesting counterpoints...first of all, we make our own characters, our own protagonists.<br/><br/>If Infamous tells me I should care about my sister, but I don't, that sucks. However if I made that character and decided he cares about his sister, I probably did it for a reason. Flags and all that.<br/><br/>Second of all, yeah, it works better when you meet the NPC at the same time as the protagonist does. But then, in a videogame, again, the choice whether the protagonist is going to bond with that character or not is left to the game. In a RPG, the choice is the player's.<br/><br/>So it doesn't fully apply.

Like, sure, <i>I</i> can't cast spells, but in a game I can have character act like they can; <i>I</i> don't give a crap about my characters fictional kidnapped sister, but I can have the character act like they do, cuz that's what you do to have fun in that game.Of course long-term play will generate stronger attachments, and some fictional relationships are stronger than others for a variety of reasons.

In my last Dogs game, I had a player write up a few sentences about an NPC he didn't like, and why. When I had the NPC show up in play, the character felt such intense hatred towards him that they nearly killed each other in the very first scene where he was introduced. The NPC ended up dead; the player character barely survived the experience. But it was clear that for this player defeating this other guy who had just showed up in play for the first time was so important he was willing to lose his character over it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270248/#Comment_270248" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T10:41:00+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 10:41AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Nathan.

I've found that a lot of gamers have been burned in the past by either simply having that material ignored ("Hey GM, my character's all about his sister's pending marriage to man he disapproves of!"  GM: "That's great, so you all meet in a bar....") or abused ("Hey GM, my character has an autistic daughter and it's putting stress on her marriage...", GM: "So you come home to find you husband and daughter murdered....").  The result is that these people learn to stop investing.  When they are asked to create material like that, they do so because they "have to" and then they fabricate something that they know is emotionally safe and that they can stand a safe distance from.<br/><br/>I absolutely agree with the basic premise that just listing relationships is not enough.  They have to mean something to you out of the gate and that requires a bit of honesty and self-reflection.  I also think having those relationships questioned, challenged and re-evaluated mid-play is perfectly fine and indeed a great idea.<br/><br/>On the other hand, maybe I'm just easily emotionally imaginative.  I created a character who had a lost love in his back story in the Diaspora game I'm playing now.  The GM (knowing me very well) had her show up.  He played her as a bit distant perhaps barely remembering me.  I felt really bad for my character.  I can easily imagine and empathize with having your illusions shattered like that.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270252/#Comment_270252" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T10:45:56+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 10:45AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>If that changes over the course of play and I end up helping him keep our sister in chains that is not problematic, that is awesome.

It's actually why I think one of the most overlooked and under appreciated aspects of Burning Wheel is the fact that you get rewarded for acting both in accordance with *and against* your Belief.  Beliefs then become a thematic pivot around which the character turns rather than a rope the GM can pull on to make sure the character moves in an expected direction.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270257/#Comment_270257" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T11:01:59+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 11:01AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that part of this is that there's an art to creating prefab "in-character motivations" that map to "situations that will eventually excite the player."

I'll often make characters with attachments to diametrically opposed things (NPCs, groups, whatever) because, for me, my characters struggle to satisfy multiple masters is usually really interesting and gripping. I think a good strategy is maybe to point your character towards stuff that you already know that you're into, and then being open to those relationships and links changing over the course of the game. Even if you don't find a new situation that you like, you'll at least have your default to engage with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270265/#Comment_270265" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T11:26:26+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 11:26AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on, Clint.<br/><br/>I'll point to Montesgur 1244 as a game that strongly front-loads relationships and motivations as well as tightly constraining the game's scope and arc.

Like utterly, utterly wrong. (And I think he mixes up sympathy with empathy. For ease of reading, I say empathy when I mean a direct overlap of emotions between myself and somebody else. And I say sympathy when I mean a imagined construct of what somebody else must be feeling.)<br/><br/>When he says that in a game I need to care about the secondary characters the way the protagonist does, I just shake my head. That's like saying I need to feel I am looking at real lava to worry about my protagonist falling into it and dieing. It's completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>I do think though that roleplaying games can succeed in the kind of thing he seems to argue for, but mostly because of their very flexible nature. I think we react and connect with fictional characters because certain details, certain contexts and descriptions are recognisable and ring true to us, personally, and trigger the kind of reaction that goes beyond mere sympathy to explicit empathy. <br/><br/>And with RPGs in general, and Story Games in particular, you can do that. You can develop the kind of personalised character, context and situation that makes you able to feel as the fictional character. In fact I think that many gamers naturally gravitate towards that kind of gaming experience. Most gamers want to empathise with their characters. Which is one of the reasons why games where you might play far outside your comfort zone (e.g. violent bastard pirates or subservient housemaids) feel squicky and weird to some gamers. They naturally assume that character empathy is the goal of every gamer. <br/><br/>The fun thing about RPGs is, that you start off sympathising (as in imagining) what your character is going through and - if the game is as well-tuned to your personality as most honestly-played games tend to become - you find the distance between your character's emotions and your own disappearing. That is if you let it occur. Meaning the player's compliance is the last and final (but far from the only) barrier that keeps you from empathising with a character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
