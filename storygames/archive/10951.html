In some cases, there is a pure feeling of relish. "You are really screwing with my character. This will be great to watch." In other cases, it's "You are really screwing with my character, you bastard." In the latter case, you might even be annoyed with the source of the adversity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like both types of conflict, but I prefer the second. For example, I was playing in a Dr Who game at IndieCon. One of the characters was a ringer. As a player I knew this fairly early on, but didn't act on it, as my character would not have done so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ringer did things I considered to be in the first category. "Ha! You are are so screwing with everyone, and don't I know it!" But then, in the midst of another conflict, that player signalled to the GM and clocked my character over the head with a pipe. It was a big surprise. This was definitely in the second category. I was momentarily annoyed, but I enjoyed the conflict much more as a result. In other words, I particularlyl like a bit of player competitiveness/conflict mixed in with character conflict. However, this is a little more dangerous, as it can lead to players becoming seriously annoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich type of conflict do you prefer, assuming you even accept the distinction?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242991/#Comment_242991" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T06:32:55+00:00" title="November 21, 2009  6:32AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>In games, people will set up conflicts for your character.

Whereas the "you bastard" response suggests that you are more immersed in the character (who would be annoyed, though you are again enjoying the conflict).<br/><br/>Or am I way off base here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242994/#Comment_242994" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T07:04:22+00:00" title="November 21, 2009  7:04AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, I think my play tends toward a bit of detachment, with real enthusiasm for the overall story at the expense (when necessary) of individual characters.

I think a lot of trad gamers would just say "suck it up." I did see a clash of cultures in such a situation where a character shot another character (not unreasonably) without even looking at the player (whom he didn't know). The first player, from an indie games background was conditioned to expect "My character, I think, in this situation, would shoot your character. Are you OK with that?" and was mortified.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243022/#Comment_243022" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T11:19:01+00:00" title="November 21, 2009 11:19AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, is this about character advocacy?
