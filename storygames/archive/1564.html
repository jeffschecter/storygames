                    So over there in "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1563" rel="nofollow">What you've already learned from people here</a>" I said:
<blockquote>I've learned that die mechanics should "reinforce and emphasize" other aspects of the game from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1528&amp;page=1#Item_17" rel="nofollow">Dreampod</a>.</blockquote>
The reason I mentioned that is that it gave me this idea.<br/><br/>You have one die at any given time that you roll for all conflicts. It represents your "power" â€“ depending on your setting, you might call it mojo, repute, cool, badassity or whatever.<br/><br/>This die can be a d4, d6, d8, d10 or d12. You start out with a d4. You get bigger dice by defeating challenges (monsters, opponents, circumstances) which have bigger dice than you do. <br/><br/>How do you beat someone with a bigger die? Well, the formula for the average result of a die of x sides is (x + 1)/2, which means, among other things, that the difference in average roll between dice that differ in size by 2 sides is not 2, as you might think, but 1. (A d4 roll averages 2.5, a d6 3.5.)<br/><br/>So you have attributes (or traits, or whatever you want to call them) which "bump" your dice, and if you have more attributes than your opponent, then you can quite readily take on an opponent with a bigger die and have a reasonable expectation of winning. You get to use the attributes by including them in your narration.<br/><br/>So: There's obvious character progression. It's visible and tangible (literally; you can pick it up and roll it.) And you're Jack the Giant Killer. You're regularly taking on more powerful opponents and winning, because your character is more interesting than theirs (has more attributes). This is why I call this the "underdog dice system" (no connection with Dogs in the Vineyard).<br/><br/>I have a couple more rules in mind. Employing attributes uses them up, either in a "pool of points" kind of sense or like in the Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries, where you have to cycle through them before you can use them again. <br/><br/>You get more attributes (and maybe get to refresh your attributes so you can use them again) when you're defeated by a stronger opponent (one with a bigger die). You get to "power up" your attributes when you defeat a stronger opponent. So both winning and losing benefits you in different ways. Someone who hasn't lost much is actually at a disadvantage (and is likely to lose); someone who's lost a lot is in a better position to win. <br/><br/>Lots of motivation for conflict and tension and lots of opportunity for reverses of fortune.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of developing this a little further, but anyone is welcome to it if it fits with a project you have.                </div>

                            What if instead of attributes you consume, you have Chekov's Guns.  In other words, if you pick up some magic beans, a silver needle, and a blue handkerchief, then later you can use each of them once for a bump - by planting them to grow a beanstalk, stabbing the giant in the foot, and throwing the handkerchief behind you to make a lake.                        </div>

                            Oh, things you own are totally attributes, just as much as things you are and things you feel and things you know and things you can do.                        </div>

                            I like it!  anything that has a bigger die-type than you, at least ina vacuum, is a challenge to be overcome.  Becaus eif all things were on equal footing, then the larger die type would be more likely to be the victor.<br/>
<br/>
It's a very cool way to handle degrees of power in the game and give the gusto to those that have the will (as ead in attributes) to triumph.<br/>
<br/>
So I guees I'm not saying anything that would actually be helpful other than I like your idea very much.                        </div>

                            That's helpful - thanks, Victor.<br/><br/>Yes, the bigger die is totally bait. "Something more powerful than us! Cool, let's attack it!"                        </div>

                            OK, further thoughts:<br/><br/>Your character sheet contains a 6 high x 12 wide grid with boxes large enough for poker chips or similar. Each column represents an attribute (and has the name of the attribute written above it). <br/><br/>You start out with a d4, four attributes, four points and four chips. You put the points into the attributes by marking four of the boxes (I like the idea of using an in-theme rubber stamp for this for some reason) to indicate the maximum in the pool for that attribute. You can't have points in any one attribute which total more than half the number of sides your die has (so, no more than two for any one attribute to start out with). You put the chips on top of the marks.<br/><br/>Whenever you bump your die, you spend chips off your layout by narrating the use of the related attributes. If you spend a lot of chips you should narrate using the attribute in some extreme way. Once you are out of chips in an attribute you can't use it again until you recharge it.<br/><br/>You roll first and bump afterwards. You can't bump a die to a number greater than its maximum (so if you are d4 and your opponent is d6 and rolls a 5 or a 6, you have lost automatically). <br/><br/>What does this do to the narration, since there's then no point in invoking attributes? Perhaps the sequence should go: <br/><br/>1.	Nominate attributes to use. <br/>2.	Roll.<br/>3.	Bump if need be, but narrate use of the attributes in any case. <br/><br/>Because bumping involves spending chips, and you know before the roll what the maximum number of chips to be spent on each side is, it becomes a bit strategic â€“ and you're not actually obligated to spend the chips, so you can go back-and-forth a bit: <br/><br/>"I'll spend my two chips from 'Can't Stand a Smartass', which puts me in the lead." <br/>"OK, then, I'll spend my three chips from 'Endearing Personality'. You still have two in 'Big Furry Hat', you gonna spend those?"<br/>"Um, no, never mind, you win, I'll keep my five chips, I might need them later."<br/><br/>When you defeat an opponent with a larger die, you swap die sizes (and likewise when an opponent with a smaller die defeats you). You also get the same number of points as your margin of victory over the opponent, and you mark these on your layout, increasing the maximum size of your pools. You can still only have a total of half the number of sides on your die as your maximum in any one pool. If there are points left over they go into a pile of tokens off to one side that you can use later, or maybe use to create attributes in the fictional environment.<br/><br/>When you lose to an opponent with a larger die, you get to add an attribute if you have room for one. You may only have as many attributes as you have die sides (you don't lose them, and your pool maximum doesn't decrease, when you are forced down to a smaller die).<br/><br/>The margin of defeat when you are beaten by a larger opponent is given to you as chips and recharges your pools. Again, if you have more than you can use you can store them up to use later. I suspect there will need to be another way to recharge the pools as well, besides going around looking for a challenge to lose. <br/><br/>I'm not sure yet what should happen if you beat someone weaker or equal to you (or lose to someone equal). Maybe it shouldn't matter the size of the opponent; winning gets you points to increase your maxima, losing refreshes your pools. But adding attributes only happens if you lose to a bigger opponent, and swapping die sizes only if the winner is the one with the smaller die.<br/><br/>Margins of victory and defeat should perhaps be those before the dice were bumped. If bumping the dice changes the outcome, the difference between the high roll and the low roll is still the margin, but which person gets which thing changes.<br/><br/>Of course, you have stakes and counterstakes for your challenges as well. For preference (thanks, Hamsterprophet) the counterstakes shouldn't simply be the reverse of the stakes but something which sets up a new situation or challenge.                        </div>

                            Yes, I am. I'm also currently considering linking it up with my "X's attribute Y and how I feel about it."<br/><br/>My tentative thinking at the moment on the modular game system is to provide several resolution systems with different flavours, so that you can pick the one which best suits how you want to play. This is probably a really bad idea, though, for anything except a "design demo" game to show how different design decisions work out. If anyone wants to convince me otherwise, please do.                        </div>
