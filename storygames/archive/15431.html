I've always been terrible at the arts and crafts aspects of gaming.<br/><br/>I need 4 PCs minis and decent numbers of minis for NPCs (though I don't mind if the latter are less differentiated/cool), and reasonable grid maps for a large-ish number of in-game locations.<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349995/#Comment_349995" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T19:54:33+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  7:54PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Easiest way to make maps is to let others do it for you, if you can adapt your content to the maps.  rpgmapshare.com and cartographersguild.com are good sources.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350003/#Comment_350003" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T22:56:06+00:00" title="November 29, 2011 10:56PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 to Cartographer's Guild.

Then I'd have players describe the house their characters grow in, inmediate neighbours and place them in the map first. Then, the 3 places they visited the most when they were kids (like where did they play, where did they had to go for errands and where were they sent to learn things, either lore or a skill.) and people they knew in those places. Essentially, let players draw the map, so they get familiar / invest emotions or creative input in the place their characters are going to protect. That way you can have players actually care about the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350151/#Comment_350151" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T12:15:49+00:00" title="December  1, 2011 12:15PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2011 1:00PM by johnzo.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As WarriorMonk says, for fast production of figs, don't use minis, use tokens.  Everything is easier when your figures don't have to stand up on their own.  <br/><br/>To give your tokens extra heft, tape a coin or poker chip or washer or something heavy to their underside; it makes them much easier to handle and less prone to fly away.<br/><br/>Also, google image search is your very best friend for sourcing art.  I find that simple cartoony line art -- <a href="http://www.fantasygamesunlimited.net/CHESS%20counters.pdf" rel="nofollow">like you see on these V&amp;V counters</a> -- is the best for these.<br/><br/>I don't like the D&amp;D4E tokens you get in their monster box sets right now, the artwork is too busy and so you really have to squint at the token to see what it is.<br/><br/>Be sure to print a unique text label on each token so you can distinguish Goblin A from Goblin Q.<br/><br/>If you want to put a little bit more work in and get some very nice-looking cardstock figures, have a look at <a href="http://www.gwindel.eu/Autre/Figs/Figurines.html" rel="nofollow">Patrick Cruciau's cardboard figures.</a>  I've run countless sessions using Patrick's art.  He is a hero of the light.<br/><br/>Also, it's excellent to see that you're pre-making your maps.  It's super irritating to have to pause the game for a stretch while the DM draws the map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350164/#Comment_350164" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T12:53:43+00:00" title="December  1, 2011 12:53PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A neat trick I saw used at a convention recently for quick minis.<br/><br/>The GM used wooden Lincoln Logs.
