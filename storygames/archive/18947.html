I thought it would be much easier to just have the GM section in a book and that's it. All the PC stuff is on the character sheets, and I mostly run prepared dungeons (or Dungeon Planet stuff) so I have monsters in my prep already.<br/><br/>So I made <b>Truncheon World</b>, a 128 page 6x9 book with just the GM sections and the rules I might want to reference when running the game. I mostly re-ordered things and put rules together in a way that makes sense to me, although I added the concept of dungeon fronts from Lair of the Unknown and a list of questions and situations for each of the character classes that GMs can use to get things going. I also did some nice-looking layout for it, complete with flowery dingbats around the edges and crap, and got a B&amp;W version from Lulu. I thought it would be nice to have the dingbat stuff colour-coded by section, so it's easier to find stuff, and I'm waiting to see what Lightning Source sends me based on that file. I also made a half-letter sized pdf without the flowery dingbats.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm looking for input as to if and how I should make these available to other peoples.<br/><br/><b>Things I DO want:</b><br/>-- I wanted a small book version of the rules. Now I have that, rock on.<br/>-- I want to make this available to anybody else who wants one. A few people expressed interest when I first mentioend it in passing, so why shouldn't they have one, too?<br/>-- It would also be nice to get paid a few bucks for the editing and layout work.<br/><br/><b>Things I DON'T want:</b><br/>-- I'm not looking to replace the DW rulebook. I don't want anybody grabbing this version and the free character sheets and then using the Codex just because it's cheaper than buying DW (I'm trying to ride some coat-tails here, not take the coat for myself, if you know what I mean). People should pick up Truncheon World if they already have DW and also want a slimmer reference volume.<br/><br/>So, if you are interested in this, what do you think I should do?<br/>Should I even bother releasing a pdf? Or just a print version?<br/>Should I make it cheap? Or should I price it so that it's not an attractive alternative to buying DW in print? Which one do you think works best for Sage and Adam?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tw_pic_collection.jpg"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423477/#Comment_423477" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T23:14:21+00:00" title="October 28, 2013 11:14PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That looks great, Johnstone!

I get how that improves portability, but for ease of reference at the table, I'd want to go <i>much</i> farther, more like 28 pages than 128.  Perhaps two books, one of "stuff I want for almost every session" and one of "stuff that I might need at any given session, but don't use every time"?<br/><br/>I'd be happy to look it over and tell you what I'd keep as "core" if that's helpful to you.  It'll just be my opinion, though, and I am no Dungeon World expert.<br/><br/>As for sales, I have not bought DW, and do not plan to shell out big bucks for it soon (more due to poverty than lack of interest), but I might pay a cheap price for a small book that's rich with GM tools.  The best chance for Sage &amp; Adam to make a sale off me is if I am blown away by the cheap (or free) GM book, and develop a craving for more (though that's admittedly a long shot).<br/><br/>Hope this serves as a useful data point!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423505/#Comment_423505" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T15:05:02+00:00" title="October 29, 2013  3:05PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was really hoping Truncheon World was going to be a supplement for playing Discworld-style city watch characters.<br/>Could somebody write that?
