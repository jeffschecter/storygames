My limited experience since (one play each) with How We Came to Live Here, Primetime Adventures, Shock:, Camel's Egg and Ganakagok has been that when I do have a premise I'm pumped to address, the game rocks, and when I don't, it doesn't.  <br/><br/>Tomorow (tonight) I'll be playing Dogs in the Vineyard for the first time (thanks, jenskot!).  I own the book, and am familiar with the basic genre, so I started thinking, "What might I get pumped about within that?"  And then my brain instantly ignored the genre and quoted Bill Adama, in BSG Season 2, when he (SPOILER ALERT) cancels his order to kill Admiral Cain by saying, "It's not enough to survive.  We should be <i>worthy</i> of survival."<br/><br/>In context, it was just brilliant, as Admiral Cain was a master of "survive by any means necessary."<br/><br/>Who's right?  Okay, now make the survival question about the <i>whole human race</i>.  Who's right <i>now</i>?<br/><br/><i>That's</i> some premise I'd like to address right there.  I imagine many of y'all will agree.  So.  What game would you use?  (With or without the "whole human race" thing.  The girl in the cell in V for Vendetta works just as well.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182557/#Comment_182557" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T03:47:11+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  3:47AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played the new BSG board game last night and have to say that the game is full of the tough decisions and you face long odds of winning. <br/><br/>I was Tigh, and at one point was convinced that Adama was a cylon.

If it doesn't fit the bill, please tell us why.<br/><br/>-Grant</blockquote>\nOkay - after a quick speed read of Battlestar Galactica I've got a few findings.<br/><br/>It\u2019s a well presented traditional roleplaying game based on the very early part of Battlestar Galactica. The opening introduction, most of the background, the series history and the whole character generation section was clearly written by someone who had only seen the Mini-series, however the rules examples are based on various episode during the season, and the inclusion of stats for the Number 8 Cylon shows they got as far as the end of season one (but clearly didn\u2019t have chance to revise much of the book in light of various revelations during the season). <br/><br/>The descriptions of the twelve colonies are definitely in need of review. They have issues like the entry for Caprica talking about how Capricans have trouble doing well in the Navy, whilst the series has made it clear that Capricans are overly represented amongst the officers. Also the section on the Medical School on Gemini made me laugh (in the series it has been established that the Geminon oppose modern medicine on religious grounds). <br/><br/>Character Generation is a fairly traditional point based system. Players are given three budgets - one for attributes, one for skills and one for "assets and complications\u201d (Advantages and Disadvantages). The attributes are pretty much the 6 d20 defaults renamed and reordered. Attributes, Skills, Assets and Complications are all rated in terms of the number of dice you roll (so for example a Rookie pilot might have a skill as low are d2 whilst a exceptional pilot might have d12 or more). <br/><br/>The rules are fairly simple. I have concerns about the effects of skill failure (if you fail you make no progress) combined with the advice on when to roll (Don't roll if failure will bring the adventure to a stop or derail the plot.) If you follow those two bits of advice together you'll never roll for anything. The other concern is that the GMs advice on creating adventures appears to recommend railroading. As far how simple the rules are - after a single night with the rule book I feel I'd be happy to run the game. By comparison after two weeks studying Burning Wheel I think I'm just getting the hang of things.<br/><br/>The high point of the game is plot points. Plot points are awarded for roleplaying, bringing complications into play and achieving game objectives. They can be used to improve skill rolls, save the character from death, or for a limited form of player authorship. It also ties loosely into the character development by granting extra XP for spending a plot point within a session. Unfortunately the authors show the their view of the relative importance by granting up to 6 plot points for meeting objectives set in the adventure, and only 2 points for bringing complications into play, and just a single point for stunning roleplaying. With regards to spending them use to improve skill rolls is cheap whilst anything beyond the most basic plot tweak is prohibitively expensive). Further more the way it ties into the XP system looks like it will reward players for frequent small plot point usage.<br/><br/>Character advancement allows players to increase skills and attributes, however it also allows them to buy new assets, and buy off unwanted complications (with GM approval). The trend here will be towards characters with less and less complications (although perhaps in play the small plot point reward for bringing complications into play may discourage players from doing this)  <br/><br/>Overall I feel it\u2019s not a bad game, but its not one I plan to play. It is written with a view towards a cohesive group working together. There are rules specifically written in to avoid inter PC conflict and the reward system rewards group achievements over individual achievement of personal goals. Whilst this would be perfect for a group quest story its not very representative of the new Battlestar Galactica which is about difficult moral questions. In fact I actually feel this game would work much better for the old Battlestar Galactica (where the feel of the game is more in keeping with the series).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183005/#Comment_183005" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T04:16:25+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  4:16AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2008 4:21AM by Kobayashi.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: R00kie</cite>You could almost play Battlestar Galactica with Burning Empires without making any changes.

For the BSG of the Premier, Razor, and the first couple of episodes, I'd use the published BSG game. If I were masochistic enough to want to model the latter BSG storylines, I'd use something like Cold City.<br/><br/>Actually, I'd be willing to take the basic premise that the new Cylons offer, and use Cold City to explore it - but I'd make it an alternate take on the BSG universe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183103/#Comment_183103" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T14:16:07+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  2:16PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting distinction.

HWCtLH is the first RPG that I have played that did this well. HWCtLH handles this by having two GM's. The Inside GM deal with conficts inside the tribe.
