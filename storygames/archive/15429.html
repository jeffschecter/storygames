I'm currently looking at using Dungeon World.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow should I handle XP and advancement for these kids?  I kind of like Ryan Macklin's version <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2011/10/dw-xp-experiment/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, since it seemingly takes a step out of the process.  I've seen Advancement-by-party work pretty well too, though, and I want to encourage these two brothers to cooperate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other advice for me?  I'm open to any ideas, including questioning whether DW is the right game for this or not--it's just what I had on hand when the elder brother and I were talking about adventure games.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chrisshorb" title="chrisshorb"><img alt="chrisshorb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chrisshorb">chrisshorb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349997/#Comment_349997" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T21:15:18+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  9:15PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It worked great with my 10 year old.  My now 13 year old won't play, he hated D&amp;D - it was too structured, and too much math (yeah yeah, I know).<br>\n<br>\nBut we just sort of played free-form narrative, where he was a character from an anime series, and was doing crazy moves (Bankai!).<br>\n<br>\nI think DW is exactly right to introduce kids to RP gaming.

Certainly not the most nuanced approach but it informs play in a "you want XP?  better play the game this way!" sort of direction.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parker%20D%20Hicks" title="Parker D Hicks"><img alt="Parker D Hicks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parker%20D%20Hicks">Parker D Hicks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350854/#Comment_350854" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T18:48:51+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  6:48PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, everybody!  Played the first session tonight, and it was a hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nA played Cadeus, the Elven Fighter.  He has a huge , shining, blue sword with hooks and barbs.  He has blue hair, and wears all blue.<br/>\nJ played Lenore, the (male) Human Cleric of St. Gorog, Patron of Knowledge and Hidden Things.  Gorog's symbol is the palm-side of a closed fist.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started with Bloodstone Idol, and got just to the main entrance.  The Grimtooth and the Icescale were in the middle of a shouting match, so Lenore walked up and Magic Missiled the lead Icescale in the face (Human racial move).  A ray of fire shot from his open hand as he clutched his holy symbold, and the Icescale went down for the count.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, Cadeus tried to throw a dagger at a lizardman (failed), vault the rampart (failed), and take a lizardman hostage (failed twice, succeeded soft the third time...he was persistent), while Lenore tried to protect him.  Unfortunately, that stand off is how we had to end--Cadeus had just thrown away his sword in order to solidify his grip on an Icescale, and the Grimtooth were just starting to stab away lustily.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went with the BBC style of highlighting, but I don't think J quite understood.  A ended up with 5 XP because he had Attack and Stunt highlighted, whereas J had Discover and Defend highlighted, and only got one.  They really wanted to charge in, swords flashing and missiles flying.  I asked several times "Do you want to take a look around, see if you can learn something?"  They both went "Psh!  Why?" and charged forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'll highlight Attack for both of them, and then give one Parley and the other Discover next time (or maybe Aid?).  Because of the XP imbalance, and because of the age difference, I think I'll move to XP-as-party in the future as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts on how I can encourage Discovery better?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350859/#Comment_350859" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T19:54:03+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  7:54PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If they ever use it and get helpful information from it, that might encourage it, but that doesn't help them use it in the first place.<br><br>You could have them find a situation where there's no apparent way forward, but they can find one with discover.
