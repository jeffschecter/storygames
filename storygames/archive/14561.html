Because I love "Rescue Me" and think that kind of show deserves some good genre emulation, and, well, genre emulation is kind of what I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm hoping for a few things, some gribbly gear and detail oriented action play, and some way of emulating the strain a job like that puts on the people that do it. Some sort of morale system would be nice too, but the one I've used in Combat Diaries isn't a good fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm starting to lean heavily towards a granular sort of action turn followed by a more mechanically abstract personal turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if this is written in only-Ogre-understands-this.

It's certainly a game where the initial setup of any given 'mission' begs to be a series of nested lists like in 3:16.<br><br>I'm really looking forward to seeing how you tackle the genre trope where self-medication, mostly alcohol, keeps characters functioning past their physical and emotional limits right up until the tipping point where it's suddenly and obviously hurting more than it helps.

I'd try and fiddle and complicate it a bit. Instead of a single pile of threat tokens you have two piles (numbers to be determined). <br/><br/><strong>One is the "Victims" pile.</strong> Your Rescue Team must do stuff (maneuvers, rolls, whatever) to reduce this pile. Each token is a person with a name, a life, a job, friends, maybe a cat. These details should be part of the process somehow. Maybe you discover them from turn to turn, fleshing out the victims, and/or you know them when they die and/or get terribly wounded. When the Rescuers reduce the pile, those victims are in the ambulances and running to the ER. We'll discover at the end of the game if they live. This pile can be brought to zero. No victims, mission ALMOST ended. The Team still has to come out alive from the burning building/sinking ship/crashed train cars/etc.<br/><br/><strong>The other is the "Danger" pile.</strong> The Rescue Team can choose to do stuff (maneuvers, rolls, etc.) to fight and reduce *this* pile instead. This lowers the threat level of the situation. Bringing this pile to zero should be very hard: no threat, end of mission, remaining Victim tokens go to ER. Each turn the Danger makes "attacks"/"maneuvers" to either: <strong>Endanger the Rescue Team</strong> (a floor collapses, fire flashes from an opened door, a gas tank explodes) making attacks to the characters directly. <strong>Endanger the Victims</strong>: a roll (probably harder than the one against the team) to attack the Victim token pile. People get injured, then badly injured and/or die. And finally, the Danger can roll (do stuff) to <strong>Increase the Danger</strong>. Yep, more danger tokens. Shit just got worse.<br/><br/>Other fun stuff: \n<ul>\n<li>Roles for the members of the Rescue Team, obviously, giving them edges and rules-bending tools (the Field EMT / Combat Medic can stabilize injured people, maybe roll to try and keep them alive, and so on)</li>\n<li>Rooms/zones. Either on a single map, or as different stages in the mission.</li>\n<li>...dunno, other stuff</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331744/#Comment_331744" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T16:36:36+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  4:36PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You ever see the TV Show "Emergency"?

I wish he or you would. I don't think we have a game yet that would do them justice! Though <a href="http://ipressgames.com/serial.html" rel="nofollow">Serial Homicide Unit</a> is a great cop game on they detective and sleuthing side of things. It seems like this is a different part of the job you'd be portraying. \n<blockquote>What Renatoram wrote.</blockquote>\nAwesome stuff! Also, give the emergency worker a life, loves, fun and responsibilities. Then, as things go wrong right the Victims may tie in or parallel their life, or the stress of complications on the job put pressure on the home life. Somewhat like spy vs. guy stuff in spy fiction (see <a href="http://spione.adept-press.com/" rel="nofollow">Spione</a>).<br/><br/>Another element that could be included is mystery. Police, EMT and firefighters are presented with a situation gone wrong as they begin interacting with people. Most often. Then they have a mystery on their hands: what is wrong with the patient? How can we stop the blaze/what started it? Who committed this crime or how can we stop this situation. <br/><br/>And an element of these lives is the difference in scale of the things they deal with. You might have EMTs respond to someone with a panic attack as well as the domestic violence or terrible car crash. Though, depending on what you are looking for you might just want to frame to the hardest hitting cases.

It's about struggling with incompetent management who are solely interested in their own careers, fighting to get the equipment you need to actually do your job, and of dealing with dross for 99% of your shift. The 1% can be 'interesting' but usually fairly standard in what you have to do in order to stabilise, package and convey your patient (or cover quietly with a blanket and hand over to the police).<br/><br/>I think you're looking for an idealised view of the role, which is cool and a damn sight more interesting than the real thing. Yes there are horrible jobs that make you go "eew" but they are few and far between for the most part (and that's a good thing). <br/><br/>There's a huge built-in pressure valve that most of those in the emergency services have. Gallow's humour. It can be quite disturbing (for those not in the job) sitting in the messroom after a one-under (person under a train) or some other job where bits have to be collected. The jokes that fly about are fairly grim, but wholly necessary to let of steam. <br/><br/>It's also (from my perspective in the LAS) a very team-based job with all sorts of services, managers and passers-by turning up to offer help or just get in the way when the 'big one' come in. I did a road traffic accident this weekend where an old boy had had a fit while driving, took out two other cars and then a shop. I counted over 40 emergency services personnel there: fire brigade, police, a doctor, an LAS management team and first responders, police scene management and traffic police. The driver had to be cut out, and in all we were on scene for an hour getting him free. It was all very calm, professional and ordered. From the outside I'm sure it looked very exciting. It wasn't.<br/><br/>If there is anything I can do to help, however, please feel free to email me (johndavidanderson at hotmail dot com) and I'll certainly give you some more insights into how London's ambulance works and how it interacts with other emergency services and the sort of things we actually do, rather than what is portrayed on the the telebox.<br/><br/>John                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TekknoTroll" title="TekknoTroll"><img alt="TekknoTroll" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.shrani.si/f/1n/aq/3V5SU0Iw/ehehe32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TekknoTroll">TekknoTroll</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332043/#Comment_332043" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T07:14:15+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  7:14AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, Teataine's favourite troll here who also moonlights as a firefighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, let me say that I'd love to see a game about rescue services around, but I must also agree with John, what you see on them colourful screens is far from the general truth about rescue services. I do not have any first hand experience with police or medical rescue services, so I'll try and help with only the part I'm familiar with.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, as a firefighter, unless you're member of one of the few units that cover the most busy areas in the world, you'll be spending a lot of time doing...well nothing. All right, that is not exactly accurate, but there is a lot of down time. Which I think could/should be implemented in to the system, for it would add an additional depth to it. Do you spend the downtime just relaxing? Working on your personal issues? Team issues? Refreshing your skills? The skills part is a pretty important one and could be used in conjunction with whatever skill system you will go for. Because when you train to become a firefighter they teach you an insane myriad of skills, from how to pull a guy out of a car wreck, how to tackle a bazillion different types of fires, rope and climbing techniques, advanced first aid (somewhere between common people and proper paramedics), psychology, chemical warfare (just kidding, but you do learn a lot about chemicals and accidents related with them), scuba diving, etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly after you are assigned to your unit you might start specializing, depending on the needs, size and the budget of the unit. If there's no specialization plan in the unit you're assigned to, you're basically a jack of all trades. And unless you spend a considerable time refreshing those skills they'll start degrading pretty quickly. So this could be one of the possibilities for downtime that would heavily impact your character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm somewhat in a hurry here, so I just tossed out a few things for now. If you have any specific questions regarding firefighters in any aspect, I'll be glad to help, so just toss 'em down here and I'll do my best to satisfy your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332059/#Comment_332059" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T10:03:51+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 10:03AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game could be great in a one-shot format, taking comments from John and Peter into account: most of the job has been down time, and suddenly The Big Day hits.<br/><br/>I think that most games play up the more interesting/fantastic aspects of the job and ignore the mundane ones. Even D&amp;D fighters spend more time practicing, traveling, and sharpening their swords than they do in an actual fight.<br/><br/>Fatigue could be a good resource for the characters, because that can come both from physical struggles and from dealing with relationships.

It's also mission based, with an order from on high to "Go to X" and "Resolve problem Y". I agree with Colin that it will focus on the moments that stand out rather than the dross of the average shift. <br/><br/>In terms of the character interplay, yeah I can relate to that. If you have a regular crewmate (which I did for 2 years of 12-hour shifts) you end up spending more time with your crewmate than partner. That can lead to interesting relationships.<br/><br/>For fatigue (certainly an issue, with burn-out being common) and a second wind I just have a vision of the "Damn it! Don't you die!

Just like war movies tend not to dwell on the long periods of travel and standing around wondering what's going on, rescue emergency shows don't dwell on the downtime as much either. According to my firefighter friends most of the job is eat, sleep, watch tv, work out, watch tv, eat, maintenance, ad nauseum...oh, hey, a call!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of this is to emulate shows like Emergency, Rescue Me, Third Watch, etc. It's drama not documentary, though thanks for the reminder about red tape and funding, as well as middle and upper management bullshit, those are great stressors to add alongside spouses, personality conflicts, diversity issues and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly I want someone to have a scene where they say "My guy is taking too many pills for his back and washing them down with vodka, and it's starting to show, who wants to do a scene where someone brings it up?" and then the outcome of that scene impacts the team's response to whatever it is they're doing. Maybe he get's light headed in a burning building and someone has to yank him out, maybe he has a meltdown at a grieving family member as they're removing the body of a shut-in from a tiny junk filled room, and maybe he gets his shit together and does the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood drama has a pace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332122/#Comment_332122" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T14:51:04+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  2:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More to the point, you could make a hell of an entertaining show or game about my eight years as a bouncer in a goth fetish club.

That could be a lot of fun and a little nerve-wraking. <br>If you're rolling dice for some type of resolution and you get "a call" on...<br>Firefighters: 1 on a D20<br/>EMT: 1 on a d10<br/>Police: 1 on a d6<br/><br/>Oh man, I'd put in the mother of all random encounter tables for this game. I'd also call the GM dispatch.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332237/#Comment_332237" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T08:55:42+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  8:55AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>"fat bald asshole reads a book."</blockquote>\nI'd play that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332238/#Comment_332238" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T08:57:20+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  8:57AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>"fat bald asshole reads a book."</blockquote>\nI'd play that.<br/><br/>So would I, if it was rules-heavy enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332328/#Comment_332328" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T16:21:03+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  4:21PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2011 4:21PM by Ogremarco.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>"fat bald asshole reads a book."</blockquote>\nI'd play that.<br/><br/>So would I, if it was rules-heavy enough.<br/>I played that for eight years.

You have a team of characters focused on an objective (the mission, or in this case perhaps "rescue people from a burning building"). Each character takes a turn in the spotlight for both a personal and a mission scene in each act, with the mission scenes adding up to an overall success or failure for the group. Personal scenes work in conflict to the mission scenes, meaning that generally you have to fail in one to have success in the other. It seems like a good fit unless you want to be pretty detailed in the resolution of the action ("I kick in the door!" "Okay, roll vs. Bad-Ass").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
