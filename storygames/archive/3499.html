It's a CCG (okay, maybe not collectible, but boxed set).<br/><br/>It's a cyberpunk game where adolescent biker gang boys struggle their way through a confusing mess of ego-inflated gang contests, violent gay relationships with other gang members, and a scramble for identity.<br/><br/>If you want to know the world info, read this first boxed text. If you don't, then just skip it because the above paragraph caps it really briefly.\n<blockquote>In the really-fuckin'-close-maybe-already future, corporations and housing projects and urban centres are growing way too quickly. More and more, things start falling through the cracks. When you have multiple management re-arrangements and neighbourhood re-zonings and such, it's not all that unlikely that some of what you are developing/managing accidentally gets lost in the paperwork. Here's what that looks like in the future in practical terms: because of rapid expansion, companies and centres are unable to keep tabs on everything they own, and often stuff gets totally forgotten, misplaced, or accidentally put under the management of a sector that no longer exists. Companies create "pockets" of lost product.<br/><br/>"Pockets" can refer to shipments of motorcycles, homes within a housing complex, or employees who got bumped into a non-existant sector.<br/><br/>Now, in the future ID and money mean basically the same thing. Your bank card and your passport are the same device, and it's embedded into your arm. Which means if you're, say... an illegal alien, you don't have money or any way to get it. If you're a wanted criminal, they just <i>shut down your ID</i> and suddenly you can't afford to stay on the run much longer.<br/><br/>Some people don't have ID embedded into their arms, for any of a number of reasons: they are illegal aliens, they had it removed because they are criminals, they were born to parents who had no embedded ID, or maybe their bodies developed Cyber Shock Syndrome (which occurs when you have too many augmentations or cybernetics and your body rejects them/some of them) and reject their ID and in the hysteria that comes with Cyber Shock Syndrome they destroy it or discard it.<br/><br/>Now, let's combine the two phenomenon (pockets and living without embedded ID): You have people who legally and financially don't exist, and you have a bunch of lost product all over the place. These people become pockets themselves. They live off of the pocket product which also conveniently doesn't exist.<br/><br/>People have a phrase in the future. "Expect a 5% pocket". Companies factor into their budgets the assumption that 5% of the work they do will become pocket (ie, that they'll have such shitty mismanagement that they'll manage to lose 5% of everything they create). When they see a street person, they whisper "5% pocket" to themselves, because it's common knowledge that a lot of people don't have ID and you should just get used to the fact that these people you see don't *really* exist, right?<br/><br/>Some of these pockets are really isolated from other pockets and the rest of the world. People intentionally ignore pockets. They expect a five percent pocket, and so they expect five percent of the world they encounter to not really exist because it's not documented anywhere. So you get this phenomenon where sometimes there are orphan biker boys with really expensive (nonexistant/pocket) stuff, having gang fights at the subway station... but you just try to get out of their way and ignore them because they don't exist and they can never exist.</blockquote>\nSo, this is how the card game works maybe:<br/><br/>Each player has a gang. Gangs consist of between 2-7 gang members at a given time, I think.<br/><br/>You score points by winning contests. Here are some examples:<br/>-Street Race Along Yentin Avenue<br/>-Challenge: Cross the Pipes Without Slipping<br/>-Barenuckle Rumble<br/>-Subway Shootout<br/><br/>And the idea is that people play these contests and then rush to gather the resources to get the "win conditions" first. <br/><br/>Now, there are a bunch of types of cards (It's a CCG!). There are gangers and contest cards obviously. There are also relationships. If you play the relationship Weak-Knees and Shaky Fingers on Samson (yours) and Ponyboy (mine), which states that, say, both can't compete in a contest against each other... it's a hinderance to me. Most of the relationship cards are about sex or love or confused, misplaced hate... and most relationships work as hinderances and barriers in mechanical terms (making two enemy gangers fall in love means they are less likely to try and kill each other in the heat of battle, maybe). Another type of card is Gear, and that comes in both cybernetic flavour and non-cybernetic flavour. Gear makes you more effective.<br/><br/>And now, the next logical step in my mind is to figure out what "stats" gangers have, and that'll inform how I structure win conditions and the rest of the mechanics of the game.<br/><br/>Here are some thoughts I have, and I want to get a gauge on their cool factor as well as other suggestions for what I could do:<br/><br/>-Three stats: Physical, Mental, Social. Contests could be framed like "To win, stack 7 Physical and 2 Social on a single turn."<br/><br/>-Two stats: Courage, Ability. Contests could be framed like "To win, stack 6 Courage and 2 Ability on a single turn."<br/><br/>-Stats like: Bravery 2d4, Fears Anonymity 2d6, Strong Bones 1d8. When one applies to a contest, you roll the dice. Contests could be framed like, "Any stats that bolster bravery, competition, running, jumping, mobility and balance apply", and you need to score a total of 20 points amonst all your accumulated die rolls to win a contest.<br/><br/>-Stats like: Brave, Strong, Fast, Cunning. Contests could be framed like, "To win, stack Brave and Cunning and Manipulative and Cool". No numbers, just keywords.<br/><br/>so... yeah... based on the information I've given you, do any of these jump out as good? Can you explain some other ways for structuring stats/contests?<br/><br/>The rest of the game probably works like: draw X cards, play cards during a certain phase, play contests during a certain phase, stack cards onto conflicts during a certain phase. I'm not planning on anything innovative in these departments, so far.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78972/#Comment_78972" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-01T03:57:59+00:00" title="July  1, 2007  3:57AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, I like this. <br/><br/>Given that you've got such an evocative setting, I wouldn't use generic stats like Physical, Mental and Social. Brave, Strong, Fast and Cunning aren't bad, but you could use ones more applicable to the setting: Grit, Toughness, Street Smarts. Stuff like that.<br/><br/>I really wouldn't use dice. You've got cards: use those.<br/><br/>Given that you're using CCG cards, I'd use that style of resolution system. Perhaps each Gang Member card has stats on Grit, Toughness and Cunning and, in contests, the highest number wins. Perhaps Relationship cards give bonuses to those. <br/><br/>Then cards could have special powers..."Ambush: You may use three gang members in a challenge against your opponent's one". That sort of thing. "You may remove one of your opponent's cards from play". "Defection: Take one of your opponents Gang Members."<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79042/#Comment_79042" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T01:55:43+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  1:55AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh fuck! i am SOOOOOOO glad you are thinking more about this, i was thinking about my parallel rpg all the way down from olympia today (in portland now, surprise!) watching bikers go past. and i'll blather about that later.<br/><br/>bonuses in lieu of dice. maybe cards from your hand could be discarded into a discard pile if you use their actual purpose (get samson and ponyboy into a relationship) or can be discarded into your DECK if you use them as a numerical modifier; and maybe at the beginning of each of your turns you draw up to a hand total of five cards (or whatever) OR if you already have five or more, you draw ONE and there's no max hand size. let's say.<br/><br/>that being said, i agree with graham about the no dice, but i like where you were going with the stack X total points from between skills A, B, C, D, and/or E.<br/>and i could play a card on two of your gangers that give them a negative relationship, and for your next challenge (OR whenever i spend a card on it, or a "relationship fueling card" which would then be discarded into my deck, i can use the ability of the relationship card i placed between samson and treddie)...<br/>okay, my sentance structure is wack but let's say the card means that treddie won't help samson if i "fuel" the relationship. if i (your opponent) discard a viable card back into my deck, treddie's skill C won't add to the total that you need to complete the challenge, because the primary challenger is samson.<br/><br/>that was very poorly explained, i think.<br/><br/>and what am i doing, designing your game for you? sorry if this was too much. i just really like this project. CSX-1 ARM CANNON GO!!!!<br/><br/>to recap, i like the keywords thing, mixed with numbers too. that way i could just pour on the SKILL A, or i could pick up SKILL A, B and C cards and still beat it out.<br/><br/>if it's not a CCG, but just a CG, (and all the cards come together, so there's no physical ownership issues, though there still could be deck building and expansion packs), then the challenges could be in a seperate deck, which are drawn randomly every turn. or SOME of the cahllenges are in that third deck, and some are also in the decks that the players raw from every turn.<br/><br/>um, what's the win conditions? kill off / subjugate / disband  the rival gang? reduce your opponent from 20 life to zero? gotta catch em all?<br/>maybe you could have characters who are in love with rival gang membrs (or who are hit with a number of diffrent love cards, all adding up) count as "defeated" by the gang with whom the smitten character is infatuated with a member of?<br/><br/>...and i want bike races that might have my pubescent love-sick directionless sob story crash in a burning wreck in a pedestrian open-air mall, with television coverage talking about how another three hundred units of pocket were filled today in the north eastern quadrent. i want to see the tears of the boy he left behind, though the dead boy didn't know the name of the one that survived him.<br/><br/>can you give me that in a card game, or should i be ordering Bliss Stage?<br/><br/>seriously, though, bike races that have 1) did you beat your opponent 2) did you die in the race<br/>would be really fucking amazing.<br/><br/>and am i gonna be able to play cards that make my opponent's gang members' bodies reject their implants? because, if so, "sweet!"<br/><br/>love, jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79420/#Comment_79420" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T19:18:00+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  7:18PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 7:19PM by jackson_tegu.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            brave, strong, fast, cunning- all of this is good. general descriptioins are great but they maybe should be kind of exclusive to- and i was thinking you could have like 10 total descriptions, and then Samson could have Brave 5, Fast 4 and ponyboy could have Fast 3, Cunning 2, Reflexes 2, Charm 1, Aim 1, Bluff 1.<br/><br/>what do homeless orphans need to do?<br/>shoot their arm cannons. ride their motor cycles. charm their way out of trouble and into it.

A Seduction 4 Leadership 2 Scavenging 2 character might be really useful as a resource generator but not a contest winner (ie, the boy in the shadows).<br/><br/>Possible win conditions:<br/>1.) Win 5 contests.<br/>2.) Have won 4 more contests than your opponent(s).<br/>3.) Win 5 contests, but subtract from that <i>your total </i>the number of relationships your gangers have with enemy gangers.<br/>4.) Have won 5 contests, but subtract from <i>the target number</i> the number of relationships your gangers have with enemy gangers.<br/>5.) Give contests a certain "score", and you have to accumulate 15 Contest Points to win (with contests ranging from 1-5 points each).<br/><br/>Here are some example contests for this system, maybe:<br/><br/>Sacramento Drive<br/>(image/flavour text of a bike race in the sunset, on a dangerous corner)<br/>Win Condition: Bravery 3, Reflexes 5.<br/>Special Rules: Solo win.<br/>Can invoke: bike items, weapon items, Stim items.<br/><br/>The Smith Station Pipes<br/>(image/flavour text of a series of slimy pipes above an open sewage channel or deep chasm, and a bunch of boys egging one on to cross it)<br/>Win condition: Bravery 5, Speed 1, Reflexes 2.<br/>Special Rules: Solo win.<br/>Can invoke: Stim items.<br/><br/>Midnight Brawl<br/>(image of a good old fashioned bloody fistfight)<br/>Win condition: Speed 1, Aggression 5.<br/>Special Rules: link (violence).<br/>Can invoke: weapon items, stim items.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
