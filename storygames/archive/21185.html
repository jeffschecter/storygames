When I heard that story about the cybernetic eye, I was like OK yes. I want this.</p>\n<p>Chronicle is\u2026 its so short, and so small of a change from Microscope, it could be summarized in a blog post! It\u2019s so weird that that\u2019s a selling point of the book. I am really glad I got the book because the advice in the advice part I used a <em>lot</em> of. I\u2019m glad I read it before my first game.</p>\n<p>Union\u2026 was another thing I wanted. And it\u2019s different enough, but\u2026 we\u2019d need to hack it right away, or make a similar expansion based on it. Because the one family I really wanted to use it for (Tarala and Yufar, half-siblings in our D&amp;D game), already they have different fathers and that\u2019s already a problem with Union. The hacks needed aren\u2019t mind-melting esp for an old LISP-head like me (just make a custom card with \u201cthree parents\u201d and from there do it as per vanilla Union) but the campaign is already so poly and so queer. I went from \u201cWhen will the books explore so we can start doing Union and Chronicle\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll ever even do Union\u201d.</p>\n<p>So that leaves\u2026 some amazing advice <em>especially for those who have never played Microscope</em>, a very very small &amp; simple hack on Microscope [obv playtesting is what you pay for; but cost \u2260 value \u2260 price etc etc], some good but kinda obvious (???) seeds, some even smaller hacks that also look very useful but also pretty obvious <small>(like using place instead of time \u2014 but that\u2019s the reader\u2019s hindsight. I guess all elegant works give a \u201cwell, duh\u201d impression <em>after</em> you read them. I remember having the same reaction to \u201cdiagram dungeons\u201d in Red Tide \u2014 the name sounded so interesting, the idea was more \u201coh, was that it\u201d-ish than I thought\u2026 but, in practice, I\u2019ve used them a <em>lot</em> after I read it, and never before I read it, so apparently the idea wasn\u2019t as obvious as I thought \u2014 and I suspect the same is the case with the ideas in Explorer)</small>, and Union, a very mononormative version of Microscope that well it\u2019s just not what we were looking for (we have players who are poly-married with kids etc).</p>\n<p>And, Echo, which is the one part that I haven\u2019t even read at all! I\u2019ll read it later, maybe it\u2019s amazing!</p>\n<p>(I wanted Microscope and Chronicle primarily for the purpose of enriching the backstory of our existing setting. Which we found out today works very very well and is fun. The book has good advice for this. But that\u2019s also why I haven\u2019t read Echo, we\u2019re not doing time travel, we\u2019re doing Zakhara &amp; Forgotten Realms.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464165/#Comment_464165" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-18T23:04:23+00:00" title="June 18, 2017 11:04PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Rules supplements" for rules-light collaborative games can be a pretty funny thing sometimes!
