It would seem like any setup with fewer than four children would penalize suitors of a given disposition, which might make the game unfun. And in \u201cMuch Ado About the Shrew\u201d that problem would be heightened: one player of a matching temperament would have a large advantage if there is a single available bride-to-be. (You might also consider giving Signor Torregrossa a temperament of his own, and possibly a mother figure or other parental type, thereby limiting down the required number of children and making some decisions more complex.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA bigger concern for me though is that I don\u2019t see any place where the fiction and the mechanics interface strongly. The game has a potential to become \u201cparlor narration\u201d, whereby you describe what happens, but your desription doesn\u2019t really have any impact on what happens: just the die roll matters. This has a potential to end up like playing Monopoly while talking in a funny voice. Eventually, the game\u2019s rules overtake the playacting, and the funny voices are dropped. And for a game of winning love and respect, you\u2019d expect the petitioned bride to be or parent to make more judgment calls based on what the suitor did. This can be fixed, though, by having the patriarch give bonuses for describing particularly romantic scenes or convincing promises. The current forswearing rules cover some of this territory but are again very mechanical with little reference to the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith some work, though, this could become a solid game.<br/>\n<br/>\nREPLY<br/>\njaradfennell<br/>\nJul 31, 2011 @ 18:25:20<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the comments, Nick! Okay, on to your concerns:<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that players could modify the number of intended brides as they see fit. What I might add is the caveat that the humorous natures should only be repeated in games with 4+ intended. Also, it was my intent that every character, including Signore Torregrossa, have a nature. The idea of introducing other parental figures is interesting. I\u2019ll have to think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will also have to consider the interface between the fiction and the mechanics. Perhaps giving Signore Torregrossa some license to reward or penalize players for good/bad role-playing is warranted. As written, I was worried that the mechanics determined too much of the fiction, so I think it\u2019s a valid point and there should at least be an optional rule which allows the players to influence the die rolls more.<br/>\n<br/>\ndconstructions<br/>\nJul 27, 2011 @ 04:06:48<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this game a lot. It\u2019s well structured both in scenes and acts and combines a fun gaming luck elements with good story results. Luck plays a factor but if games are kept short this shouldn\u2019t matter (and losing can be part of the fun when it makes a story).<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally disagree with Nick, I think story and mechanics are very well knit together, since you took the time to specify what kind of things equate to what kinds of die rolls. Plus all of it is nicely summarised at the end. If you could react to story too much, the Patriarch could just be a jerk or it would end up being a game of \u201cwho can improvise better\u201d.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only problem is I don\u2019t think the humours system is interesting enough to give the characters distinction. It\u2019s not quite enough to just invent names and backgrounds, we could use some examples or guidelines or even random tables. I like that the humours make your personality affect the game but it might be a bit unfair for whoever lucked out by choosing the wrong one for the Patriarch, and thus loses a dice every turn he tries to gain Esteem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmall niggles, easily fixed I suspect. I think I\u2019ll give this one a try soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nREPLY<br/>\njaradfennell<br/>\nJul 31, 2011 @ 18:30:17<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate the comments, D. You are absolutely right. I should have added more examples and advice for playing out the humours, but\u2026 I was already over the word count limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do give it a try, please let me know how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick Phelan<br/>\nJul 30, 2011 @ 10:46:47<br/>\n<br/>\nTo start with I\u2019m going to apologise for having put this off so long! There\u2019s no excuse. The reason is my particular head-in-sand freaking out about responsibilities. Waffling over, let\u2019s move on to the game!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo start off with a very simple introduction, I really liked this game. The atmosphere built up readily, likely because of the well-chosen and thriftily out-of-copyright images. I could see the Italian villa, the heady sun, the bare vines waiting for fruit, and those two actors from that one how-to-Shakespeare production I saw in high school, though that might just be me. That made the rest of the game seem comfortable and expected, even the bits about suicide and cuckolding. Speaking of which, from a tactical standpoint, I loved the fact that the players couldn\u2019t simply pour on points and hope to succeed. Trying to impress a girl and her father at once should feel like walking a tightrope.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the game\u2019s pretty complete as it is, and that it is what it is, boxed and defined quite perfectly. I do wonder about the humours \u2013 while they make a wonderful period moment and helpfully tie in an ingredient, it seems like a poor choice could ruin a player\u2019s chances through no fault of his own, particularly in Much Ado About The Shrew. Perhaps, spitballing aloud, have a Prologue before the Acts where the suitors can judge the girls\u2019 Natures, and then make their actions to each girl based around a Nature?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs well, it\u2019s not clear how or if one can \u2018switch targets\u2019, and that leads to the possible situation where a suitor targets all his wooing towards one intended, ignoring the Patriarch altogether, and then switches to another on Act V, proudly proclaiming that since both his Esteem and Affection are 0, they are perfectly matched and thus grant wedded bliss. And then all the other players would throw dice at him, but it might be nice to nip it in the bud, rather than rely on dice-based judgement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut these are minor matters. The game is very complete on its own and looks like an entirely fun way to spend an afternoon; I hope to find suitable players to run a round before long. Again, I love the atmosphere, the mechanics, and the opportunity for langourous backbiting gossip. Full bars.<br/>\n<br/>\nREPLY<br/>\njaradfennell<br/>\nJul 31, 2011 @ 18:46:06<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me Patrick, it\u2019s okay! My own week was pretty hectic, and for some reason I thought the deadline was July 31st rather than July 30. I only finished my own reviews this morning. That said, thank you for the feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou make a salient point about an ill-chosen humour ruining a suitor\u2019s chances and the importance of judging an intended\u2019s nature before paying suit. I imagined this as taking place in the first Act or two, which is where a lot of the player interaction would take place as suitors figured out between them who was best suited for each bride. I can imagine a situation out of Taming of the Shrew, in which Hortensio convinces Petruchio to woo Katherina (who are alike in nature) so that he can pursue her younger sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy intention was that the Patriarch character would never reveal the number of dice he is rolling (perhaps rolling them behind a screen), so the suitors never have any mechanical indication that they are suited or unsuited for a particular bride. They have to guess her nature based on the Patriarch player\u2019s role-playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, there should be plenty of discussion between the suitors and the Patriarch about who should be hooking up with whom. That\u2019s the meat of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I expected there might be competition between suitors and some switching of targets. You make a valid point about the propensity some players might have of switching intended at the end in order to \u201cwin\u201d wedded bliss. To fix it, I would add the rule that a bride\u2019s Affection (even a zero) only counts once the player has attempted at least one Demonstration roll with her. Perhaps I\u2019ll make the threshold for wedded bliss a little narrower as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JaradFennell" title="JaradFennell"><img alt="JaradFennell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JaradFennell">JaradFennell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337304/#Comment_337304" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T12:42:45+00:00" title="August  5, 2011 12:42PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mathalus<br/>\nJul 31, 2011 @ 07:12:45<br/>\n<br/>\nStar-Crossed Lovers<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be completely honest. While I was first skimming through this game, my eyes started to glaze over a bit. The text seemed tiny and long, though the pictures were nice. A day later I printed it out and was flipping back and forth, trying hard to give your game the attention I thought it deserved. (I think you can move most of your first two pages to the back as advice. The game starts near the end of page 2, with The Suitors &amp; Their Exile).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I\u2019m skimming the text and trying to get excited about the Greek Humors, when\u2026 I saw it. The last entry in the first table, \u201cDouble suicide.\u201d (Shakespeare Fist PUMP).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is awesome. Needless to say, I started reading the game more thoroughly.<br/>\nMy base nature is that of a powergamer and now I had a challenge. How could increase my chances of such an awesome ending? I was excited to find out that I get to pick my Standing and Passion. (Passion 3, here I come double suicide!). So now I was all set: I can max my rolls by starting low and building up. I\u2019m not required to attempt a Promise, so I won\u2019t run the risk of gaining any Esteem. It\u2019s unlikely that anyone who is taking a balanced approach will be able to overtake my lead for combined Esteem and Affection, so I get to pick my suicide buddy. I guess I only have one question left:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are the other players here? I get the Patriarch\u2019s purpose, but the other players can\u2019t help or hinder me. We all frame our own scenes. I guess they could be in a scene with me, but it will already be me and the Patriarch playing his child. If we have five people playing Star Crossed lovers, 4 of them won\u2019t get to have any narrative control or influence over 75% of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nReducing the children to just one would solve this problem (Much Ado about the Shrew), but it would create another: now the game is a straight competition, but it lacks the strategic breadth or depth to make the competition interesting. And, as the reviewers above point out, there are no rewards for excellent story-telling and no benefit to narration, so it can\u2019t even be a \u201cwho can improvise better\u201d contest (which I would have no intrinsic problem enjoying).<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022\tWhat advice would you offer to the Patriarch for choosing the natures of his children? Should he make sure he covers the spread, or try to match it to the suitors?<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022\tThe Patriarch narrates failure, who narrates success? (Please say the suitor!)<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022\tThere seems to be little mechanical difference between Passion and Standing. Instead of having them be perfect mechanical synonyms, could they work differently with nature?<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the suitor sheet, it is well organized and helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nREPLY<br/>\njaradfennell<br/>\nJul 31, 2011 @ 19:10:55<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the comments, Mathalus! I understand what you mean about the text being a chore to finish. I handed a copy to my wife, and her comment was, \u201cUh\u2026 Yeah, it looks okay. It reads like a textbook.\u201d I recognize that the text was often redundant, and this was deliberate, since I was trying to be clear about the rules. If I get around to revising the game, the first thing I want to punch up the prose a bit and give it a bit more panache.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it\u2019s cool that you decided to aim for an extreme outcome rather than a balanced one. While a balanced outcome is fine for supporting characters, the really interesting tragic and comedic characters in Shakespeare tend toward the extremes of the spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the other players, I saw the suitors getting together to discuss Signore Torregrossa\u2019s daughters and trying to nudge each other in the direction of one bride or another. If I were to play this game, I would love to see a scene out of Much Ado about Nothing in which the other players trick a character like Benedick into making a demonstration of love to an intended like Beatrice. Or a character like Don John convincing Claudio that Hero was being unfaithful. You are absolutely correct that this kind of player-character meddling should be reflected in the mechanics. Perhaps they could offer a Standing or Passion die as an Esteem or Affection die to help another player cover the stakes of a roll? If the rolling player wins the roll, he gains one Esteem or Affection, will the assisting player gains the other. Or a rival suitor can add to the Patriarch or intended\u2019s roll, gaining a single Esteem or Affection from screwing over their fellow suitor.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer your bullet points:<br/>\nI was considering adding a rule that instructs the Patriarch player to assign intended natures to cover the spread. I liked the idea that the person playing Torregrossa could play him as friendly and welcoming to the suitors or hot-headed and suspicious of them, fair or unfair, but I guess something should be done to ensure that the setup itself isn\u2019t unfair.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the suitor narrates the outcome of successful rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ll have to think about how to make Passion and Standing more mechanically distinct. Perhaps Passion works better in some way with \u201chot\u201d natures (sanguine and choleric) while Standing works better with \u201ccold\u201d ones (phlegmatic and melancholic).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\n<br/>\nMathalus<br/>\nAug 02, 2011 @ 23:38:34<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you compete over the same child? That seems like good fodder for a story, but in this game if you don\u2019t get your first pick, you get your second. Is there a way to represent two individuals throwing away time and resources chasing the same girl so they end up worse off in relation to the others?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Patriarch doesn\u2019t have to be fair in a Story Game. Now that the game can have an unlimited word length, you could just give advice on how to be mean and how to be nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could make the Passion dice \u201cexploding\u201d d6\u2019s, or the Standing dice could be d4+1 to show how reliable they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this game is cool.
