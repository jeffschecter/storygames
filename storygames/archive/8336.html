Not super heroes, you dig, but their precursors, the guys who have more in common with Dick Tracy than with the JLA.  Such as the Sandman (the one with the pinstripe suit &amp; gasmask, not the one with the gold and purple costume, or the Marvel villain), Dr. Occult, the Spirit, the Bat-Man, and later guys in the same spirit like the Question, Mr. A, and Rorschach.  The Shadow also fits right in.  As does Darkman.<br/><br/>Part of the difference is the level of power.  Mystery men aren't superhuman, merely extraordinary.  They don't have super powers; just gifts, gadgets, and gimmicks.  And while their gifts may include things beyond the normal human frame of reference (see Dr. Occult and the Shadow), it's never to the point that we would think of them as superhuman per se.<br/><br/>But the important difference is their opposition.  Super heroes fight super villains; mystery men fight ordinary crooks.  Mobsters, dirty cops, crooked politicians, femmes fatales.  These guys don't have super powers either; they just have game, guns, and guile.<br/><br/>Game is where I'm running into problems.  These guys have schemes, plans, and aces up their sleeves.  Ambushes, entrapment, decoys, diversions, meticulous ruses -- and they're effective.  These crooks are clever enough to, by ordinary means, give extraordinary heroes a run for their money.<br/><br/>As you can probably see, there's a number of issues here when the rubber hits the road, including:<br/><br/>A) The crook's Game needs to be a coherent plan -- it needs to make sense.  No goofy "WTF?" inducing plots.  (I'm not here to model the Golden Age; I want to take what they started, make it credible, and watch it move)<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> How can we expect the person playing the crooks to be as clever as all that, all the time?  He needs tools and models, and the game's design needs to provide.  And... well, how to provide such tools?<br/><br/>C) The thought of using prep-time to plan, giving the crook-player time to think about things, seems good -- but no plan ever survives contact with the enemy.  As soon as play starts, the plans are going to fall apart.  (We're barring railroading here.)  But we've got to keep these crooks effective, and effective against the heroes, at least enough to provide engaging challenges.<br/><br/>D) It seems necessary to allow the crook-player to "plan" retroactively.  Y'know, the hero goes to such-and-such place, does such-and-such thing, and the villain is like, "HA! That's exactly what I WANTED you to do!" and the net falls down, and next thing we know the hero is in the deathtrap.  But how to mechanize this such that it won't be abused, such that it doesn't just boil down to fiat, where the hero only succeeds because the crook-player decided not to spring one more thing spur of the moment?<br/><br/>E) The villain's Game also needs to be a sort of environment that the story takes place in.  The hero basically moves around <i>inside </i>the Game, as he investigates and tries to foil it.  So it needs to be sturdy enough that the hero can rough-house around in it without it falling down all the time, but it also needs to be legitimately foilable.<br/><br/>Any thoughts about any of this?<br/><br/>-Marshall                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184183/#Comment_184183" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T17:47:36+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  5:47PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about tables you can roll on at appropriate, mechanically induced points?<br/><br/>Like, if the hero has already snuck into the warehouse to save the dame, punch your face, and steal your gizmo, and the player has overcome the "villain's game rating" or whatever, then you as the GM can spend some "evil points" in order roll on the "trope table"<br/><br/>1.

The villain just needs a goal to work toward.  Couple that with in-game resources and/or metagame resources and maybe some key targets (a "shopping list" of things the villain will go after to help him succeed, to make the plan seem complex) and everything else is just color.<br/><br/>That's pretty much what "With Great Power..." does, coupled with a "can't win the war without losing some battles" rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184292/#Comment_184292" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T14:06:58+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  2:06PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.  I guess I better describe the conflict mechanics real quick.<br/><br/>So, at any given time, either the hero or the villain has "initiative."  The person with initiative is in the proactive mode, and the other is strictly in reactive.  The proactive player has authority over outcomes (within some rules &amp; boundaries).  <i>Unless </i>someone (anyone) calls for a conflict in response to any particular action declared by the proactive player.<br/><br/>When a conflict is declared, then we take that declared action and its intended effect, and that's the Goal.  Now we start piling on Concerns -- what could go wrong in this situation?  These are small-scale stakes in yes/no forms.  Let's say that Boss Gamboni has grabbed Lucy, the plucky reporter with eyes for the hero, and put a gun to her head as the hero, MagSeven, faces him down.  "Back off or your shweetheart is dead," Gamboni says, but MagSeven goes for his seven-shooters with his trademark quickdraw to put a bullet in Gamboni.  Possible Concerns include, "Will Gamboni be killed by his wounds?" "Will Lucy be shot?" "Will Lucy still feel the same about MagSeven after this?"<br/><br/>Now everyone takes their dice, and they bid dice to the individual Concerns, bidding for "yes" or "no."  Once all the bids are made, the dice will be rolled, and the highest die on each Concern decides which way it goes.  But before the dice are rolled, the proactive player gets a choice:  Follow Through (get your Goal and accept the consequences), or Hesitate (avoid the consequences, forfeit your Goal, and hand over the initiative to the other guy).<br/><br/>The idea is for the mechanics to ask you what you're willing to put at risk to accomplish your goals.  The person with nothing to lose is the most dangerous -- but do you really have nothing to lose?  This "what are you willing to risk?" question is what I want to be the central question of the game.<br/><br/>Now, once a conflict is declared, <i>there is no further action added</i> until the conflict is resolved by either Hesitation or Following Through.  The action all takes place in the "free play" between conflicts.  So all aspects of the crook's Game are introduced as either proactive or reactive things, depending on who had the initiative at the time.<br/><br/>So, Ralph, the IAWA style solution won't really work.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Hey Marshall, what do you want to be the determining factor on the effectiveness of Badguy Game at a given moment?</blockquote>\nOkay, so, by the rules, you need to have initiative in order to attain your aims &amp; goals.  (And the crooks have goals just as much as the heroes do.)  So, if you don't have it, you want to get it.  You do this by reacting to the proactive player in a way that manipulates him into a situation where serious things are at stake and you have more resources (yielding dice in conflicts) than him -- making him more likely to Hesitate.  So, effectiveness is a matter of pressuring the other guy to Hesitate, through manipulation of the situation and resources.  An effective Game is one that threatens things that are important to the hero, and drains his resources (ex. by inflicting injuries and fatigue, forcing him to use up his gadgets) and keeps your own resources in a place where you can bring them to bear (ex. by having goons, guns, traps, etc. at hand).<br/><br/><br/>I'm gonna have to take a look at With Great Power...  It's been on my list for a while anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
