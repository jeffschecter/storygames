Anyway, there are two obstacles that have been preventing it up 'til now: getting a group together that's interested and can coordinate their schedules, and grokking the rules. I've been having a really rough time wrapping my head around the rules--3 complete read-throughs and playing with the dice a bit (i.e., doing a mock conflict against myself with two characters) and i still didn't feel comfortable with all the nuances. Dunno if it's the way Vincent writes, or the way i learn, but something just wasn't clicking. <br/><br/>So, in order to make our first game as smooth as possible, and minimize the amount of time we spend figuring out teh rules, i decided to flowchart them. Which was a very interesting exercise, because i kept finding one more thing that interacted with some part. Plus, this was a learning exercise with OmniGraffle, too [which, for the record, absolutely rocks]. And, looking at the completed flowcharts, i see now why i was having so much trouble getting it all into my head--it's a lot more complex than i was expecting it to be. Rules light? yes. Simple? no. Of course, now i'm going to have to go flowchart some other games for comparison. Plus, this was really helpful--figuring out the flowchart finally got it all into my head, i think. And if not, well, that's the point of having the flowchart. <br/><br/>Anyway, i'm posting this here for three reasons: so that others can use it if it's helpful, so that i can find out if my grasp of the rules is accurate, and so i can find out if my flowcharting is sufficiently clear. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/ditv_resolution.pdf" rel="nofollow">Dogs in the Vineyard flowcharts</a><br/><br/>On the flowcharting side, i've left out a lot of implicit 'no's, and used some grouping boxes, so i'm curious to see if it's clear what's going on, especially from anyone who isn't already familiar with DitV. Also, everything is written in 2nd-person, though the actual person addressed shifts as you work through the flowchart (from actor to reactor), so i'll be interested to see if that is clear.<br/><br/>On the rules side, i've only made one intentional change to the rules-as-written: unless i've missed something, there's no need to actually change your Fallout Sum as you work through the consequences of Fallout; that's just Vincent's way of making a linear presentation of the rules with clear flow through the steps. That is, you don't actually use the adjusted Fallout Sum in any subsequent steps, it's just a way to make proceeding to the next step always use the same criteria. With a flowchart, i can just direct you appropriately. If i'm wrong about this (i.e., i missed some reason the actual Sum needs to be changed, other than as a criteria for going to the next step), please let me know. Otherwise, any other changes to the rules are unintentional, so please point them out to me. <br/><br/>Oh, two other things. I haven't included the rules for a follow-up conflict due to someone dying because of Stakes, with no actual Fallout. And the rules seem to say that, even if nobody cares about the consequences to an NPC, if there is no follow-up conflict, you technically should still figure Fallout for that NPC as usual. So that's what the flowchart says. But i suspect that in the case where you don't care about the NPC and there is no obvious follow-up conflict, you can just throw the NPC's Fallout dice away, right?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135907/#Comment_135907" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T22:52:35+00:00" title="March 21, 2008 10:52PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm having trouble opening that pdf.

Yeah...hrmph, my website ISP seems to be down. Turns out it's a scheduled maintenance outage, supposed to be resolved by 9am PDT. <i>edit: as of 7am CDT, the server is back up. And you were absolutely right--the file was corrupted or something. I've uploaded a fresh copy, and it should be working fine, now.</i><br/><br/><i>edit 9am CDT: and i just uploaded a new version, because i realized i'd inadvertantly shown esclation and bringing in new traits and things as only occurring during a See, not a Raise. So, look again if you'd already looked at it.</i><br/><br/>No, i'm referring to the fact that, if you have a fallout sum of 12-15, and fail to See it with your Body in 3 or fewer dice, it says to "bump your current Fallout Sum up to 16 and continue." The next step starts with "Is your Fallout Sum 16 or higher?" but doesn't, unless i've missed something, actually use said Fallout Sum, except as a qualifier to get to the step in the first place. Likewise, if you've gotten to that step, and fail to get medical attention, it tells you to bump your Fallout Sum to 20, and proceed to the next step, which starts out with "Is your Fallout Sum 20 or higher?". And, again, doesn't seem to actually use that number, except as a qualifier to get to that step. So, it seems like, functionally, it's identical to if, instead of changing your Fallout Sum, it just said "go to the next step", and said next step started out with "Is your Fallout Sum X or higher, or were you directed here by a previous step?". But, again, i might be missing something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136031/#Comment_136031" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-23T10:40:48+00:00" title="March 23, 2008 10:40AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>I'm having trouble opening that pdf.

For instance, the first branch doesn't explain why you would pick one arrow over the other and I am not entirely sure the arrows are pointed the right way...<br/>[snip because of post-length limitations]<br/></blockquote>\nFirst branch: yeah, there are better ways to do that. Thing is, you actually choose *both* branches, according to the rules. I meant the lack of choice criteria on the two arrows to be read as "go this way *and* this way"--because, per semi-standard flowchart styling, you take any path that doesn't have some qualifier to stop you from taking it. But i suppose it would be clearer to direct the user through one box and then the other.<br/><br/>Size: keep in mind that it's designed for 11"x17" paper, so if you shrink it down to fit on letter-size or A4, yeah, it's gonna be tiny. The smallest text on there is 9pt, or maybe 8pt, so it's not that small, really. And most of it is 10pt (IIRC). <br/><br/>"Bunch of bubbles": not sure which you mean, but if you mean instances like the various relationships--the ideas was to include *everything* germaine to the details of the resolution mechanics, so you don't need to consult the rulebook at all for that. So i didn't want to just have "relationships" without the qualifiers for exactly when various sorts of relationships apply. And since they're slightly different for different categories of relationships, it doesn't consolidate very well. I think that's about as succinct as i can get it. Part of it is also an aesthetic thing--i could've just as easily put that same content into a single cell as a list. To my mind, it's a bunch of different little options more than it's a list of aspects of one option, but that's pretty minor. Is that what you're talking about, or is there something else specific that you'd consolidate?<br/><br/>Usefulness as an introduction to the system: Dubious, based on experience. I find it immensely helpful, if only because it puts everything on one page, so i can see the whole thing at once, rather than flipping back and forth across 20-odd pages of text. One of the players seems to reference it, one seems overwhelmed (but no moreso than after she'd merely read the rules), and one i don't know about. <br/><br/>As for he concern that it lacks "step-by-step simplicity"--well, i'm not sure the written rules are any better in that regard. Which is why i felt the need to create this in the first place. [I just discovered this weekend that a group that's been playing for quite a while had read right past the distinction between giving instead of raising and giving instead of seeing--and i don't blame them: it's just mentioned quickly in passing, and that section isn't very clearly structured, so i didn't notice that distinction until at least my 3rd iteration of the flowchart.] But, that aside, i'm not sure learning the conflict resolution system incompletely, and then adding the details in later, is particularly helpful. Probably depends on learning style. I'd have a harder time unlearning "absolutes" that turn out to be not so absolute, than just learning the whole complicated mess at once. Others probably do really well learning iteratively like that. Personally, i think once you get past the level of non-detail of "raise with two dice, those affected see with as many dice as required to match or exceed; next person", you need to go directly to the whole shebang--the intermediate levels of detail add confusion not clarity, to the final understanding. Specifically, instead of explaining two-person conflict and then how it changes for multi-person conflict, i think it would've been much clearer to me from the start if he'd just explained multi-person conflict, since 2-person conflict would naturally flow from that (that is, if you use the multi-person conflict for 2 people, the simple lack of participants makes all the necessary changes for you). It might also have prevented the ambiguity as to whether the very first Raise of a conflict is made by the initiator or the person with the highest Best Roll. <br/><br/>Anyway, i need to make a couple minor tweaks, based on having figured out other little niggling details, and your (collective) feedback, and i'll upload a new version. And i'd be happy to share the source file--but you'll need OmniGraffle to do anything with it. I'll upload it, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
