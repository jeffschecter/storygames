                    All the talk of Dr Who has got me thinking. So...<br/>
<br/>
The Doctor is the most interesting character, so everyone would have to get a turn playing him. This leads me to think of Ron Edwards' game, Dr Chaos, which he talked about on the Forge last year. It was played with cards and, if I remember rightly, there's one hand of cards which is the "Dr Chaos" hand, which different people can play throughout the game. Perhaps you could do something similar with the Doctor.<br/>
<br/>
You have to put the Doctor in moral dilemmas and he has to face the consequences of them.<br/>
<br/>
The Assistant has to be a character too and she has to go and get into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
And ask the Doctor questions.<br/>
<br/>
And, wherever they land at the start of the game, they need to spend a while exploring it, so there's room for some nice communal setting building there.<br/>
<br/>
Does that sound right? What else?<br/>

                            Nowadays, the Doctor almost always has only one companion, but historically he has had as many as four.<br/>
<br/>
The companions would be the PC's.<br/>
<br/>
The Doctor would be a completely mechanically-determined NPC (not under GM control, if there even is one) whose actions are determined by drawing from a deck of cards with typically doctor-like things written on them.<br/>
<br/>
If the Doctor's actions SEEM nonsensical at the time, then the events are narrated to MAKE them sensible after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
The one-doctor one-assistant model is, I think, ill suited to typical RPG social systems.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, it makes a PERFECT situation for 1-1 play.  The person playing the Doctor has no authority to introduce new elements, but all authority for explaining their meaning; the companion player has no authority to assign meaning to things, but has all authority for introducing new elements.                        </div>

<br/>
That's a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
My Who game would seem just a little bit cheap. Locations should rarely be flashy (Ace running around housing estates always seemed interesting to me). That's part of the Britishness, the BBCness. It's old factories and quarries, tower blocks and tatty offices.<br/>
<br/>
While that could just be color, it'd be nice if there was a budget to spend.<br/>

                            I'd give the companions stats that refelected how much trouble they could get into before the Doctor was able to rescue them. How strong a complication you could introduce would be based on that stat, but risks the chance that your character gets into trrouble at that point. Getting into trouble has to risk something bad; an injury that reduces your effectiveness, potential death (remember Adric!) or, worst of all, getting kicked off the TARDIS.<br/>
<br/>
The game should start with no companions at all, and no Doctor. You create a planet with a situation brewing, and create characters. You're trying to make your character appealing enough to become a companion, when the Doctor arrives. If your character doesn't make the cut on Planet 1, you have another character on the next planet. If you get kicked off the TARDIS or die, you make a new character on the next planet. You can also swap your existing companion for a different character.                        </div>

One possible thought, purely as brainstorming - each player could claim one incarnation of the Timelord and play in rotation.  One story is player A playing the Hartnel doctor, the next features player B playing the Davidson doctor, then player C and Baker, then back again.  The other players play companions, with (possibly) a rotating GM.                        </div>

                            It would also be important, whether the game was a tongue-in-cheek slapstick Troughtonesque Doctor, a deadly serious Davidsonian Doctor, or a postmodern, almost dadaist ColinBakerite Doctor.  The nature of the Doctor would have a lot of bearing on the tone of the game.<br/>
<br/>
I'm seriously digging Eccleston's Doctor, and finding that his portrayal offers more roleplaying opportunities than any previous.                        </div>

                            On the idea of playing companions: it's cool and it would make a good game. The thing is, I'd want to play the Doctor. I just would. That would be the fun part, for me.<br/><br/>I really liked this...
<blockquote>That being said, it makes a PERFECT situation for 1-1 play.

Yes. I was thinking of having three basic players (which could be doubled up if needed): the Doctor, who does pretty much what you're saying; the Companion, who asks questions and whose job it is to get into trouble so that the Doctor rescues her; and the Villain, who basically throws adversity at everyone.<br/><br/>Ah, and the incarnations, good point.<br/><br/><i>It starts on Saturday!</i>.<br/><br/>All right, I'll calm down.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>
