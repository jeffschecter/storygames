Although the historical coverage is a bit exhausting, most of it is really interesting and it may spark further reading on the indicated sources. <br/><br/>One of the things I've wondered is if one could assemble a D&amp;D-like game by copy-pasting from earlier sources. Here's an example from 1879 on the role of what would come to be the DM:<br/><br/><i> "[The Referee] should bear in mind the principle that anything can be attempted. The advisability of an attempt is another thing, and one that it is the object of the War Game to make evident to all concerned by results."<br/><br/>"The decision in all such cases devolves more or less upon the Referee himself, but should seldom be so rendered as entirely to foreclose the question; it should rather be formulated into a ratio, in which both sides receive due consideration, and under which, by suitably consulting the dice, a decision can be arrived at without prejudice to either side."<br/><br/>"Table I will be found of great convenience for reference in these premises. It by no means covers all the cases liable to arise in action, but, to say the least, it is suggestive. In all such cases a large discretion must be exercised, and, when tabulated data do not exist or are inadequate, the Referee must originate."<br/><br/>"It will thus be seen that upon the Referee, in particular, will depend the successful realization of very much of the vast amount of interest and information which may be derived from a study so comprehensive. And it should, of course, be needless to state that the players themselves should enter into the spirit of the game, and supplement to their utmost every effort of the Referee to perform his arduous duties."</i><br/><br/>- Charles Totten, 1879, \xabStrategos: a Series of American Games of War\xbb: <a href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006111870" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006111870</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438260/#Comment_438260" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-11T10:24:58+00:00" title="September 11, 2014 10:24AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just finished reading the book, after months of trying.

Players start as a Fighter, Magic-User, Cleric, or Thief. They may choose to be a human, elf, dwarf, half-elf, or even a hobbit. They must decide to be lawful, neutral, or chaotic. There is never any winner. In a good  campaign players start in a town. First, they must get a room at one of the several inns. Then, they usually go to a general store to pick up some equipment such as rope, sacks, etc. If they have any money left, they'll go to a tavern, have a drink, and try to hire some men. How well they fare at this is determined by charisma, one of the abilities. The other abilities are intelligence, strength, wisdom, dexterity and constitution. They'll then begin to ask towns people about the surroundings, about any legends, etc. The next day bright and early they'll pack up and set out down the road. If they have bad luck, <br/>sometimes they even have to get a job to keep from starving! All this takes a lot of work and time for the referee, but it's more than worth it! The most stimulating part of the game is the fact that anything can happen. Nothing is impossible. Even when you are standing between a cliff and a troll, there is still hope, perhaps Levitation boots! Over a hundred monsters are provided for, from trolls, ores, zombies, werewolves, vampires, dragons, gargoyles, rocs, and giant purple worms, to hell hounds, rust monsters, giant slugs, and even tyranosaurus rexes and giant tics. Whether you' re exploring the depths of the dungeons, roaming in some forsaken wilderness, or being pursued by an evil wizard in an intricate castle, I'm sure you'll be having one heck of a good time!"<br/><br/>- Space Gamer Magazine <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, 1975<br/><a href="http://archive.org/stream/space-gamer-02/Space_Gamer_02_djvu.txt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://archive.org/stream/space-gamer-02/Space_Gamer_02_djvu.txt</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438352/#Comment_438352" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-15T04:49:37+00:00" title="September 15, 2014  4:49AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing that I've been wondering...<br/><br/>If indeed we can find a lot of dots that connect chess to wargames to D&amp;D, what other connections can we trace to other RPGs that don't seem to fit into this frame? Mostly, I feel that the wargaming legacy considers narrative only as an emergent quality, but we can certainly find other ways to get to RPGs from a more story-driven approach.<br/><br/>Also, if chess is the classic strategy game behind D&amp;D, what about Go as another archetype in the evolution of gaming? One where unique shapes are dynamically created out of small moves that grow into something unexpected? Like Fiasco or In A Wicked Age. What is there beyond the torch that D&amp;D and many others continue to carry?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438354/#Comment_438354" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-15T07:32:02+00:00" title="September 15, 2014  7:32AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Historical wargaming has narrative directly in it - history.<br/><br/>Go wasn't a big influence on the creators of RPGs, also that's not what happens in In A Wicked Age ("small" moves there aren't contested so are never mechanically significant) or Fiasco (the "size" of all moves in Fiasco are exactly the same.)<br/><br/>Yes, I'm the wet blanket again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438356/#Comment_438356" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-15T09:36:34+00:00" title="September 15, 2014  9:36AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            History sometimes has narrative, but it's accidental or a matter of interpretation after the fact (as in many RPGs).<br/><br/>I'm bringing up Go not as a possible influence, but as a kind of gaming archetype that is considerably different from chess.

I will just say that it's not a question of mastery, these games represent two very distinct archetypes. For those who are not familiar with Go, I suggest taking a look at the sidebar at <a href="http://www.kiseido.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kiseido.com/</a>. Some quotes from there:\n<blockquote>Unlike chess and its different pieces and complicated rules, Go is played with black and white stones equal in value, seemingly making it compatible with the binary nature of computers. Since the aim of a move is to control the most territory, the optimal move yields the maximum amount of territory -- a simple counting procedure and a chore computers excel at. Yet in spite of the efforts of the world's best programmers over the last 30 years, the level of computer Go remains about that of a human who has studied Go for a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Go is to Western chess what philosophy is to double entry accounting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Those interested in impressing others with their intelligence play chess. Those who would settle for being chic play backgammon. Those who wish to become individuals of quality, take up Go.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438372/#Comment_438372" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T08:00:21+00:00" title="September 16, 2014  8:00AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I've looked at it, it's nonsense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438383/#Comment_438383" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T11:51:30+00:00" title="September 16, 2014 11:51AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2014 11:55AM by Paul_T.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, man!

This cause subsequent campaigns and slightly later the D&amp;D rules to rapidly become something different. <br/><br/>With wargames you play the game. You play chess, you play go, you play Chainmail. However you experience Blackmoor, Greyhawk, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The wargame rules that lie at the heart of many RPGs are there to make resolving certain types of actions (commonly combat and magic) fun and interesting. But they are not the point like it is in a wargame.

My opinion is that a person should use the rules that suits them and their group. Use the rules that "clicks" so that they fade into the backgroup of what happening at the table. Which one is "best" is purely personal preference but it is an important preference that makes the rest possible for an individual or a group.<br/><br/>But the thing to keep in mind that the rules are just a tool, they are not the point of tabletop roleplaying. So when a players wants to attempt something that is not clearly resolved by the campaign's rules then it is up to the referee or group to make a ruling that is accurate, fair, and consistent with the rest of the elements of the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438660/#Comment_438660" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-24T11:23:56+00:00" title="September 24, 2014 11:23AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the players could attempt anything their character could do even if there wasn't a specific rule to cover the action</blockquote>\nHave you read the quote from Strategos?

When to the focus was on creating an accurate simulation of military command. It wasn't until the Blackmoor Campaign by Arneson and the Greyhawk Campaign by Gygax that it came together to where the point of the game was the  general experience of being in another place in an interesting situation. With Totten's game you were there to learn how to command. <br/><br/>Dave Arneson innovation of tabletop roleplaying is not in mechanics it is in focus. A shift away from a playing a game to presenting an experience. <br/><br/>Because of focus Totten was writing about a simulation using wargame rules, Wesley Braustein is also a Wargame. Arneson's Blackmoor campaign started out as a wargame but then shifted into being the first tabletop roleplaying campaign when the dominant focus became the Blackmoor Dungeons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/increment" title="increment"><img alt="increment" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/increment">increment</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438675/#Comment_438675" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-24T22:25:29+00:00" title="September 24, 2014 10:25PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael Korns would inject himself into this thread and remind everyone that his work brought wargames down to the individual level, to turns that lasted only seconds where you made decisions for a specific character in a military situation, back in 1966. And that both the Twin Cities and Lake Geneva crowd knew his game intimately. <br/><br/>It's futile to try to draw a line in the sand and say that Arneson's Blackmoor or Gygax's Greyhawk transmuted gaming from being about wars to being about roles (or characters). People pushed the envelope of wargaming in the late 1960s, and plenty of practices we would happily call wargames "presented experiences" or involved playing characters. People played characters in Midgard, in Coventry, in Hyboria, in Braunstein, in Diplomacy, in Fight in the Skies, in countless other games we should label wargames. The revolution, if there was a revolution, occurred after D&amp;D came out, when both the authors and the fan communities took the game to places that were not obvious in its original formulation. When they started playing at worlds, say. <br/><br/>This is indeed one of the major arguments of Playing at the World, that the line between wargames and role-playing games is hard to draw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438677/#Comment_438677" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-25T00:06:59+00:00" title="September 25, 2014 12:06AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True that.

Exactly what makes SPI's Freedom in the Galaxy a wargame, and WEG's Star Wars the Roleplaying Game an RPG?  Or something similar like SPI's War of the Ring verse Iron Crown's Middle Earth Roleplaying. The only thing I can see is the focus. <br/><br/>Another example is Melee/Wizardry vs the Fantasy Trip. Melee was a wargame. The Fantasy Trip was an RPG. The difference lies in their focus. A wargame you play the game, a RPG you participate in an experience. <br/><br/>From reading your book, I think it a little clearer then you give yourself credit for. Blackmoor is where the shift in focus occurred. The Greyhawk Campaign was the first campaign that started with tabletop roleplaying in mind. <br/><br/>I agree it was not a stark difference compared to everything else that was going on. It still not a stark difference today. Many gamers play several RPGs as a glorified wargame with a focus on winning combats. Many wargames, like Warhammer or Battletech, have a rich back story that the players invest in. <br/><br/>And from somebody standing at the moment in time in the upper midwest it would be just another variant in a sea of interesting things other people were doing with wargames. It only with hindsight we can see how it lead to the start of the tabletop roleplaying hobby. That the shift was from trying to beat an opponent in a scenario to experiencing an imagined setting where anything can be attempted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/increment" title="increment"><img alt="increment" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/increment">increment</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438691/#Comment_438691" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-25T09:01:36+00:00" title="September 25, 2014  9:01AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear what you're saying. Maybe we could put it this way. Wargames are about approximating the experience of command in times of war. Wargames in the Hellwig tradition (which include more or less all of AH and SPI) do so by letting players directly manipulate pieces representing their forces located on a visible board. Wargames in the Reiswitz tradition (which include Totten, Korns, Braunstein) do so by letting players act as the character of a commander. We know that RPGs emerged from people playing games in this latter tradition. They emerged when the referee - and those games always needed referees - allowed the focus of the simulation to drift away from issuing commands to military forces. Players could always "attempt anything" in this tradition, but the duty of the referee is to keep the game directed at the "general idea." Wesely's Braunstein, Arneson's Blackmoor and some of Tony Bath's experimental wargames showed that new avenues of creativity were opened up when the referee let things slide. Arneson's Blackmoor in particular provided a focus for these games other than winning a war: personal progression, the increase in power of a character. The dungeon helped too, certainly. Games that combined these principles very rapidly adopted play elements that looked little like the precedents of wargames.<br/><br/>My point was that while we can create tidy explanations in hindsight, it wasn't tidy at the time. When D&amp;D was published, these ideas were at best half-baked, and it took the community some time experimenting with the game for these distinctions to become rigid enough to draw genre boundaries. Some people picked up the D&amp;D booklets and tried to play a wargame with them - and it worked, because the tools in the box could still be used to make wargames.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439188/#Comment_439188" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T10:54:50+00:00" title="October  7, 2014 10:54AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2014 11:22AM by Ricardo Tavares.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another interesting quote given the recurring "X is not an RPG" discussion:\n<blockquote>In short, we are talking about role-playing games in which we try to represent several international actors, usually governments but sometimes other factions, against a world background in which a myriad of forces and influences are at work.

The overall argument is that D&amp;D emerged from the confluence of a number of interrelated cultural threads and social groups, including fantasy &amp; science fiction fandom, Avalon Hill and miniatures wargaming, Diplomacy play-by-mail circles, and the 1960s cultural penchant for the medieval. I think he says it was anticipated (but not directly influenced) by 19th century kriegspiel traditions, which also evinced a concern for being able to "try to do anything" in the game-world. I think it's an impressive piece of scholarship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal" title="chirinebakal"><img alt="chirinebakal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal">chirinebakal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439483/#Comment_439483" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-16T07:46:17+00:00" title="October 16, 2014  7:46AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm fascinated to hear what you all think of the book!

In the game, one person (the "GM") asks the other person if they want to win or lose.  The other person answers.  The GM gives them exactly what they asked for.  End of game.  <br/><br/>I realized that these games could be strung out in series.  The name was changed to "Succeed or Fail?" and I counted each question as a "scene goal" in a larger narrative.  While the player could choose for the character to fail in the fiction, of course there was zero chance of player failure in the metagame, which was rather the point of the exercise.<br/><br/>It was parodic on purpose, but philosophically it presages the drive toward abstraction in mechanics that we have witnessed across major regions of the industry over the last ten or twenty years.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
