It is meant to be crass, misogynistic and shocking, as any exploration of the objectification of women needs to be.  I've been thinking about RPGs as an educational experience lately, and one of my design intentions is to have the players really feel the effects.<br/>Also, I felt the "Fair Warning" section was important.  I don't want anyone saying I blindsided them with a game that should be scratched on a bathroom wall.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite><br/>Please send me your paypal address posthaste, so I may get you that dollar.

But that's why this is v1.0.  I cranked this out in about 90 minutes, so a more finished draft needs to escape my typing fingers.<br/><br/>The more I think about this game, the more Nicotine Girls creeps into my thoughts  Any influence on this draft, however, would have been purely subconscious.   I have never read The Contenders, and so I must hang my head in geek-shame.  One of the conscious influences was the Voice of the Revolution interview with Julia Ellingboe, and her take on the difficult subject matter in Steal Away Jordan and the influence it had on many of the players she spoke with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112632/#Comment_112632" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T04:09:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2007  4:09AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, you could do a game about strippers that wasn't all ridrunkulous*.

I came to the understanding that this song can basically be summed up as "I'm better than you because I have nicer breasts."  I then asked myself on my long ride home "What would it be like to live that way?  To have your self worth tied to your bra size and how much attention some stranger is willing to pay you?"  It was a sad place.  It was a little place that said "Maybe I am nothing more than these."<br/>  For someone who has never been to a strip joint, I have known a fair number of strippers.  Yes, most of them were in college, doing a job that payed the bills with a minimal time commitment.  Most of the strippers I've known have had a healthy self-esteem, and were making bigger and better plans for the rest of their lives.  That wasn't the place I saw when I was thinking about this game.  I could definately make a game about those women, and it would be more light-hearted, hopeful and definately less offensive.  <br/>  Those women aren't who I was writing about.  While they make their living by exploiting the idiocy of men in the face of attractive women.  I cannot think of a single woman in that group (of those I have known) that has resorted to prostitution, for example.  I was writing about a much smaller group, a tiny minority of the strippers I have known who didn't have that going for them.  I wanted to write about women who had been wounded by the objectification.  They message has wormed it's way into their soul that they are nothing more than meat and they should make the best of it.  Like I said, it's not a happy place.  But the larger subject is not a happy one either.<br/>  What I envisioned Attitude as, and if I go forward with this concept I will explain it more fully, is the inverse of self-esteem.  It shows on the surface as "You're not better than me" machisma, but it is really a visceral reaction to a little voice inside saying "maybe you aren't anything more than T&amp;A."  I'm contemplating another gauge (Jaded) that indicates how deeply that idea has taken hold, how close you are to simply giving up hope of being anything more than a stripper and sometimes prostitute.<br/>  I feel some kind of obligation to take this further, but frankly I don't know if I want to live with this game for the time it would take to do a full production.  Also, as my current main project (Freshmen) is also about people being bad to one another, I'm not sure I really want to get a reputation as "That guy who writes games that hurt."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112768/#Comment_112768" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T10:52:51+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 10:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>"That guy who writes games that hurt."</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Frankly it is not like there are no angels on that pin already.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112771/#Comment_112771" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-07T11:01:43+00:00" title="December  7, 2007 11:01AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our group genuinely will reject a system based on it "not hurting enough."
