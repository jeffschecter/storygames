I'm just coming back to roleplaying after some time, hoping to be part of a game over the holidays.  But a couple of different threads have got me thinking: <a href="http://rob-donoghue.livejournal.com/266898.html" rel="nofollow">Rob Donoghue makes an excellent observation on White Wolf's Changeling court system</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4923" rel="nofollow">Don Corcoran's Wizard setting burner</a>.<br/><br/>So combining these two, I was thinking about questions for creating characters that are dealing with some sort of lose or trauma (hence the "Dead Inside" in the subject even though I haven't read the book yet).<br/><br/>My first crack at them was good, I thought.  But I found something interesting, the four stages worked better with the Changeling structure backwards.<br/><br/>Depression: What was your old life like?<br/>Bargaining: What did you do in Arcadia?<br/>Anger: How did you escape?<br/>Denial: What do you want now?<br/><br/>But looking over Don's thread, I realized that my questions lacked punch.  My second pass tried to make them more personal.<br/><br/>What will you never let be taken from you again?<br/>What will you never do again just to survive?<br/>What will you never let happen to someone else again?<br/>What will you never tell someone else again?<br/><br/>I'm probably never going to use these ideas, but it's bugging me that the questions aren't awesome enough.

I think that's what I was feeling about the first set of questions but couldn't put into words.<br/><br/>Your point about the second set is very interesting.  Maybe they'd still work (modified) if they weren't all there was about a character. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2120" rel="nofollow">An idea that I had last January, about 1-2-3 characters</a> might balance the negative questions out a bit.  Starting outside and working inward the 4 questions, maybe 3 Contracts (more freeform than in the book, but basically Contracts are super powers that you have because Shadow or Autumn made an agreement and you've found out how to bend that agreement in your favor), 2 concept spots (fairy seeming, and human mask).  I think I like the idea of the middle being empty.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>I really like question-based character generation, but your second batch doesn't make me feel like I'd know what my character would necessarily do.

The questions dictated the issues of scenes that the character would go through.<br/><br/>But the more I think about it, the less I want to build a whole new game.  More likely just looking for a way to get flags from the players through pointed questions.

I've asked questions of my own characters to tease them out a bit more.  It's a pretty powerful tool that can be used in any game, as long as you're okay with the tie-in being person/group-based rather than system-based.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
