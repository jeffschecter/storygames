I had heard some nifty things about the original edition of the game, but early reports on the game text were disappointing.  But now they were fixed!  Hooray!  Plus, I discovered recently that Crystal really likes SF, so long as it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s more than just spaceships and laser blasters.  Well, that sounds a lot like <i>Shock:</i>.  (It also sounds like <i>Sign In Stranger</i>, which is third in our current game rotation.)<br/><br/>So, recently, we sat down to play <i>Shock:</i>.   Due to fatigue over several nights and learning the system, it took us three sessions to play through the entire story.  I think that we would be able to work much faster in the future.  However, I will report the whole run in this post.<br/><br/><b>Tools of the Trade</b><br/><br/><a href="http://darkomengames.com/files/ActualPlay/Shock/ShockAndBeer.jpg" rel="nofollow">Shock: colored beer</a>\xe2\u20ac\u201djust because<br/><br/>Our Shock: soundtrack<br/><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/sonoprintprotostar" rel="nofollow">Part 1</a><br/><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/michael_sandler_shelter" rel="nofollow">Part 2</a><br/><br/><br/><b>Constructing the Grid</b><br/><br/>In <i>Shock:</i>, the players begin by constructing a Shock/Issue Grid (or Grid, for short).  An Issue is a real-life concern of one of the players, while a Shock is a major way in which the imaginary world differs from ours.  In the 1.1 rules, each player can propose one or two Issues, and then the group agrees on a single Shock.  Then the group divides Ownership of the Issues and the Shock.  If you Own something, it means that you have final say over the details of how that thing is expressed in the game world.  Finally, you decide on a Shock/Issue intersection that is interesting to you, and that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s where you will make your character.<br/><br/>For our game, we said that we would deal with Issues that were important to us but weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t hot-button issues.  That way we could keep the intensity of the game down.<br/><br/>We lied to ourselves.  Yeah, it happens.<br/><br/>So, our Issues were Littering, Public Education, Mood Suppressing Drugs, and Political Corruption.<br/><br/>Our Shock was \xe2\u20ac\u0153All Thoughts are Public\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  This means that anyone can sense your thoughts, just like hearing or seeing you.  As the game went on, we settled on various sense impressions for thoughts, which were a combination of sight and sound.<br/><br/>Then we spent some time making up details about our world.  These are called Minutiae, and this is a great idea.  With some quick brainstorming, we were able to have a reasonably realized world.  I won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t bore you with our entire list of Minutiae, but here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a sampling:<br/><br/>--Thought residue can be left around for others to encounter.  This is called \xe2\u20ac\u0153littering\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/>--Everyone takes a drug called Litox to control thought leakage and prevent littering.<br/>--Thoughts are contagious.<br/>--Redheads are trouble.  Everyone knows it.<br/>--Karma Police patrol the populace.<br/>--Government is theocracy that combines Buddhist doctrine, Catholic hierarchy, and Islamic sharia law.<br/>--\xe2\u20ac\u0153Dosing\xe2\u20ac\x9d on Litox is an act of prayer.<br/><br/>Finally, the group needs to define two sets of opposed values that will be used as Praxis scales.  These are the ways to \xe2\u20ac\u0153get stuff done\xe2\u20ac\x9d in the game world.  Our Praxis scales were Personal Happiness vs. Corporate Responsibility and Politics vs. Sex.<br/><br/>So, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s <i>Equilibrium</i> without gun kata, and everyone\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a telepath. <br/><br/>Nice, huh?<br/><br/><br/><b>Enter the Characters</b><br/><br/>Here are the characters that we hashed out.  :<br/><br/>Martin<br/>Played by Seth<br/>Shock/Issue:  All Thoughts are Public/Political Corruption<br/><br/>Personal Happiness vs. Corporate Responsibility 7<br/>Politics vs. Sex 4<br/><br/>Starting Features:  Mad Prophet, Ex-Priest, Redhead<br/><br/>Links:  My heresy is the truth; long, wild hair<br/><br/>Story Goal:  I want to expose the Hierarchy\xe2\u20ac\u2122s corruption.<br/><br/>Antagonist:  The Karma Police, played by Crystal<br/><br/><br/>Kanjo Teki<br/>Played by Crystal<br/>Shock/Issue:  Mood Suppressing Drugs/Political Corruption<br/><br/>Personal Happiness vs. Corporate Responsibility 3<br/>Politics vs. Sex 8<br/><br/>Starting Features:  Redhead; Fiery Personality; Loves to Sing<br/><br/>Links:  Wants to find mother; Honesty<br/><br/>Story Goal:  I want to be myself.<br/><br/>Antagonist:  The Hierarchy, played by Gabrielle<br/><br/><br/>Mirrim<br/>Played by Gabrielle<br/>Shock/Issue:  Littering/Political Corruption<br/><br/>Personal Happiness vs. Corporate Responsibility 5<br/>Politics vs. Sex 8<br/><br/>Starting Features:  Busty redhead; Intensely happy and excited; snake breeder<br/><br/>Links:  pet snake named Mei-mei; my friend Constable Tam<br/><br/>Story Goal:  I want to establish a life as a successful thought graffiti artist.<br/><br/>Antagonist:  her supervisor Alan, played by Seth<br/><br/><br/><b>I Wish We Had A Cool Title</b><br/><br/>Our story doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have a cool title, though perhaps we could invent one.

(Aside:  in real life, this is apparently much more challenging than it seems.  Certain species, like the king snake, need to be in just the right mood, or they will attack each other instead of mating.  Fun fact for the day.)  Her joy spills out as litter.  Immediately, Alan is there, using this infraction to force her to have sex with him.<br/><br/>Conflict\xe2\u20ac\u201d5 credits<br/>[Protag:  Stop Alan from reporting littering\xe2\u20ac\u201dSex\xe2\u20ac\u201dLost<br/>[Antag:  Force Mirrim to have sex with him\xe2\u20ac\u201dSex\xe2\u20ac\u201dWon<br/><br/>(Traumatic sexuality:  <a href="denied:\xe2\u20ac\x9dhttp://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24600.msg239267#msg239267\xe2\u20ac\x9d" rel="nofollow">check</a>)<br/><br/>We agreed that, if this were a movie,  the shot would be of him dragging her down behind one of the snake cages, where you saw the two snakes entwined.

But now, her thought sense is radically expanded, while her sense of reality is fading.

Wow!  After the first round of scenes, I had serious doubts about the story being satisfying, which I expressed to the other players.  It felt like we were all over the place and that there was no way that we would actually be able to harmonize our divergent tales.  I also expressed the opinion that the issues that we really wanted to address weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t actually on the Grid.  In particular, I pointed out the large number of Minutiae that had to do with procreation.  (I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t list those off.)<br/><br/>In retrospect, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if these concerns were accurate or not.  I am glad that I raised them, though.  I think that we all worked a little harder to make sure that our stories knit together.  And, to my surprise, everything wrapped up in a satisfying way.  I was happy with the end of the story.<br/><br/>We also noticed the different character arcs in relationship to the larger society.  Martin started off outside the \xe2\u20ac\u0153system\xe2\u20ac\x9d and was personally conquered by the system, while still overthrowing it for others.  In contrast, Kanjo started off locked into the \xe2\u20ac\u0153system\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and, while she couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t make any lasting social change, she was able to get free herself.<br/><br/>Mirrim was the odd duck in all this.  Her story was much more personal, largely due to the fact that her Antagonist was an individual and not a large social force.  It felt like she illustrated the \xe2\u20ac\u0153common man\xe2\u20ac\x9d playing out her life against the backdrop of the larger social destruction being caused by the other characters. <br/><br/>Crystal really liked the graphic design of the various sheets.  By the way, Joshua, in case you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know this, the downloadable Antagonist sheet is apparently missing a Credit box.  I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t remember when I downloaded this, so you may have already fixed this.<br/><br/>I had read about the \xe2\u20ac\u0153large\xe2\u20ac\x9d scenes in <i>Shock:</i>, but I was surprised to experience them myself.  2-4 Scenes doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t feel like a lot, but there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s actually a lot of content that can be packed into those scenes, especially if you riff off the other players\xe2\u20ac\u2122 scenes.  Crystal commented that she\xe2\u20ac\u2122d like the ability to play longer, so maybe we will try another game with the intent of stepping through several iterations of the game cycle, treating each Story Goal as a Chapter Goal or somesuch thing.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the orthogonal goals.  That meant that each dice roll could potentially have four outcomes, without escalation or rerolls from Links.  That structure enables the \xe2\u20ac\u0153large\xe2\u20ac\x9d scenes that I discussed earlier.  I also enjoyed the need to allocate dice between \xe2\u20ac\u0153gaining my goal\xe2\u20ac\x9d and \xe2\u20ac\u0153interfering with his\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  Very cool.<br/><br/><b>Musing on Shock:</b><br/><br/>After the game, I raised a question.  Does <i>Shock:</i> front-load too much?  As I looked at the story that we had developed, it seemed to me that the game was good for allowing us to <i>make statements</i> about the various Issues that we had placed on the Grid.  However, I wondered if it would be as good for <i>exploring questions</i> about those Issues.  Setup for <i>Shock:</i>  feels a bit like building a maze, winding up some characters, and seeing where they come out.  <br/><br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve found that the strongest post-game reflection that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve had was the result of emergent issues rising from the game, not the result of front-loaded issues established prior to play.  It doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t feel like <i>Shock:</i> can easily transcend its front-loaded issues to encourage the emergence of new issues.<br/><br/>Or, to put the question another way, is gameplay in <i>Shock:</i> trapped by the Grid?<br/><br/>I do have a counterpoint.  My fellow players and I are\xe2\u20ac\xa6opinionated, let us say.  So, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to have an Issue where we don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t already have an opinion.  This could be the reason for my feeling of being able to <i>express</i>, not <i>explore</i>.  If we were to consciously choose Issues where we had questions, perhaps we would have found ourselves doing more exploring.<br/><br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d be interested in hearing from other <i>Shock:</i> players about this issue.<br/><br/><br/><b>Conclusion</b><br/><br/>I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want the previous section to sound like I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m griping.  We really enjoyed <i>Shock:</i>.  It felt properly SF, like we were given the right tools to make this sort of story.  The story felt like a <i>Brave New World</i> of our very own, a story which provoked thought about the Issues that were the underpinnings of the very setting.  There weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t any \xe2\u20ac\u0153I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t see that coming!\xe2\u20ac\x9d moments, but there were a lot of \xe2\u20ac\u0153Huh.  Yeah, that makes total sense\xe2\u20ac\x9d moments.  In the end, I think that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d say that <i>Shock:</i> is a contemplative game, and that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a rarity on the market these days.<br/><br/>Thanks, Joshua!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You hang your world on it. Real issues that people really want to address can't be summed up by "Workers' Rights" or whatever. The realities are more subtle, but giving a concrete authority the Ownership of "Workers' Rights" means that you can figure out questions like, "Is it worth joining a union if it jeopardizes my family? Who am I fighting for anyway?" A good Antagonist player can tease those out (though I'm kind of a long way from understanding and canonizing the process, so I'd love to talk about it, but I'm not going to have any straight answers).</p>\n<p>Shock: is really a game about exploring the human condition writ large. Of course, you can't write down all your questions beforehand and expect them not to evolve as you compose an answer.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I do have a counterpoint.

But the way I really suggest is, don't sweat it! You'll express your feelings about a particular question, and along the way, will raise others, less formally.

At the beginning of our last session, I expressed the concern that we weren't actually addressing the Issues on the Grid in play, which seemed like a deviation from the design.  But, since you're saying that this is a feature, not a bug, that's cool.  I'll be sure to relax next time I play.<br/><br/>And I want there to be a "next time".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>See page 44, Ending a Story.
