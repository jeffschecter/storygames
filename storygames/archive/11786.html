Decades being chosen as a convenient way to talk about discrete periods of time, though of course events tend not to fall neatly within them as well as we'd like...<br/><br/>So whats a decade you know something about? Whats the fun and game-worthy stuff in it?<br/><br/>Oh, oh, the 1820s! In the US, you have Andrew Jackson denied the presidency by the House of Representatives 1824, despite winning the popular vote, guiding him to take helm of reshaping the Democratic party and creating a populist legacy that sticks with us to this day. Then he did get elected in 1828. Also, the Eerie Canal was opened. In England, the first public railroad (Stockton &amp; Darlington railway) opened. Also, apparently the first still photograph was taken sometime in this decade. Also, Mexico declared it's independence from Spain, and Greece fought it's war of independence from the Ottomans.<br/><br/>Game ideas: <br/><br/>You play Representatives in the 1824 election, possibly campaigning for the candidates, and then having to make a case for your guy to try and sway the House. Considering that this was an era when politicians still fought duels with pistols, I think this sounds fun.<br/><br/>I'm willing to bet that the opening of the Eerie Canal contained a lot of drama.<br/><br/>I know nothing about it, but I bet something set in the Greek war of independence would be fascinating.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263239/#Comment_263239" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T11:14:06+00:00" title="March 21, 2010 11:14AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a wargame set in the Greek war of independence but I didn't get a chance to buy it.
