Their mission is to satisfy the customers by preparing Roast Unicorn, Salamander Eye Soup, Carnivorous Plant Salads and other bizarre specialities. Of course, anything can get wrong when you're cooking dangerous meals for dangerous creatures.<br/></blockquote>\nAs I am French, the game is written in French. I've tried writing it in English, but I've quickly stopped. I can't find my words when it comes to cooking. And I would never use Google Translate or other automatic translation tools, they're wrong. All the time.<br/><br/>Could anyone give me pointers to a lexicon or a cuisine-related dictionary or help me out in the english translation?<br/><br/><a href="http://brunobord.github.io/monster-chef-rpg/" rel="nofollow">Monster Chef</a> is available <a href="https://github.com/brunobord/monster-chef-rpg" rel="nofollow">on Github, written in Markdown format</a>.
