I was looking at one of these the other day and so I rewrote it again and actually I really like it now! So here it is.]</i><br/><br/><b>Space Mission to Alien Worlds!</b><br/><br/>You are the crew of a spaceship on a mission to patrol the borderlands where interstellar society apparently went to shit centuries ago.* You will help rebuild it! And discover new worlds!<br/><br/>*Or were just sparsely settled by weirdo nutjob cults or something? "Brave new worlds," man, brave new worlds.<br/><br/>There are <b>three sections</b> that spaceship crew can belong to: personnel, security, and technical.<br/><br/>The <b>Personnel Division</b> includes medical staff, physio- and psychological therapists, trainers, dieticians and food services\u2014basically anything that relates to the health and well-being of the crew itself. They have blue uniforms.<br/><br/>The <b>Security Division</b> handles all issues related to the safety and security of the crew and their equipment, from fire safety to environmental exploration to violence and war. They have red uniforms.<br/><br/>The <b>Technical Division</b> maintains and operates all technological devices that the ship and crew possess. They have yellow uniforms.<br/><br/>Or whatever colours of the tokens or chips you have lying around, because you use coloured chips for hold in this game. So maybe on your fleet, technical division is blue, personnel are red, and security is black. Maybe rewrite the colour of the chip so that it says the division instead if you do that, though.<br/><br/><b>Characters have three stats,</b> named after the divisions: personnel, security, and technical. You get a +1 to your division stat, and no automatic bonus to your other two stats.<br/><br/>You write 3 aspects related to one division, 2 aspects related to another division, and 1 aspect related to the third and final division. Which division gets how many aspects is up to you. When you add a certain division stat to your roll, you add +1 to your roll if that is your division, and you add +1 if one or more of that division\u2019s aspects apply to your action. There's no fate points so maybe I should have called these traits instead of aspects, oh well.<br/><br/>If a move lets you ask a question and you take advantage of that info to help your chances when you're making a roll, you get +1. But you can't get more than +1 from any single source: your division stat, aspects, answers, or help.<br/><br/>For example, <b>Engineer Chief Silvanus Lau y Rodriges</b><br/>He gets +1 to technical because that\u2019s his division, and the following aspects:<br/><b>Personnel:</b> Charming and Affable; Medic; Good at Explaining Things.<br/><b>Security:</b> Quick Reflexes.<br/><b>Technical:</b> Starship Engine Designer; Computer Hacker.<br/>Notice he has 3 aspects in personnel, even though he is in the technical division? That is okay! You will be called on to perform your division\u2019s duties more often than not, however, so it\u2019s maybe not a good idea to have only one aspect in your division stat. But go ahead and live dangerously, if you want!<br/><br/>For example, <b>Captain Chanchira Wattana</b><br/>She is security, so she gets +1 to security rolls. But she has the following aspects:<br/><b>Personnel:</b> I Run a Tight Crew; Eye for Weakness.<br/><b>Security:</b> Close Combat Expert.<br/><b>Technical:</b> Sig Geek; Ship-to-Ship Battle Tactics; Survival Technician.<br/>Capt. Wattana is counting on her tech to get her out of a lot of dangerous situations, and if that doesn\u2019t work, well, she has +1 to any rolls regarding danger, and +2 if they involve a fight, so.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436964/#Comment_436964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T00:25:21+00:00" title="August 12, 2014 12:25AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 5:04PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BASIC MOVES<br/><br/><b>There are 5 basic moves:</b><br/><br/><b>When you assess a charged situation,</b> roll+security.

On a 10+, hold 3 blue chips. On a 7-9, hold 2 blue chips.

On a miss, hold 1 red chip but the danger escalates immediately\u2014this might be your last chance, it\u2019s do or die!<br/>While you are tackling this danger, spend a red chip to successfully complete a dangerous action.

On a 7-9, the harm is crippling or disabling in some manner. On a miss, the harm is superficial and may elicit an immediate reaction, but has no long-term effects.<br/>When you suffer harm, roll for the harm based on how dangerous it is.<br/><br/><b>Healing</b><br/>When you recover from harm, roll 2d6 if you are not attended by personnel division, or 3d6 and drop the lowest die if you are. On a 10+, you recover fully and quickly. On a 7-9, you recover fully or quickly, but not both. On a miss, neither.<br/>If you don\u2019t recover fully, but you still survive, write a weakness aspect on your sheet.

He looks around to see if he\u2019s in any danger, which is an assess. He rolls 3+5 and gets no bonus for Quick Reflexes because it\u2019s charged, but not violent. He gets to ask two questions.<br/><b>Lau:</b> What\u2019s my enemy\u2019s true position?<br/><b>MC:</b> You can see these guys are cautious, but not actively hostile. Yet. There\u2019s a couple guards who look like they\u2019re waiting for a signal, but the head guy looks like he\u2019s willing to hear you out here.<br/><b>Lau:</b> Cool. What\u2019s my best way out of here?<br/><b>MC:</b> Okay, so they\u2019re gonna hear you out before they jump you, but you\u2019re also committed. There\u2019s no backing out now. So you better make a deal they\u2019re happy with.<br/><b>Lau:</b> Do they look like rebels? Anti-monarchists? Sorry, I don\u2019t get a third question, I guess.<br/><b>MC:</b> No, that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s pretty obvious. They\u2019re anti-monarchists.<br/><b>Lau:</b> Great! I think I can make a deal here\u2026<br/><br/>Captain Wattana, on the surface of a dangerous tundra planet, flips open her comms unit to give orders to her crew. That\u2019s employing a device\u2014she rolls 3+3 and gets a +1 from her Sig Geek aspect, so she holds 2 yellow chips. She spends 1 to get engineering to scan her surroundings for trouble. Engineering says there is a herd of megafauna coming her way. She spends her last yellow chip to order security to drop riot charges between her and the herd. That should keep them away long enough for her to investigate the crashed shuttle.<br/><br/>While investigating the crashed shuttle, Captain Wattana radios Chief Lau about the best way to safely enter the damaged reactor room and patch the leak. Chief Lau rolls to help her, and gets numbers 6+3 and an additional +1 from Good at Explaining Things. He gets to choose 2 options, so he decides that Captain Wattana gets +1 when she has to tackle the danger of the reactor room, and that she feels reassured by his advice and like he has her back.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back on the ship, Chief Lau is also having a conversation with the black market tech dealer they brought along on this mission. He thinks maybe this dealer knows more about this crashed shuttle than she\u2019s been letting on, so he tries to get a read on her. Unfortunately, he rolls 1+2, so even though he gets a +1 from Charming and Affable, it\u2019s still a miss. He gets to hold 1 blue chip, but the dealer gets to ask 2 questions first.<br/><b>MC:</b> Okay, she wants to know what you\u2019re really feeling. You seemed confident talking to the captain, but how do things really stand with you?<br/><b>Lau:</b> I\u2019m worried, not just about the captain, but also about what happens when we take this experimental reactor core out of the shuttle. I\u2019m suspicious of the dealer\u2014she knows more than she says, she wants more than she says.<br/><b>MC:</b> And how could she get you to let her have the reactor core?<br/><b>Lau:</b> No way! Never. I mean, okay: convince me it\u2019s not dangerous.<br/><b>MC:</b> Okay, that\u2019s two questions, and you still have a blue chip.<br/><b>Lau:</b> I just ask her straight out: "If we bring the reactor out, is it going to be too dangerous for us to handle."<br/><b>MC:</b> She pauses, then says "I know someone who can fix it."<br/><b>Lau:</b> Is she telling the truth? I spend my chip.<br/><b>MC:</b> She hopes she is. She doesn\u2019t know.<br/><b>Lau:</b> Aaargh!<br/><br/>Back on the surface of the tundra planet, Captain Wattana has put on her enviro-suit and is attempting to remove and contain the experimental reactor core. Aside from hoping her suit will withstand the radiation, she has to navigate past twisted scraps of melted metal, remove the reactor, then patch the leak in it. For tackling this danger, she rolls 6+2, but since it\u2019s not a fight, she only gets the +1 from her division bonus, which is still a 9 and she only gets 2 red chips, not 3. She spends 1 chip to set up some ropes and a harness system so she can get in and out safely. Once she\u2019s at the reactor though, the MC says that removing the reactor and patching it will both take 1 chip each\u2014if she takes the time to remove the reactor, she\u2019ll be exposed to the radiation. She decides to patch the leak and tells the ship to get a pickup team from technical division ready to land.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, Captain Wattana had been in a fistfight with a couple of bloodthirsty anti-monarchist terrorists, it would go like this:<br/><br/>The first of the two thugs takes a swing, the second goes for his gun. Captain Wattana charges in. Because she can get the +1 bonus from her Close Combat Expert aspect, a roll of 8 turns into a roll of 10, and she holds 3 red chips. First, she spends 1 red chip to block the blow (otherwise she would have to take the hit), and a second chip to kick his legs out from underneath him and flip him onto his back. So he takes damage based on her being security: a roll of 6+6+1 is 12 after dropping the lowest, so the thug is knocked unconscious.<br/><br/>The second thug is pulling out his gun, but she gets a chance to respond: she spends her third and last red chip to grab his arm and break it. Now that she\u2019s out of red chips, the danger has free reign, but it\u2019s pretty clear that it\u2019s passed: one-arm surrenders and the captain can do what she wants.<br/><br/><b>Okay, that's it!</b> All I got. No spaceship rules or anything else, because man, I dunno, I mostly just wrote this up while I was supposed to be going to sleep, based on some pretty sketchy notes from a long, long time ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437116/#Comment_437116" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T17:23:01+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  5:23PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Back on the surface of the tundra planet, Captain Wattana has put on her enviro-suit and is attempting to remove and contain the experimental reactor core.

There is both twisted metal and radiation making this location dangerous. So if the captain wants to get anything done, she needs 3 chips: 2 to handle both dangers, then 1 to do what she wants.<br/><br/>This can probably lead to all sorts of situations where you get "difficulty 5" dangers and crap like that. On the one hand, this promotes teamwork: you need 3 PCs working together to generate 6 red chips, then they can mop up. It might also lead to situations where a lone PC is fighting a horde of less-competent dudes, and the number of red chips basically determines how many guys he can take out before he has to suffer harm. So it's almost like hit points. And that is kind-of lame, I guess?<br/><br/>Another, probably better, way of looking at it is that you can always overcome fictional obstacles with fictional positioning, but chips allow you to do something automatically. For example, if Captain Wattana was on a spaceship instead of on a planet, she might have been able to turn off the gravity and just float past the twisted pieces of metal. Or, if she had a grav belt, she could roll to use it and spend yellow chips to do the same (in other words, she uses a yellow chip to create a fictional position that allows her to overcome the danger without having to spend a red chip). At that point, she's got red chips AND yellow chips to spend overcoming this danger: red chips represent the character's own physical talents and abilities, while yellow chips represent the strengths and limits of her technology.<br/><br/>I dunno if just using a raygun in a fight is using a technological device or not. Presumably if it's just a thing you fire every once in a while as you do other things, it's not, but if you are hunkered down and blasting away, it would be. I guess if you take power armour into a fight, you would roll for both tackling a danger and using a tech device, and you'd get red and yellow chips to spend on automatic combat actions. But that's the advantage of awesome tech.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437147/#Comment_437147" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T01:26:10+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  1:26AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My star trek fan brain wants to keep turning your Personnel/Security/Technical into the classic star trek division of Command/Science/Operations.  And I think the question with the laser gun is a big part of the reason why.<br/><br/>There's a clear division in the star trek world:  Command is about decisive action.  Science is about knowledge of circumstances.  Operations is about employing skills.<br/><br/>So when Kirk shoots a phaser, it's because Kirk is the hero.  When Worf shoots a phaser, it's because he's employing his military training.  Notably, the transition between the Old trek and New trek involved a reduction in the amount of shooting, especially in the infantry skirmish sense (and ships shooting at ships is more technical, generally, than people shooting at people).<br/><br/>To me, the tackle danger move wants to include both negotiation and not getting shot, while the operate a device move wants to include doing the shooting and repairing the engines.  And the read a person move wants to be able to read more than just people--wants to be able to answer questions about the whole universe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437152/#Comment_437152" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T06:04:29+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  6:04AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2014 6:56AM by Johnstone.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is that what the Star Trek divisions are?

Man, those fucking shirt colours.<br/><br/>That's definitely a point where I'm still a bit fuzzy as to where the line is, and obviously that shows in my examples. I'm leaning towards the idea that you have to use a device for a prolonged period of time in order to roll it, or something like that. You have to actually operate it and not just press a button to make it go. Like, if you just blast a guy with your phaser while you're in a fight, you spend a red chip but don't roll to use a device. But if blasting away with your phaser device is actually how you deal with the danger of the other dude, then you probably would just roll to use the device and not roll to tackle a danger. So I dunno, I don't <i>think</i> I'm opposed to Kirk using the phaser because he is heroic, but I think I'm with you that in most cases (especially ship weapons) it should be an operate device roll.<br/><br/>My original wording was "go into danger" so maybe I should switch back to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437307/#Comment_437307" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T15:20:07+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  3:20PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2014 3:24PM by John_Powell.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't help that Star Trek was never very consistent about uniform colors. Sometimes actors got the color that fit them, rather than the color for their duties. Also Nichelle Nichols probably just looked better in red rather than gold*, so Communications is part of Engineering/Security rather than Operations/Command. <br/><br/>And the chain of command doesn't follow the shirt colors (or make any other kind of sense) at all:<br/><br/>Kirk - gold<br/>Spock -blue<br/>Scotty - red<br/>Uhura - red<br/><br/>WTF?<br/><br/>Anyways, the character definition in your game looks solid to me. My least favorite thing about <i>Apocalypse World</i> is all the different moves. I'd just use one, like <i>World of Dungeons</i>, but that's just me. <br/><br/>*And can you even imagine Leonard Nimoy in red? ugh. Ultimately the colors worked very well on 60's tv, but the later choice to make the uniforms basically black, with the color a highlight was a big improvement in style.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
