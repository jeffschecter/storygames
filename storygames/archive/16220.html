It doesn't take long, and the players may not even know ( other than have a good time with friends), but.... Its no use setting up PvP intrigue if the player just wants to smash orc heads. So with that in mind:<br/>Identify what the <b>player</b> cares about.  <br/><i>'In what sorts of activities do you, the player, want to participate in this game?</i>' Here are some suggestions: Fight? Negotiate? Make things? Escape? Explore? Prove yourself (and to whom)?Be vengeful (and for what cause)? Make discoveries? Get rich? Overcome a weakness? Improve your character\u2019s abilities?<br/><br/><i>'What elements of the game (situation / setting / character) as it currently exists, do you, the player, care about? Why?'</i><br/><br/>Then you have more of an individual guide post to your 'fishing', as you address the character and ask provocative questions. The questions you are after are those questions that really get beneath the skin of the player's. They prompt the story to go somewhere or do something. These questions tend to revolve around personal issues. Ask the questions that come naturally to you. Be comfortable asking simple questions. Don't feel like you need to build every answer into a phenomenal story arc. Just take it one question, one action, and one moment at a time. The main idea being that you present the players with choices, and see who picks what, and what does that say about their characters?<br/><br/>It can be uncomfortable if it's not your normal thing, but the results can really get the players invested in the game through questions. The players do the work, You act as a director. So if you want to frame a scene about a particular issue, ask a <i>character<b></b></i> what it looks like. Everyone at the table will be thinking of it at the same time and you'll all be able to contribute to its expression in play. <br/><br/>If you are 'stuck' you can structure your questions through keywords. There are lists all over the internet. Ask the players to choose one or more that they are interested in and then on a piece of paper write a 'map' with the words in their own boxes or circles or whatever. Then ask questions of the players focusing first with the keyword, then writing the answers down. Dig deeper if you wonder about something.<br/><br/>You'll find the kinds of details you want when your questions ask about or imply bits of the world, or personalities / creatures  / organisations within the setting. If you want them to fill in the world more, that's a fun 'ice-breaker' for the group. Pick a place on the map, and just ask about their experiences there. But you can absolutely bring up any setting element they name drop during 'the conversation' of play and ask about it over and over. Get different players' opinions on the same element. Basically, any time that anyone introduces anything to the fiction and you think \u2018<i>Huh, I wonder what that is about?</i>\u2019 - then ask them out loud!\u2028 Start with general stuff, '<i>How do you do this, where do you find that,</i>' sort of fishing then slide the spectrum towards more personal stuff, when those player character details actually emerge in play. Wait for their characters to react to someone or something, then ask <i>'why did you do that</i>?'\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>If there is no bang apparent, you can start real simple and then chain questions together, in order to manoeuvre a player into an interesting situation. \u2028\u2028A nice variation of this technique is to spit out a detail of your own, but then ask for more from the player. You can frame a bang scene with the answers and ask '<i>What do yo do?</i>' Sometimes, a player can push for a mechanical action in answer to a provocative GM question (like a roll or a conflict) You can then ask a deeper question (revolving around the same issue) of another player character, effectively inviting someone else's vision of the situation into the mix and resultant mechanical resolution.  This is a fantastic way to build relationship maps and otherwise entangle the PCs in the same issues.<br/><br/>Some examples of increasing 'depth':<br/><br/><i>How did you get your (whatever item)?\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>Where do you live? Draw it on the map, here. How do you decorate the place? Where did you get your furniture from? <br/><br/>\u2028\u2028Who do you work for? What do you do to get wealth? \u2028\u2028<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028Which (of the other PCs) would you save, if you could only save one? Why?<br/><br/>Have you two (PCs) ever gotten in a fight? Tell us about it...<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028Who would you turn to in a real emergency?<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028Where do you see yourself in five years?<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028I don't know if you've ever stolen anything but if you had to, who would you steal from?\u2028<br/><br/>Where/Who do you get your sustenance from and where do you eat / drink it? Anybody ever take it from you? Do you know what's in it or where it comes from? Do you <b>want</b> to know what's in it?\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>Who's your favourite NPC organisation? How do you get along with__________ then, when she hates them? What do you do when people want you to switch allegiance?<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028Where do you live? Really? How do you stand the smell / noise / refuse / neighbours? Why do so many people think your neighbours are crazy? Why don't you move into a larger place, there's bound to be one around here somewhere?<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028Are you single or attached? Anybody on the side? Why is that? So last time (name a PC) was hitting on you, what did you do? Did anybody see? So why's (another PC) always giving you that look, or is it something else?<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028Where did you get your clothes / trappings / costume / magical miscellany? Did you find/make them yourself? Are they new or worn out? How many people have tried to kill you for those (magical) shoes of yours? (A NPC) said (a PC) has the exact same outfit as you and therefore you two are in cahoots, what do you think of that?\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>What do you do for fun, usually? Do a lot of people do that or you on your own? What happened the last time somebody tried to stop you, and who was it? You think that'll happen again? What happened when you were doing whatever it is you do for fun that you don't tell anybody about?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/malcolmpdx" title="malcolmpdx"><img alt="malcolmpdx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/malcolmpdx">malcolmpdx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369846/#Comment_369846" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T18:31:22+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  6:31PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure if your game supports it, but if you can easily have an NPC ask things like this in character, that does wonders.

We found out she was the Go\xf0i's wife and that they had an eight year old boy.<br/><br/>For the Go\xf0i, I asked about his dead wife and her children. When he told me they'd had twins, I asked which one was married and had a newborn (making the Go\xf0i, who the player had established as old, a grandfather).<br/><br/>For the Huscarl, I told him he'd been fostered and asked about his sister, also fostered elsewhere.

I say, milk and cookies for the first couple of scenes, get them to make some rolls and save these bombs for when they fail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370376/#Comment_370376" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-01T01:53:59+00:00" title="April  1, 2012  1:53AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the best provocative questions need to be asked in the context of the character, and the campaign. Like, using AW, ask the driver: "Okay, where won't you drive to, no matter what the price? Who was the last person who wanted you to drive something there, and what did you have to do to get them to take no for an answer?" or the Brainer: "Okay, when you Deep Brain Scanned that one warlord, what did you find out? And, uh, what were the circumstances that lead to you Deep Brain Scanning him?" Or even more specific: like, if they give you any details about the character backstory, ask - provocatively, of course - for a little more about that shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
