It continues to be a fascination of a design for me, so I'm really looking forward to this.  Especially in contrast to IaWA and AW, it'll be interesting to play again.  <br/><br/>Every time I read the text of Poison'd though, I hit this complete speed bump about Accursing and this text in particular: "Furthermore you may play dirty tricks with the other cruel fortunes (which, there are some; I leave their discovery to you.)"<br/><br/>I worry a little bit that I don't see the dirty tricks that I might play with other Cruel Fortunes because, for instance, I use them unwittingly.  Perhaps, for instance, Fortunes that don't have a clause to the effect that you should "bring in this Cruel Fortune when" only come in when called for elsewhere?  Becalmment comes to mind, which seems like it would only come into play as a result of an uncorrected Want or Malcontentment.<br/><br/>Or is it rather just intentional layering of Cruel Fortunes by the GM?  Wear &amp; Breakage meets a Ship, for instance.  Malcontentment x3.<br/><br/>I guess, at the root, I find myself uncertain where the principles for Cruel Fortunes lie.  Fairness?  Honesty?  My own amusement?  And while any of those seem reasonable, "play dirty tricks iff Accursing is in play" prods those principles in ways that are ... uncomfortable.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340900/#Comment_340900" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T20:11:37+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  8:11PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent explained some of the dirty tricks once. I can't remember what they are. I never use them.<br/><br/>I find the Cruel Fortunes rather difficult. I use a smattering of the ones that work and which add interesting things into the narrative: for example, I often use Debauchery. Sometimes, I try to drive towards one of the bigger cruel fortunes: Hell, for example.<br/><br/>So, basically, I'm not sure which principles drive the Cruel Fortunes either. Certainly not fairness or honesty. Perhaps your own amusement. More likely, use them to inject interesting things into the narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340936/#Comment_340936" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-30T09:06:49+00:00" title="August 30, 2011  9:06AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use Cruel Fortunes as bangs.<br/><br/>"You're the new captain, congrats.

They're not exactly "interesting decision" fodder.  Not directly.  If anything, they seem to serve as turns on the vice to keep the PCs under pressure.<br/><br/>So I guess that's a principle of use: choose a CF that applies "one turn" of pressure.  If Accursing is in play, spin that handle round.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341150/#Comment_341150" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T22:18:09+00:00" title="August 31, 2011 10:18PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not all of them are, sure. But I found disease to be much more interesting, if each level of fighting against it wasn't just one small maneuver and a roll, but a sequence of dramatic play. In one group, the decision was handed over to the doctor who was also worshipped Satan; the story took a weird turn as the doctor convinced the captain that they should name the sloop Satan's Maiden, paint it black, and get rid of all the Christian symbols onboard. When that didn't work out and the disease spread, they left 30 men behind on an island. I'd say that was an interesting decision.<br/><br/>Similarly, if a Want raises its head, I make it the business of an NPC to say it out loud, and make the situation dramatically interesting to play. And God suggesting a bargain is highly interesting.<br/><br/>Sure, not every CF is good Bang fodder; they don't all serve the same purpose. I couldn't make the Storm interesting to play, for example, but that maybe because I haven't read that many stories about life at sea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
