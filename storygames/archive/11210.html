Basically they were action porn set across a variety of historical settings and featuring the main protagonist Casca Longinus, the Roman soldier who speared Christ's side, cursed to walk the earth until the Second Coming.  Since Casca knows nothing better than war, he spends his years fighting in one army or the other from ancient times to present day.  Sadler wrote something on the order of twenty books in the series before his death in 1989 and another ten have been written posthumously by other authors.  I will confess I haven't read them all and now they're kind of hard to come by.<br/><br/>I was thinking that Casca makes for a pretty good roleplaying character: skilled in combat, at the center of every story in terms of creating action and (best of all for the player) unkillable.<br/><br/>It's that last thing that made me start thinking about roleplaying in this context.  Death is the sticky wicket of roleplaying games.  Nobody likes to have their character die, but when the average character sees as much combat as Casca Longinus does... well, somebody's going to get killed.  The dice don't always fall in favor of the player character.<br/><br/>Some folks really dig the random nature of death in roleplaying games.  The risk involved makes it seem a little more "real," even as the action itself achieves mythic dimensions.  But I'd wager that most players are decidedly <i>not</i> fans of life-or-death dice rolls.  They want to live and live and <i>live</i> regardless of the odds against them.  And, frankly, I don't see anything wrong with that.<br/><br/>I'm going to go on record saying that player characters shouldn't die.  Unless \u2014 and this is an important distinction to make \u2014 death is part of the story.  For example, it would be foolish to have a game featuring a grueling wartime setting and making the characters invincible.  Dying horribly is part and parcel of the war experience and ought to be preserved as an outcome.  But most gaming is heroic-level gaming and dying from a stray bullet or a lucky sword thrust simply isn't part of the story.<br/><br/>One could argue that removing death as a penalty means players will undertake more and riskier actions with their characters, but I ask this: so what?  If players are having fun doing things they'd never dream of doing in real life, isn't that kind of the point of roleplay?  After all, if I want to wear a safety helmet, elbow- and knee-pads and look both ways before crossing the street, I can do that in my everyday life.<br/><br/>In the second Casca novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441295312/thehawfam-20" rel="nofollow">Casca: God of Death</a>, our hero is sacrificed on a Central American altar.  He has his heart <i>carved from his chest and survives</i>.  I don't know about you, but that would make for the mother of all roleplaying war stories.  Why would you want to miss such a thing by enforcing "reality" at every turn?  Not all games can accommodate that level of over-the-topness, but I'd sure like to play in one that does.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249150/#Comment_249150" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T10:29:23+00:00" title="December 30, 2009 10:29AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That character was a key in the short lived series Roar...which IIRC was Heath Ledger's first acting gig.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first Thieves Guild Anthology there was a character who could not die.

Now, my PCs weren't immortal, but they could have effectively been so if they never chose deadly challenges. Which, well, they didn't. Ever.<br/>So - as long as that's not a problem for mood or tone or anything, s'all good.

In fact it's part of two paragraphs of premise at the close of the post:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>One could argue that removing death as a penalty means players will undertake more and riskier actions with their characters, but I ask this: so what?  If players are having fun doing things they'd never dream of doing in real life, isn't that kind of the point of roleplay?  After all, if I want to wear a safety helmet, elbow- and knee-pads and look both ways before crossing the street, I can do that in my everyday life.<br/><br/>In the second Casca novel,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441295312/thehawfam-20" rel="nofollow">Casca: God of Death</a>, our hero is sacrificed on a Central American altar.  He has his heart<i>carved from his chest and survives</i>.  I don't know about you, but that would make for the mother of all roleplaying war stories.  Why would you want to miss such a thing by enforcing "reality" at every turn?  Not all games can accommodate that level of over-the-topness, but I'd sure like to play in one that does.</blockquote>\nMy point, at risk of just repeating of what I've already written, is that the presence of random death as a penalty has a deleterious effect on play.  Removing that as an impediment allows players to take outsized actions that, I postulate, may be the point of roleplay.<br/><br/>I take it from your initial sentence that you aren't a fan of this kind of outsized roleplay, or at least are deeply suspicious of it.  Of course, it my interpretation is incorrect it's because you have me so little to work with.  Better for you to have answered the question you quoted completely so I could see where you were coming from on the issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249434/#Comment_249434" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-03T11:23:12+00:00" title="January  3, 2010 11:23AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My answer to the question remains unchanged:  Maybe.  Sometimes.  Sometimes players having fun doing things they'd never dream of doing in real life is the point of roleplaying, sometimes it isn't.<br/><br/>I guess the way I tend to interpret this sort of approach is "Wouldn't it be awesome if your actions didn't have any consequences?  You could do anything you wanted!"  And, well, tastes vary, and my tastes don't tend to run that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249436/#Comment_249436" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-03T12:14:28+00:00" title="January  3, 2010 12:14PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I'd much care for a game that was anything goes all the time.

In most heroic gaming the idea of ignominious death is out of keeping with the overall tone.  I'm talking about eliminating that as an outcome and focusing instead on doing things without having to worry about being penalized with death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249439/#Comment_249439" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-03T12:48:52+00:00" title="January  3, 2010 12:48PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.
