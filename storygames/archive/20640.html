In an ideal world, how could a game encourage and enable you as a GM/player to gather your friends and keep them coming back week after week?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452951/#Comment_452951" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T17:10:34+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  5:10PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A very good question, that. I am very interested. I am also not having any ideas.<br/><br/>The traditional - one might say fundamental - wisdom here is the D&amp;D trick of making the game into a sort of a mystery cult (no relation to that other thread) where you get to gain "points" and "levels" by committing to the game long-term, and then you get to lord over the other players with your 3rd level character vs. their 1st level ones. That works to hook a certain sort of gamer, as we well know. (Old school D&amp;D also has other, less mechanical developments that reward long-term patience and help stabilize an on-going campaign, as we well know; the xp grind thing is just a particularly mechanically blatant example.)<br/><br/>Along the same lines of blatant bribery, I could see rewarding the GM or other game-operator. Didn't Whitewolf use to give out like titles and special perks for people who organized WoD larps, or am I imagining things? The right sort of person could be motivated by (or rather, their motivation would crystallize with the framework provided by) e.g. a website where you can register your group and boast about your adventures. Like, you could distribute achievements to local groups at a website like it was a video game. In fact, somebody should totally make that a thing, a site that gives out achievements for rpg feats to motivate the OCD crowd  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>In reality, though, I feel that the core truth of the matter is more internal to the activity; you'd need to be able to support people in making their own transformation in their lives, to change it into a life with an active and rewarding culture of play. Perhaps a game could be designed such that it is particularly rewarding and easy to introduce it to new people, or so that it is particularly easy for the game to bring strangers together as new friends? Either effect would make it easier to build the kind of social capital that a successful rpg campaign requires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452955/#Comment_452955" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T17:46:48+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  5:46PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brainstorming:<br/><br/>* Providing space for play might be a really big deal for some.

Games that have only one character, and only one story arc, are much easier to pick up and play. Since such games assume shared character ownership, they can also accommodate a variable number of players more easily, so that everyone doesn't have to show up in order to make satisfying progress.<br/><br/>An episodic, shared-single-character game that can be played by any number of participants would address many of these challenges. If this seems difficult to conceive, just think of any number of literary/mythological/cultural examples: Coyote, Hercules, Nasruddin, Conan, Batman, etc. All characters who eventually became (or started out as) a sort of common property, whose stories collected in aggregate to form a coherent image.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452980/#Comment_452980" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-05T10:10:28+00:00" title="May  5, 2016 10:10AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Given those requirements - and feel free to challenge those - how can we as designers encourage, reward and enable players to coordinate and come together to play? </blockquote>\nMy fundamental doubt is: "Should we?

If you were talking about building a team spirit, then I would absolutely agree, but you shouldn't have to teach someone to organize a session and have people showing up.

As I get further and further into adulthood, punishing people who already busy but need the creative release of gameplay once in a while seems unfair.<br/><br/>This isn't really a mechanical solution, but my groups sometimes will collaboratively write scenes between sessions.  This has the effect of keeping excitement up between episodes, which helps when it's a long time between sessions, and also helps us get into the character headspace a little faster when we do sit down.  It makes us more motivated when the next scheduled game comes up, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453036/#Comment_453036" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T16:21:49+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  4:21PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had success with that, too - and it encourages a very different level of character development!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453043/#Comment_453043" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T21:36:54+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  9:36PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whatever the design can do to make players use social pages to build up expectations for the next session will definitely help a lot. I tried with a FB group to post the campaign material (maps and lore), teasers for the next session (images and short scenes depicting NPCs, places and monsters, music, etc) as well as have players comment about the previous session, filling players who couldn't come on the last events and leaving them space for offtopic. Worked really well.<br/><br/>Also, whatever that can remove one form or another of frustration from the game will be perfect: less character creation time, less GM prep, <br/><br/>Whenever there weren't enough players to start playing the ongoing campaign, we played flashback scenes with the characters of the players present, incorporating newcomers to the improvised adventure as they arrived. This way we kept ourselves entertained in a way that didn't punish those who came later, and also kept the session revolving on the same game.<br/><br/>I'm working on a design that gives players extra dice from a common pool, to which every player present contributes with one dice. The less players present, the less bonus dice you get, which will probably just mean that players already there will call and hurry the rest to get them to come soon, or at least before they have to battle a boss. Despite this, I'm not much of a fan of rewarding player attendance, but of helping the GM tell an engaging story instead and take away any mechanics, procedures or requirements for playing that take away actual gametime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/duneaught" title="duneaught"><img alt="duneaught" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/duneaught">duneaught</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453047/#Comment_453047" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-07T02:45:39+00:00" title="May  7, 2016  2:45AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2016 2:46AM by duneaught.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if there was a game that piggy-backed off of a weekly television series?

We even ran a game of it on S-G a while back. How would you translate that style of input into a story game? <br/><br/>I suppose my ideal Play-by-Post experience would take into account that, yes, while a "turn" happens every 24 hours for example, it still wouldn't require reams and reams of writing on my part. I'd be very happy to drop a text every evening, but I'd not always have time to send 500 words of descriptive content. I suppose I'd want it to be satisfying even with minimal input.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453213/#Comment_453213" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-12T05:38:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2016  5:38AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm. To capture the essence of what makes 24-hour-per-turn Diplomacy work, play between any given pair (or larger grouping) of players must be:<br/><br/>Desirable. Players need a reason to do it, else they won't. In Diplomacy, you want to gather information, arrange favorable joint operations, set up backstabs.<br/><br/>Relevant. It must affect the other players, beyond those present. In Diplomacy, if me'n Jess are planning to invade you from both sides, you care about what me'n Jess are saying to each other in private.<br/><br/>Valid. It can't be dismissed as not real play, or retconned, or wiped out in a merge conflict as multiple streams of side play are sorted out. In Diplomacy, if I promise to help you, I *promised*... if I later go back on that, I've stabbed you in the back. Here it's purely social (or rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act" rel="nofollow">performative</a>) rather than mechanical, but still real.<br/><br/>Independent. It can't be blocked by the need for input from absentees. In Diplomacy, this is handled through the web service that actually runs the game.<br/><br/>Possible. Any given pair of players should be able to play. Not "Any given pair including Jess", or "Jess and Tom or Sally and Bill, but not Tom and Bill or Jess and Sally." In Diplomacy, it's always possible to try to strike up a secret alliance with someone, or bamboozle them into leaking a bit of intel, or run a false flag against them.<br/><br/>Optional. Not everyone always has time for side play. In Diplomacy, I can always just fill out my orders without talking to anyone else. I'll probably get screwed, but it's an option.<br/><br/>How to make a story game or RPG do that? Gotta think on it more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453234/#Comment_453234" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-12T17:03:45+00:00" title="May 12, 2016  5:03PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really interesting analysis, Jeph!<br/><br/>I did some thinking about this myself a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13435/diplomacy-inspired-design-in-a-story-game-medium" rel="nofollow">while back</a>, although it didn't get too far in terms of design.<br/><br/>Most games which have interesting dynamics - like Diplomacy, Mafia, the Resistance, and so forth - are, in my opinion too tightly designed to work for RP/story-gaming. The game itself takes over and pushes the roleplay out to the edges. But I still have a dream of building something functional by harnessing the power of some of those game and social dynamics for a story game.

I think part of it is that there's no cost to pulling a fade-out, since these aren't your real friends you're letting down, just some strangers on the net. And part of it is the high commitment required, reading and writing so much text so regularly.

The game I play in and the game I run have deliberately kept things more simple (d6 damage all around, mostly no multiple attacks) and simple initiative (all pcs go all monsters go, or visa versa). The GMs will autopilot combat as much as possible. I will often run several rounds of combat before hitting something that really warrants a response. Once i went too far and we had to re-wind. The games are slow, but the investment to play is minor. Sometimes it's frustrating that nothing really happens for a week or two, but then people get back in sync and a flurry of activity moves things along.<br/><br/>In the game I play in, one of the groups is slowly overthrowing the world order. One of the PCs on gaining a dancing sword years ago started rumors that the wielder of the dancing sword was the true king, he is now bringing that plan to fruition (after having been idle for a bit of time - see the medium even supports players dropping out and then re-entering the game).<br/><br/>Another trick I use is that if a PC dies, I immediately roll up a new PC (the game I play in and my game both have the GM make all the die rolls including character generation). If the player ends up dropping out, it's no big loss.<br/><br/>Now sure, we could design a game that would be more specifically tailored to play by post, and there is certainly a point to games with a defined duration, but I'm personally more interested in how to have these compelling long running games be a more repeatable thing.<br/><br/>Frank<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
