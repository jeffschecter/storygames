<p>Okay, here's the thing.  Suppose you have three players (Eric, Sydney and Tony).  They've got index cards.  Tony is in the role of the "Storyteller" so he has contributed index cards with story elements like "The Faerie Court" and "Kidnapped children."  Eric is playing nebbishy occult-geek Ben, and has contributed index cards with character traits like "Ben's Soul" and "Nice Guy" and "Driver's license."  Sydney is playing Rachel, creepy Goth-chick, and has contributed index cards with character traits like "Arrogance" and "Creepy."</p>
<p>Ben and the Faerie King are dancing around the edge of maybe making a deal.  This is the part where a standard CR game says "Okay, Eric you declare what you want on the one side, Tony you declare what you want on the other side, then we'll roll."  That's not how Misery Bubblegum works.</p>
<p>Instead, we're going to say like this:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Eric: I want a to make a choice about whether I'll rescue the kidnapped children.  The children are on one side.  Roll, roll ... done!<br/>
  Tony:  You know what the Faerie King wants.  Ben's Soul is on the other side.  Roll, roll ... it's in!<br/>
  Sydney:  If Ben gives up his Soul then Rachel won't be the creepiest person on the block.  She'd be, like, creepy-wannabe.  So her Creepy is on the side with Ben's Soul.  Roll, roll ... dang it.  Tony beat me.<br/>
  Tony:  I don't want to be greedy.  Just Ben's Soul is fine.  Isn't that a fair price?<br/>
  Eric:  Okay, we done rolling and adding things?  Okay.  I choose the children.  I get control of that card, Tony you get control of Ben's Soul.<br/>
  Tony:  Come to me, my precious card ... I have such plans!</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And yeah, there's this whole rule system already partly constructed in my head, but honestly I don't want to get into all of it.  I've already been discussing it over on the Indie Games forum on the Forge, you can do detail work there if you want (heck, I'll thank you profusely!)</p>
<p>What I want in this rough and tumble forum is I want people to help me figure out <em>what makes cool Stakes.</em>  How can I make a system that will let the players create good stakes by each pursuing their own selfish agendas?  How, in short, do we abstract the skill of balancing stakes so that a system can guide people who don't have that skill to it?</p>

                            a) The stuff on the cards needs to be stuff that the players care about.  While I can see Driver's License being important in a coming-of-age game with modern rites of passage and blah-de-blah-blah, I'm not seeing how it's significant in the context of a plot with a faerie king and all that.  So how do you regulate what's on the table to be used in the first place?<br/><br/>b) A corrolary to (a) -- how do you remove things once they're no longer useful?<br/><br/>c) Would it be possible for players to stake resources on the stuff that they put into a conflict, and if that side gets picked, they earn a return on that investment?  So I put forward "Amanda's Love" and stake three resources on it.  If he takes that side of the conflict, I get six resources back.  If he takes the other side, I lose those three resources (maybe when you choose one side, you take the resources on the opposite side, or use the resources on the opposite side to pay the returns for the chosen side?)                        </div>

<p>(a) The problem is that it's even worse than that.  If <em>Eric</em> cares deeply about Ben's driver's license, and offers it up as a worthy trade for the kidnapped children, <em>Tony</em> is still allowed to think that's lame.  People don't engage over the card until they <em>both</em> see some value in it (even if the value is primarily "I can really tie Eric up in knots if I control this card")</p>
<p>(b) Yeah.  Dunno.  Maybe there's a pay-off that you can get (dependent on how big a deal the card has been in the past) for destroying a card?  Or maybe the cards are always <em>potentially</em> there, but at the beginning of each session players have to "kit out" by choosing the five that they will play in this particular session.</p>
<p>(c) Oooooooh.... I do like betting schemes.</p>

"Do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend?  Yeah?  Do you have parents?  Which would you trade to save the other's life?  Okay, put that one on a card."                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Well, the thing that pops out at me is, number of cards. The less cards you start with the more valuable each card becomes. If you have 3 cards, putting one up for grabs is a big deal, no? Conversely, if you have 10 cards, putting one on the block is not a deal breaker. It seems counterintuitive, the more cards you have the easier it is to set stakes. While advanced players would prefer to have less cards with more at stake in each interaction... But I imagine that is how it really works.<br/>

                            I like Joshua's idea of betting.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an idea that popped into my head.<br/>
<br/>
Tony: I have 3 dice that says "Ben's Soul" (which is currently controlled by Eric) is part of this side of the stakes, and it will go to the "Fairy King".<br/>
Sydney: Yeah, I have 1 dice that agrees with Tony.<br/>
<br/>
Eric: Well, I have 3 dice against, lets roll.<br/>
Or<br/>
Eric: OK, you convinced me, here is "Ben's Soul", I'll take those 4 dice.                        </div>

<p>Shawn:  Does that make it really detrimental to be the first one offering dice?  Like, if Eric had offered two dice in the first place, would he then be able to take those dice back by giving?  Or would his two dice be lost?</p>

                            The controller of the story element goes last, so he can make the decision to roll or take the dice. If the controller offers (goes first) to put the story element into the stakes, then he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take the dice as a bribe.<br/>

                            My last post was rushed. This should be more understandable.<br/>
<br/>
In this idea, all the story elements (things on the 3x5 cards) are controlled by someone [the controller]<br/>
<br/>
During stake settings, we go around the table, with each participant is given a chance to suggest a story element [SE] for one side of the stakes, who becomes that SEs new controller if that side of the stakes are picked, and the number of dice he is committing to make this happen.<br/>
<br/>
After a SE is suggested, each participant gets a chance to commit dice to accepting or rejecting the suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
If the suggester is a different person than the controller of the SE, then the controller gets to go last on the dice commitment.<br/>
<br/>
If the controller is neither the suggester nor the GM (nor the storyteller?), then he has the option of just taking the dice the participants who were for accepting the suggestion and the SE goes to the suggested side of the stakes. Participants who were on the rejecting side get their dice back.<br/>
<br/>
If the suggestion goes to dice rolling, the side with the highest total wins, and all dice rolled go back into the bowls.<br/>
<br/>
Once a suggestion has been rejected, then it can not be suggested again in this conflict. The SE can be suggested for the other side of the stakes.<br/>
<br/>
The SEs on the side of the stakes that the GM does not pick, go back to their controllers.                        </div>
