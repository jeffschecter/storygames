Some time ago, the idea of running the classic "Keep on the Borderlands" module under Dungeon World hit me as...well, a "good" idea might be too strong; let's go with "interesting."<br/><br/>What I'm interested in is seeing how one of the hoariest of the the Old School modules plays under a story game that is designed to emulate Old School experiences. (Among other things; I'm not trying to limit the scope of Dungeon World here.)<br/><br/>So, I sat down with the conversion notes and a print out of the module to see what I could come up with.<br/><br/>The conversion notes in DW are interesting, and I'm glad I read them--I'd have just converted the module straight-up, bringing in the monsters in the numbers &amp; varieties listed. Instead, the notes advise taking a more liberal approach--converting interesting traps, looking for custom moves, and maybe sussing out the fronts that exist in the module.<br/><br/>There aren't a lot of interesting traps in the module, but I did find a few places for custom moves, which I'll talk about when the players unlock them. I decided to hold off for a while on the fronts, to see what developed, but I did decide to work out the politics of the Caves of Chaos, which led to the elemental backstory I developed. Under the principle of <i>draw maps, leave blank spaces</i>, I made this as sketchy as possible:<br/><br/>Twenty-five years ago, the Princess Cinna was kidnapped from a city-state on the Imperial fringe. Her mother the Empress delivered an ultimatum to that city and then destroyed it. Fearing the Empire was going to turn on all the states on its border and destroy them one-by-one, the small states banded together in a league and began raising armies; lacking manpower, they turned to humanoids. Eventually an overlord--the Evil Overlord, as many call him, although his name was Eirik--arose to prosecute the war. The tide finally turned the Empire's way after the battle of Forthingar Firth, where the Overlord's navy was burned, and the war ended 11 years ago. Recently the Empress Victoria has opened the war-ravaged Borderlands to settlement.<br/><br/>The humanoids living in the Caves of Chaos are mostly refugees from the armies of the Evil Overlord.<br/><br/>So, vaguely Roman-meets-feudal society. I worked out names &amp; leaders for each of the tribes, and a basic history of why they were in the Caves.<br/><br/>As this game was going to be the "B" game at my Tuesday meetup--meaning I'd not always know who would be in it--I decided to steal an idea from Ben Robbins and have a fictional map that is carved into a table in a tavern in the Keep. This map would be a physical item--I'd draw it as they adventured through it--and that way new members would have a record of what happened previously. (I dithered about whether I should have the players draw the map, but decided that I really didn't want to spend the precious time I had calling out room dimensions.)<br/><br/><i>Next time: the first foray into the Caves of Chaos!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433584/#Comment_433584" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-09T09:37:31+00:00" title="June  9, 2014  9:37AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting... will be reading along!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meadmaker" title="Meadmaker"><img alt="Meadmaker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://hhttps://www.me.com/ro/dleted/Galleries/100010/skully/web.jpg?ver=12960753700006"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meadmaker">Meadmaker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433593/#Comment_433593" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-09T11:49:55+00:00" title="June  9, 2014 11:49AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure if you have ever seen this one.

We don't know yet if it was the Imperials or the humanoids who did the scattering.<br/><br/>The only notable bonds that came in play were between Trixie and Ember: Trixie had stolen from Ember, and Ember knew Trixie was keeping a secret from him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433660/#Comment_433660" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-10T07:34:14+00:00" title="June 10, 2014  7:34AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we began the first session! Hallek informed me that he had been at the Keep for a while, waiting for the rest to catch up to him; I let him know that he had been on patrols with the Keep garrison and so knew the area reasonably well at this point. I also began setting the hook for the Caves of Chaos--loaded with humanoids, and treasure!<br/><br/>Hallek, in response to my question, told me that the Keep was old but well-maintained. As they entered the Keep, the anniversary of the Battle of Forthingar Firth was being celebrated--low-key, but everyone in the Keep was at the inn.<br/><br/>The innkeeper, Sage, told the PCs about how when her grandmother was running an inn in another part of the Empire, adventurers used to map their discoveries on one of the tables, and everyone agreed this was a great idea and promised to do the same.<br/><br/>They set out for the Caves of Chaos, following the road and then cutting through the woods. This triggered <b>Take a Perilous Journey</b>, and everyone landed in the 7-9 range. So that night, Ember noticed some twinkling lights off in the woods. Waking Xar, she went to find out what was happening.<br/><br/>They found a circle of stones in the moonlight. Fairy lights twinkled around them. As they watched, a woman with a bronze knife surprised them. She was unhappy to see someone clad in steel, but cautiously friendly. Ember, after <b>Spouting Some Lore</b> about the fairy circle, recognized her as one of the First People who lived in the region long ago. When the strange woman informed them that "time was, I'd tell fortunes if people would give me mead," they brought her back to camp.<br/><br/>Her name was Seithkona, and she told them that there were indeed humanoids of all kinds in the caves, and they sometimes hunted at night. As for her, she was celebrating the rites of the moon. She also recognized Galfar as a wanderer and that Xar had lost his faith.<br/><br/>While the others talked, Trixie snuck away to the stone circle and walked into it. She had a vision of herself picking up a large golden chalice, encrusted with gems. As she watched the vision, she saw herself be stabbed from behind with a sword.<br/><br/>At some point in the night, Seithkona vanished again.<br/><br/><i>[Yes, fine, I've been reading Sagas of the Icelanders. I did my best (=bad) northern Irish accent for Seithkona. I also let Ember know that this would definitely be a "Place of Power" for rituals.]</i><br/><br/>The next day they arrived at the Caves. This was a steep-sided ravine, dotted with trees and ominous black cave openings. Hallek looked around for some tracks, and found two trails--one heavily traveled, and the other much fainter. They decided to follow the lighter trail up the slope to the opening of a cave. Heads of humans and other humanoids were nailed to the rock wall around the opening.<br/><br/>Sir Xar examined the trail. With his veteran's eye, he suddenly realized that this trail was lighter not necessarily because there were fewer people using it, but because they had been very carefully attempting to obscure their numbers.<br/><br/>Ember tried to summon some light to the end of his staff, but for some reason the magical energies wouldn't knit.<br/><br/><i>[6- on the <b>Cast a Spell</b> move; I decided to "think offscreen", but I made a slight error--I should have allowed the spell to work anyway, as this would have given Ember some idea that Bad Things were developing.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433661/#Comment_433661" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-10T07:55:24+00:00" title="June 10, 2014  7:55AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2014 7:56AM by Aviatrix.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They entered the cave and soon came to a T-shaped intersection. Cautiously looking around the corner, they could see that the right hand branch ended in a room. They discussed what to do for a while until Galfar, hung-over from the late night mead-drinking session, decided to charge into the room.<br/><br/>As he came through the door, a rope was suddenly jerked off the floor and held at knee height. He tumbled into the room and bounced up. Two orcs were on either side of the doorway, holding a rope; next to each of them was another orc, with shield and spear at the ready. And in the corner was an enormous orc holding a gigantic battle axe.<br/><br/><i>[So, Ember's failure--I decided the very clever head of this tribe had a "Detect magical energy" trap running; thus the orcs were on the alert. Crossing the rope was <b>Defy Danger (Dex)</b>.]</i><br/><br/>Galfar begins to shout his challenge, but the orcs throw a spear into him to shut him up. <br/><br/><i>[6- on the Barbarian <b>Challenge</b> move, so I dealt damage.]</i><br/><br/>Xar charges in, leaping nimbly over the rope but skidding to a halt in front of the huge orc, who swings his axe down with great force. Xar raises his shield, but the axe shatters it.<br/><br/><i>[Decided this was <b>Defend</b>, and Xar got a miss; the obvious move was the orc Breaker's break stuff move.]</i><br/><br/>Trixie does a neat roll over the rope, slicing it with her rapier as she does. Galfar brains one of the orcs with his sword, killing him. Trixie stabs another with her poisoned rapier.<br/><br/>Xar smashes the Breaker but the enormous orc laughs it off. As he raises his axe again, Hallek ducks around the entrance and fires an arrow into his head, stunning him.<br/><br/><i>[Nice use of <b>Called Shot</b>.]</i><br/><br/>Xar wheels his sword around, but at the last moment the Breaker comes to and blocks most of the attack.<br/><br/><i>[Rolled a 1 for damage, so this was the narration. Wasn't hack n slash, just damage dealing since the Breaker was stunned.]</i><br/><br/>Hallek fires another arrow into the Breaker's arm as he raises his battle axe. The axe tumbles to the ground, but since it is on a long tether the orc begins to pull it back up. Trixie rushes in to strike his unprotected back--but too late! The Breaker grabs his axe and smashes the rapier, breaking it off at the hilt.<br/><br/><i>[A miss on the <b>Sneak Attack</b> move. Technically the Breaker breaks armor, but this seemed too good to not use.]</i><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ember notices that several orcs have blocked off the rest of the hallway he is standing in with tower shields. An arrow strikes him, but despite his dithering he throws a magic missile at the Breaker.<br/><br/>Xar strikes the Breaker again, then ducks inside his reach to strike again. Enraged, the Breaker smashes his breastplate, caving half of it in.<br/><br/><i>[7-9 on <b>Hack and Slash</b> so I offered an opportunity: do your damage again, provided you let the breaker hit your armor. Xar went for it.]</i><br/><br/>Galfar slays another orc, and Ember fires another magic missile at the Breaker as he ducks into the room. Simultaneously, the Breaker throws his battle axe. Ember staggers back as the axe nearly brains him, but the Breaker falls to the ground dead. The last orc scampers out of the room.<br/><br/>Outside, a female orc calls out: "We have more food than you. Perhaps we should talk about this." Trixie desperately looks around for a secret exit, but only discovers that there's a trapdoor in the ceiling; orcs open it up and glare in at them.<br/><br/>Ember and Xar step into the hallway, Xar carrying an orcish shield to replace his broken one. The chieftainess steps through her shield wall. "You have not earned the right to carry that," she tells Xar. Seeing a chance, Ember urges Xar to go through the orcish Initiation rites.<br/><br/>Soon all are gathered in a banquet hall. Xar is given a potion to drink and a pipe to smoke. Soon he is disoriented--and blind. The Chieftainess takes a long spear and strikes at Xar, tripping him up and finally knocking him to the floor. "Say goodbye to your gods," she says.<br/><br/>"I have lost my faith!" says Xar.<br/><br/>Taken aback, the orc leader pauses, and then stabs her spear down once, twice, three times, cutting Xar on either cheek and his forehead. "Today is not your day to die, human. Live with your loss of faith, as I do."<br/><br/>Negotiations begin. The Chieftainess of the Blood Eyes--"Cohort B, Third Legion," as she introduces them--demands weregild. Trixie gives them an amulet she had stolen from Ember. ("Hey!" says the angered mage.) After that, they are allowed to return to the Keep, wiser if not richer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433664/#Comment_433664" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-10T08:50:38+00:00" title="June 10, 2014  8:50AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool.

Joining them this time are two elves Frederick, a fighter, and A, a druid. Sir Xar is in the middle of a vigil and unavailable.<br/><br/>Trixie goes looking for a new rapier but is dismayed to discover it costs 25 gold coins--far more than her poor stock.<br/><br/>Hallek drops in on the Captain of the watch, who is talking to a grizzled adventurer. Hallek notices that his hair is singed and an arm is in a sling. "Kobolds," explains the wounded man. "Lots of them. We ran into their traps. But they have some kind of huge golden idol, would have been worth a lot."<br/><br/>Hallek brings this news to the rest. Ember informs the others that kobolds are small, scaly, vaguely dog-headed humanoids. They believe themselves to be related to dragons, hate stand-up fights, and generally have many nasty traps in their lairs.<br/><br/>They set out through the woods to the Caves. Thanks to Halleks skilled trailblazing, they arrive in the late afternoon.<br/><br/><i>[Finally, a 10+ on the Undertake a Perilous Journey move.]</i><br/><br/>They head to the cave, marked "A" on their map, that is known to be the lair of the kobolds. A tree has grown over the roof of the cave, but after brushing aside the branches, they can see down a tunnel that ends in a T shaped intersection. Trixie scouts ahead, and discovers that there is a pit trap just inside the entrance. Unfortunately, she discovers this while she is standing on the precisely balanced pit cover.<br/><br/><i>[7-9 on her trapfinding, so I "put her on the spot."]</i><br/><br/>Hallek loops a rope and throws it at Trixie, who has meanwhile noticed several pairs of glinting red eyes just inside the intersection. As Hallek pulls Trixie back, blowgun darts smack into the wall. Ember fashions a ball of pure darkness, and A, who has transformed into an owl, flies over the kobolds and drops it on them. They run forward, but Galfar shouts his challenge. One immediately cowers in the corner, and Galfar and Frederick quickly dispatch the other two.<br/><br/><i>[Custom move to retrieve Trixie that I made up on the spot; 7-9 would have been, You need help pulling her out, and a miss would have had both of them going into the pit. Ember switched to the Mage playbook, and this was her first Black Magic.]</i><br/><br/>The cowering kobold is surrounded. "You're going to help us," hisses Ember ominously.<br/><br/>"All right, just promise not to hurt my family! We're the Notch Ears."<br/><br/>"Fine. What's up that way?"<br/><br/>"Make a left, then another left, and you'll get to our midden. Go straight, make another left, that's food storage. Make a right, you get to the common room; go straight and make a right, that's where my family live. Of course, you have to get through the Corridor of Pain."<br/><br/>They decide to check out the midden. Hallek notices that the garbage of more than just kobolds seem to be dumped here, and also some very large rats. He asks the kobold, whose name is Bent Leg.<br/><br/>"Our people once owned all these caves, until the others started showing, those goblins across the way and the orcs. But one day we will Raise the Dragon and take back our lands."<br/><br/>Trixie discovers a fine necklace in the garbage easily worth 150 coins, and the others find some gems scattered about. They decide to head to the food storage room next. Along the way Bent Leg happens to mention that his family's quarters have retainers in the outer room.<br/><br/>"Wait. Is your mother the queen?" asks Ember.<br/><br/>"Yes, of course."<br/><br/>The food storage room is not particularly interesting at first glance. The party pushes their way into the room to examine it more closely. As they do, Bent Leg casually takes a few steps back, and then breaks for the doorway. A transforms quickly into a wolf, but merely manages to crash into the door as Bent Leg dashes out of the room. There is the sound of a lock turning, and a heavy bar dropping.<br/><br/>Then the ceiling begins to move towards the floor.<br/><br/><i>[6- on A's transform roll. Bent Leg took the opportunity of getting everyone in one of the few rooms with a door to make his break.]</i><br/><br/>Frederick tries to force the door, but it is too heavy. Galfar bellows, and then plants a might kick into the center of the door. It splinters and flies back, revealing a corridor choked with pole arm carrying kobolds.<br/><br/><i>[Frederick failed his Bend Bars, Lift Gates roll but Galfar used his destruction move.]</i><br/><br/>A confused melee breaks out. Frederick dashes at the kobolds, scattering them, but they close in behind him. Hallek begins firing arrows at the Queen's bodyguard. Galfar charges the bodyguard, slaying several, but his momentum carries him past everyone.<br/><br/>Small panels unlatch along the walls, and suddenly fire fills the area the adventurers are in.<br/><br/>Ember calls upon the powers of darkness to transform into a huge, menacing shadow. He infects the other shadows in the hallway. Most of the kobolds break and run into the common room. Ember, flitting from shadow to shadow, follows them.<br/><br/><i>[A couple of PCs got set on fire, but Ember's stunt allowed them to escape that danger pretty quickly. This is of course a downside of having the Mage in play--a creative player can come up with some drastically nasty magic. We were getting close to wrapping up, however, and the kobolds aren't really that tough; also, after last week's surprise, I was rooting for the players to have a successful expedition.</i><br/><br/>In the common room is an enormous golden idol, roughly dragon shaped. The kobolds are bowing down and supplicating the idol.<br/><br/>Ember looms up hugely in the shadows, which vaguely resemble a dragon now. "I will aid you, but I need sacrifice. Go and throw yourself into the fire."<br/><br/>Many of the kobolds run away in a frenzy of religious destruction. A transforms into a bear, hugs the idol, and helps lug it outside. Hallek fashions a sledge, and they set out on the return journey to the Keep.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437572/#Comment_437572" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-20T19:07:43+00:00" title="August 20, 2014  7:07PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So this got buried behind life. Funny old thing. But let me try to catch up on the plot, and some observations about the overall project:<br/><br/>Over several forays into the Caves, the PCs gradually came to understand the relationships between the tribes. The Blood Eyes, aka the Third Legion--the orcs who thrashed them in the first session--are some of the last remnants of one of the Evil Overlord's legions, and maintain military discipline under their leader, Bargash. The Crushers, their neighboring tribe, are a more "traditional" orc tribe.<br/><br/>The Kobolds of course were <i>nearly</i> wiped out.<br/><br/>The Goblins, across the clearing from the orcs, were deserters from the Evil Overlord's army; they had killed their leaders and proclaimed themselves an autonomous collective. (I have a lot of fun with my Communist goblins.) They were preyed upon by the Hobgoblins. The backbone of the Evil Overlord's armies, the hobs were still top dog in the caves.<br/><br/>Until Galfar and company, that is. They butchered several in their first attempt on the hob caves; although they didn't get very far, they did a lot of damage. Trixie the halfling found some prisoners in their caves, and rescued them: Jariid the Blood Eye orc (giving them a contact in the Blood Eyes), a merchant and his wife who gave Trixie a magic dagger as a reward, and two men-at-arms, Garth and Alice, who swore to be spear-carriers for a year and a day to the PCs.<br/><br/>Bent Leg the kobold told them about a few other locations: a "haunted" cave that used to be kobold worship grounds, the bugbears who were still working as secret police for the hobgoblins (they'd had a similar function for the Evil Overlord), a minotaur General living next door to them, and finally an evil cult in the uppermost caves.<br/><br/>After their first foray into the hob caves, they encountered a strong hob patrol in the woods. Galfar utterly slew most of them, breaking hobgoblin power; other adventurers sacked the caves, and the goblins hung the few survivors for "crimes against the revolution." The few hobs who escaped, however, went off in search of their relatives to raise an army of vengeance.<br/><br/>In the meantime the PCs sacked the "haunted" cave, killing a bugbear and encountering a water weird that dragged their new friend, Pius the cleric, into Faery. He was forced to promise the Fae woman he met there three favors; given that the player had to drop out, I guess one of them was the usual "spend a century with me" :-)<br/><br/>Around this time I began to get bored with the dungeon crawl aspects, as you may have noticed. So I had two sessions that worked as changeups and got my juices flowing again.<br/><br/>The first was a session that took place almost entirely at the Keep. Trixie was ambushed by some bugbears sent to assassinate her, but thanks to her magic dagger and the assistance of the party, she survived. (For the magic dagger, I have her roll +Cha. 7-9 hold 1, 10+ hold 3. She can use her hold to do "magic weapon" stuff, like automatically hitting, having it fly back to her hands after throwing it, etc.)<br/><br/>The next session, Lady Belladonna, the ruler of the Keep, sent the PCs on a mission to convince the lizardmen to join the Keep's forces. The hobgoblins and orcs from both the Crushers and Blood Eyes also sent emissaries, but the surprising diplomacy of Galfar helped win the day for the Keep. During this session Galfar killed the extremely tough leader of the Crushers in single combat, although he nearly died; Death's Black Gate opened, but he resisted the call. To everyone's surprise, the Crushers explained that he was now Burkanog, or leader of their tribe. He soon discovered this position came with a trio of wives--one young, one middle-aged, one old--who in fact do most of the work of managing the tribe, ceremonially marrying whoever the male chieftain is.<br/><br/>They managed to find the General. I had written a custom move ("when you wander in the Minotaur's maze") but the bard (Daltrey Page; Hallek's player decided she really liked playing bards better) managed to easily unweave the enchantment. This let them meet and impress the minotaur. From there they slew the bugbear chieftain and his two elementalist slaves.<br/><br/>At this point the rest of the Third Legion showed up, eager to fight the humans in the Keep. Galfar and company managed to convince them to call a formal council of war, hoping that the Keep could promise them a place to live in safety in exchange for fighting the hobgoblin army. Lady Belladonna agreed to come to the council of war, but only if the PCs could buy her some time--perhaps they could disable the hobgoblin siege engines? The goblins, who could easily pass as members of the hobgoblin auxilliaries, agreed to help sabotage the siege engines--but only if they got a seat at the war council. And the General, who could sway the the rest of the Third Legion, agreed to come--but only if a formal council of war was held.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437573/#Comment_437573" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-20T19:24:32+00:00" title="August 20, 2014  7:24PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Galfar and company--this now mainly Galfar, Trixie, a ranger named Shrike, and a thief named Dodge--managed to infiltrate the hobgoblin army...messily. Galfar decided that his role was to create a distraction, and so he led the hob patrols deeper into the woods while Shrike, Dodge, and a wizard named Holwyr snuck towards the siege engines.<br/><br/>These proved to be pulled by some large but stupid hill giants. Their goblins--led by commissar Borya--claimed to be part of a work crew, and got to work on the engines. This went swimmingly until a hobgoblin sergeant arrived and demanded papers. Shrike, Holwyr, and Dodge sprang into action. Shrike used called shots to harrass the giants, Dodge did the old "try and hit me!" maneuver to get the giants to smash their own engines, and Holwyr discovered that it's not easy being a "magic man" around giants.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Galfar killed most of his pursuers but ran into a cultist! The evil priest summoned down a nightwing, but the barbarian made quick work of it. Despite the ring of fire he summoned up, the priest was no match for the barbarian. Although, as he died, Galfar felt a grim forboding. I wrote down "the dark magic of Galfar" in my notes, planning to use it for next session.<br/><br/>Next session (last session!) saw the council of war. Together Galfar and Bargash managed to convince the assembly to fight for the humans--in this they were helped greatly by capturing one of the Keep's chaplains.<br/><br/>It turns out that the Keep had originally been built by the hobgoblins as a fortress for the Khaotian cult; a close examination of the enormous statue showing the Imperial Patron Goddess Solaria crushing the evil goddess Favilla Chaus underfoot showed that in fact the heads of the statues had been reversed! Trixie made a brief foray into the treasury of the church and discovered they had preserved an evil resurrection caldron and disguised it as a baptismal font.<br/><br/>(I should mention that as a reward for their mission to the lizardmen, they had received some magic items from the keep; the notable ones were a helmet Galfar took that allows him to sense where his scattered tribesmen are, and a magic harp for Daltrey that we have not had a chance to find out about yet.)<br/><br/>The chaplain did the usual "you think you can win?" bit, and as he spoke the sky began to darken--the cult was bringing an unnatural darkness upon the world. The group made a foray into their caves, avoiding some undead and discovering a medusa who had been imprisoned by them; fortunately, they've stayed on her good side so far, so there's no extra statuary anywhere.<br/><br/><br/>So, how has this mix of old and new played out?<br/><br/>Like I said, I got bored of the pure dungeon crawl after a while. Luckily, DW had tools to break me out of the rut, and for an improvisational GM like myself they can be pretty powerful (although I do sometimes have trouble deciding on what move to make, especially for Defy Danger partials.) Opening the game up with two non-caves sessions helped greatly.<br/><br/>The politics of the Caves was something I planned from the start, although I never thought that it would end with one PC being the chieftain of an orc tribe. But what the hell; this is turning out to be a great story.<br/><br/>I've been using the published module as a guide to my improvisation; usually I base my description on what is in the book, although I rarely hew closely to it. (For example, the two elementalist bugbears was completely off the wall.)<br/><br/>All in all...I don't know. It's an uneasy mix, I think, the prepublished sandbox and a game built around not knowing a lot about what happens next. I'm not sure it's an experiment I'd like to repeat, or at least not as the focus of an entire campaign--I think it would be much more fun to just open the world up and see what happens. But I <i>do</i> think that the story we've gotten so far could <i>not</i> have come so easily with a more trad setup. Maybe; I suppose I'd have to try it OSR sometime to find out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000" title="johnthedm7000"><img alt="johnthedm7000" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000">johnthedm7000</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437683/#Comment_437683" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-24T21:32:34+00:00" title="August 24, 2014  9:32PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a lover of all things AW engine and as someone currently running a very Old-School open table Dungeon Crawl Classics game I can tell you that there's not as big a gulf between old-school sandbox play and newer more explicitly narrative designs. The difference is (at least in my experience) that in old-school dungeon/hexcrawl play the interesting stories are generated based on players interactions with prepped material, combined with the results of interpreting copious amounts of randomly generated content (random encounters, random treasure, etc).<br/><br/> Dungeon World definitely relies on prep (Fronts and such) but it's more "broad strokes" prep and less "There are 30 goblins in these caves, they have xyz stats, here's how often they have patrols", but eschews random tables and such in favor of GM improvisation based on the results of player rolls and the application of hard/soft moves. <br/><br/>To be honest with you, I think the two types of game complement each other. I learned almost everything I know about running an old-school sandbox from AW system games, and running DCC has given me a whole new appreciation for the applications of randomized content insofar as creating interesting stories goes. <br/><br/>Or to sum up my thoughts on it after the second session "I've never had so much fun with 1d6 Ghouls!" <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
