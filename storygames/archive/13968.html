Go Play Northwest is astonishingly good, Camp Nerdly is unbeatable unless you are afraid of giant hornets, Forge Midwest, Nerdly Beach Party, Jiffycon.<br/><br/>Other than GPNW I'm unfamiliar with west coast conventions. Dreamation is the only con I know that views an "indie" presence as a confirmed money-maker, and they go well out of their way to be welcoming and hospitable to this crowd. This is reflected in the diversity and quality of games offered, and the diversity and quality of people who make strong efforts to attend.<br/><br/>For smaller regional gatherings that are not focused obsessively on Story Games darlings, I've heard a lot of good things about Fear the Con in St. Louis.<br/><br/>I think it is Fred Hicks who calls Gen Con his selling con, Origins his networking con, and Dreamation his playing con.

Personally, I find that I can't commit to running more than 1 game per day, can probably play in 1 or 2 more, and then need something else to do (sit around and talk with folks, wander the distributors booths, go outside for some air and food, etc.) to refresh my brains. Also, I really have trouble with multi-day cons, since my brains turn to slush after about two straight days of the above.<br/><br/>Consequently, traveling across the country for a multi-day brain-slushing event makes less and less sense.  Living in Seattle, with PAX Prime and GoPlay NW and Gamestorm and several other smaller cons within a few hours of me, those are the ones I'm most excited about.  This past year, I did Friday evening and most of Sunday at PAX, trading my badge to a friend for Saturday. That day in the middle was great for a brain refresh.  I did something similar at GoPlay, just showing up for the afternoon and evening activities, but spending the mornings at home.  Obviously, for out-of-towners, that may make less sense, but Seattle is a great place to visit and spending the mornings wandering downtown (where both PAX and GoPlay now are) sounds like a great idea to me, a nice mental break from the insanity.<br/><br/>If I was still in Boston, I imagine I'd do about the same thing with PAX Prime and JiffyCon, maybe riding the short train down to Dreamation as well.  If I was more centrally located I would think more about GenCon and Origins and Forge MW.  And in the Southeast I would probably do Dreamation and Camp Nerdly.  Less sure about the Southwest and California.<br/><br/>Lately too, some folks have been breaking into non-gaming-specific cons like comics, anime, and steampunk affairs, but that depends on you feeling a connection with those crowds and interests.

Both sell several thousand tickets, apparently. Tracon is much better as a sales venue for indies, for largely the same reasons you have in the USA between old and established vs. young and hungry conventions: free tables, more respect, less groupthink. Ropecon is more worthwhile for the sheer number of veteran roleplayers in attendance, which will also translate to better sales for anybody willing to court the mainstream.<br/><br/>For small in-crowd conventions I recommend my own house cons (the best gaming in Eastern Finland!) and the bi/triannual Maracon in Oulu, which at this point has a history rivalling all other Finnish conventions excepting Ropecon - very strong tradition, solid culture, international level of gamesmanship drawn from a small pool and cultivated with patience. Southern Finland doesn't boast the equal of these northern and eastern opportunities for some reason, perhaps because everybody is so busy setting up larger cons.<br/><br/>The only pan-European convention I've sampled is Spiel Essen, which I judge in many ways to be the equivalent of Gencon for Europeans; the greatest difference is that Spiel is primarily boardgames and only secondarily roleplaying, but the 400% higher attendance numbers basically still give you a plentiful roleplayer audience. The terms for participation are slightly better for indies, too, I understand. While the free gaming is undeniably worse than at Gencon, it's still basically what you make of it (via precon Internet scheduling and willingness to think on your feet at the fair, say), and the fair floor is in its own class altogether - you can spend the convention just talking, buying and participating in demoes, easily enough. Definitely my recommendation for any Europeans considering an international convention experience this year, and not only because I'll probably be there with bells on myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316473/#Comment_316473" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-13T16:25:40+00:00" title="March 13, 2011  4:25PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel suddenly obliged to note that there is a pretty neat con (though rather modest) at my alma mater, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

It's one of the best "gaming and nothing else" cons I've gone to, and it has a proportionally strong small press community presence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316882/#Comment_316882" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T19:36:54+00:00" title="March 16, 2011  7:36PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the input, folks.<br/><br/>More data: I'm in the Chicago suburbs.

If you're comfortable with gaming in English I do not foresee any significant trouble language-wise. Maracon weekend is the best time to visit insofar as gaming goes, and if you'll let me know that you're coming, I'll make a point of being there myself as well to add to the fun. It's a couple hours of driving for me to get to Oulu myself, and I find it eminently worthwhile a couple of times per year when I feel like mixing it up with the Ostrobothnic gamers. I especially appreciate the width of experience that Maracon attracts: you get both highly versed Forge hippies and totally old skool Mechwarriors, Gurpsists and whatnot. With a convention as intimate as Maracon I often end up swapping tales or playing some insane homebrews with people whose gaming experiences are highly orthogonal to my own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/michelegelli" title="michelegelli"><img alt="michelegelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/michelegelli">michelegelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317687/#Comment_317687" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-24T10:04:03+00:00" title="March 24, 2011 10:04AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2011 10:04AM by michelegelli.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can vouch for <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.internoscon.it/2011/index.cfm?action=news&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">InterNosCon</a> (once a year in italy, next time in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://maps.google.it/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=it&amp;geocode=&amp;q=bertinoro&amp;aq=&amp;sll=41.442726,12.392578&amp;sspn=23.874651,39.067383&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Bertinoro+Forl%C3%AC-Cesena,+Emilia+Romagna&amp;z=12" rel="nofollow">Bertinoro</a>, from april the 29th to May the 1st).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are still quite new but we got international guests, lots of gaming events (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.internoscon.it/2011/index.cfm?action=programma&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">lots of, and still counting</a>) both in english and italian, italian wine &amp; food and "untoppable" romagnas's hospitality.

It is the friendliest, best run small con I've ever attended.  The attendees truly do embrace the idea of community.  <br>The con officially started with a Wing Night socializer on Thursday.  Friday was 3 slots of gaming, plus a comedy show and a trivia contest.  Saturday was 3<br>more slots plus a live podcast recording.  <br/><br/>Throughout the entire con people would pleasantly introduce themselves and talk gaming with you if you looked bored,alone, or sat still too long <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>By then end I felt like I had been gaming with many new friends instead of just seeing people at a convention.  Conversation about all aspects of the con started on their forums<br/>before I had finished driving home, including discussions of people collaborating on games for next year.<br/><br/>As a player and GM, it was wonderful.  For a publisher/vendor, it would probably not be financially viable.  The attendance was about 200 folks.  The dealer room was essentially <br/>1 RPG/board game dealer, one soap vendor, one jewelry vendor, and a puzzle auction for charity.<br/><br/>The games were all over the spectrum.  For story games, there were at least 2 sessions of Fiasco, one DRYH, several Dresden, one PDQ, several Dread/Jenga hacks and  I personally ran 2 Lady Blackbird games and 2 Smallville games.  I've most assuredly missed some.  There were also many of old school games -  The Tomb of Horrors was run, BattleTech, and a ton of Savage Worlds.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317731/#Comment_317731" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-24T19:48:04+00:00" title="March 24, 2011  7:48PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Bay Area, there is also DunDraCon, which has its problems but essentially provides a private hotel room for each and every scheduled roleplaying session.
