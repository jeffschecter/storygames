                    Okay... so I'm going to be going to my girlfriend's place over Christmas, and need to bring presents for people.<br/>And my girlfriend's stepdad and his kid play Descent. And another similar game with tiled landscapes and miniatures and a lot of cards.<br/><br/>Chris (the stepdad) has developed his own scenarios and character classes and items for Descent (how cool is that?), which proves he's into the out-of-game parts of miniatures (painting, army building, etc) if I were to get him something like Warhammer stuff.<br/><br/>Curtis (the kid) is autistic. I'm not really sure what that means in terms of games he can grasp and games he'd struggle with/dislike. I know he likes Descent, and I know he likes finite choices (which is why an RPG wouldn't likely fly very far, unless it was a tactical d20ish one.)<br/><br/>So, with the fate of the world resting on my shoulders here (it is my girlfriend's dad, afterall), I need Story Games Community's help to pick the perfect gift.<br/><br/>Here are my thoughts so far:<br/>-Descent: Altar of Darkness expansion (Are expansions teh awesome for this game, or a waste of money?)<br/>-Shadows over Camelot (I've heard a lot about it, and would love a detailed pitch.)<br/>-Mordheim (the skirmish, city-fight game for Warhammer Fantasy)<br/>-Battle for Skull Pass (the starter-set for Warhammer Fantasy. two armies, rulebook, dice.)<br/>-a different Fantasy Flight Game (He's into those.)<br/><br/>Those range from $40CND (Altar of Darkness expansion) to $85CND (Mordheim... plus I'd need to buy a paint set).<br/>That's pretty much my max price range. I'm willing to spend a lot to win this man over, but not an infinite amount.<br/><br/>Ideas? Help?                </div>

                            Hmm. If he likes the DIY stuff, I'd suggest looking at megaminis fantasy multi-packs[<a href="http://www.megaminis.com/]" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.megaminis.com/]</a> and worldworks games printable terrain[<a href="http://www.worldworksgames.com/store/]" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.worldworksgames.com/store/]</a>, which both are non-system goodies that they could tack on to whatever they're already playing.                        </div>

                            I've got to totally plug the upcoming BATTLELORE, which is crunchy and tactical while still being light and fast, and there's a lot of room for scenario creation (which the stepdad will love). The only thing hard will be finding them come December if you don't preorder soon, plus the price tag (approx $70 US IIRC).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Carcassonne, yes. Highly recommended. Don't accidentally pick up Carcassonne Hunters and Gatherers - it's less expansible at the moment, and its scoring is much more opaque and sort of irritating in my opinion.</p>
<p>But, it's a good change of pace if you like classic Carcassonne.</p>
<p>I also like a lot of the Cheapass line of games; Kill Dr. Lucky is a lot of fun, as is Devil Bunny Needs a Ham and Bitin' Off Hedz. If you go Cheapass, I think it would be really cool to actually give the game and a kit of the bits-and-pieces you need to play it. Adds a personal touch.</p>

And if you go Cheapass, and you go Bitin' Off Hedz, and you go "give the bits" - make sure there's a set of plastic dinosaur figures in there.  They totally make the game *so* much more fun.<br/><br/>But yeah, I'll third Carcassone, and I'll also add that, as boardgames and general appeal go, Ticket to Ride is amazing in terms of replayability and finite choices within a given game.<br/><br/>Battlelore also looks great, but I haven't gotten to try it (or one of the other C&amp;C games) yet...<br/><br/>- D.J.                        </div>

                            My girlfriend loves Arkham Horror to death, and i got her the Game of Thrones board game for her birthday.<br/>
We haven't had time to play GoT but Arkham is fun, especially if your a Lovecraft fan. <br/>
I liked Mordheim for the same reasons i like Blood Bowl. They require just a few mini's and it doesn't take as longer to set up than it does to play. <br/>
 Blood Bowl is, or was when I played more often, geared towards pick a rag tag group of mini's  mod them up and make a team (fulfills the out of the game parts, bit).   It also has a chess aspect that may work towards the structure Curtis needs.<br/>
The drawback, however, is that it doesnt come in a pretty box, and the rules are free in pdf format  ( http://www.specialist-games.com/bloodbowl/default.asp) , so you come off looking kind of like a cheapskate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, although i am loathe to suggest  collectible (translate:money pit) games, i really like the construction and play of Wiz Kids Pirates and I've heard that Avalon Hill's Axis &amp; Allies game is doing well.                        </div>

                            I recently got a copy of Fantasy Flight's <b>Warrior Knights</b> game (apparently an update of an old game from 1985) and tried it out on Saturday.  It was cool, a lot of fun with lots of options and player interaction but without getting complicated.  Once you have the rules down (which look kinda complex but are actually really easy once you start playing) the game flows very well.  The expeditions feel a touch tacked on and the space on the board could instead have been given over as a place to put Laws that have been voted into affect in the Assembly but, other than that, I have no complaints.  It looks good and is of good quality, nice card counters and decent plastic miniatures and it can take anything from 3 to 6 players, although I get the feeling that the more players the more fun the game as it would force more player vs player interactions.<br/><br/>You mentioned <b>Shadows Over Camelot</b> in your opening post and I can't recommend that one highly enough!  It's a high quality game with good looks and pieces (and the picts, saxons and siege engines could certainly be painted up should someone feel that way inclined).  I also love the co-operative nature of the game.  It's all about the players vs the game and centres around resource management.  There's difficult choices to make about which quests to attempt and which ones to let slide and the tension really builds up towards the end game when the siege engines begin to pile up.  I've had great fun the 4 or 5 times that I've played it.                        </div>

                            Carcassonne was also my first thought - our FLGS has a guarantee on it that i you don't like it they'll take it back, no questions asked, they are that confident of its playability and appeal. One person once took advantage of that, and there were special circumstances. Along similar threads, Ticket to Ride and/or Thurn and Taxis are both strategic route laying games, good for teaching topography and quite fun and challenging without being hard.<br/><br/>Otherwise: dare I say it, lots of people have loved the D&amp;D board game. It has that sort of Warhammer Quest feel to it, which character expansion, even though it is limited, and little minis you can paint, cardboard trees which you can replace with ones you made yourself etc. etc. It has a couple of expansions which have proved popular as well. Though I know we loath them, the Clix games, especially Heroclix, do have a place here I'd say. Again, minis which you can collect (!), repaint or whatever, plus a nice squared map layout to keep the game quite straight forward but with potential for change. <br/><br/>High end: Risk 2210 if you want something a little more advanced. Not that complex, but a few rules to juggle at the same time and strategic choices about when to reveal cards and when to spend resources. Has a limited number of turns, so is nicely enclosed for someone who doesn't do well with huge numbers of choices. Dad might not find so much here unless he wants to make his own commanders, but could find the game itself more to his liking.                        </div>
