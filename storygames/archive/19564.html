Players take turn clockwise. On your turn, may choose either roll on the "Event" table and generate a horrible event for a world (or two, or three, etc.) and also generating Pressure in the process, or you may choose to "Relieve the Pressure", deciding how society will respond to these terrible events and reducing the Pressure that affects the world.<br/><br/>Once the 'Pressure' goes down to zero, you roll a 2d6 to determine the legal Threshold. If the number of events that happen that exceed than that Threshold, then the world ends with the "Great Dying" event. Otherwise, you move onto the next year. Repeat until the world ends.<br/><br/>I wanted to create an interesting apocalyptic timeline, so I tried out this system by myself. What happened may have been a rather...interesting...history. In fact, it is probably indeed the longest timeline ever made with this gaming system, due to me not rolling on the Event Table enough (thereby ensuring humanity will always sneak by). However, I did eventually see the "Great Dying" and wants to share with you this history.<br/><br/>I have divided this Timeline into several parts, as it is a pretty long timeline.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst" title="igorhorst"><img alt="igorhorst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst">igorhorst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434849/#Comment_434849" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T17:53:28+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  5:53PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>At this stage, I only rolled on the Event table twice per year.</i><br/><b>2020</b><br/>*Parasites has been detected in Louisiana, infecting many humans and causing them to adopt very aggressive behaviors.<br/>*To contain the parasitic outbreak, military forces occupy Louisiana and declare martial law in the region.<br/>*The parasites started cooperating with each other to resist the American martial law. They ended up developed their own unique ideology (\u201cAnticivilization\u201d) to justify their armed struggle. Anticivilization claimed that the parasitical infection is the \u201cnext stage of human evolution\u201d, and envision a future without any governments or corruption.<br/>*Small-scale protests are held to protest the military occupation, but they were quickly dispersed. Most of the organizers were accused of secretly working for the parasites.<br/><br/>*Tensions between the United States and China led to a cyberwar between the two superpowers. The United States Chinese and American hackers destroyed vast amounts of the Internet infrastructure in a desperate attempt to contain the \u201cother side\u201d. The Internet became a virtual wasteland.<br/>*Americans hackers introduced a virus into the Chinese power grid, shutting down electricity throughout the entire country. Rolling blackouts became commonplace. With this tactical success, the Americans are considered the \u2018victor\u2019 in this cyberwar.<br/>*China\u2019s defeat in the cyberwar revealed massive weaknesses within the Communist Party\u2019s civilian leadership. To remedy these weaknesses, the People\u2019s Army has declared a \u2018corrective revolution\u2019 and seized complete control over the Chinese government. Military commanders became the predominant ruling class, advised by elite hackers. <br/><br/>Events: 3<br/>Threshold: 10<br/><br/><b>2021</b><br/>*The parasites escaped the Louisiana occupation and spread throughout the United States. A parasite managed to board onto a ship heading to China, thereby spreading the disease into that country.<br/>*Survivalists started established private \u201cvaults\u201d to protect themselves from the Parasites and prepare for armageddon. The Vaults were self-sufficient and relied on private security firms to provide order (as the survivalists distrusted the federal government).<br/><br/>*The Chinese military approved a \u201chacking resistance operation\u201d, thereby restarting the cyberwar. This \u201chacking resistance\u201d, along with the \u201cextreme response\u201d by American hackers, finally destroyed what\u2019s left of the Internet, undermining the US economy and potentially giving a boost to Chinese military capabilities. Communications throughout the world has to rely on non-Internet sources until the Americans can find some way to repair the Internet Backbone.<br/><br/>*The Chinese military junta proved unable to restore order within the country. As rioting and looting became commonplace, liberal opposition forces joined forces with the Chinese paraistical infection to establish a rival government (the Democratic Republic of China). The DRC aims to seize power away from the military junta and establish a \u201ctrue democracy\u201d..<br/><br/>Events: 2<br/>Threshold: 11<br/><br/><b>2022</b><br/>*The Democratic Republic of China has seized control over the Chinese government, overthrowing the military junta and executing their commanders. The parasitical infection has already compromised the liberal opposition, meaning that the parasites essentially rules over China with an iron fitst. The paraistes hungrily eyes the United States.<br/>*The United States declares the Democratic Republic of China as a \u2018rogue state\u2019, and have decided on a prompt intervention to crush the parasites, restore order, and possibly end the threat China poses to its East Asian neighbors. \u201cMeat\u201d war breaks out, including a limited nuclear exchange.<br/><br/>*The United States military restarts the Internet Backbone, hardening the backbone to protect it from Chinese cyber-attacks. International observers fear that the military is secretly placing the Internet under its full control.<br/><br/>*With China falling into complete anarchy due to the constant regime changes, off-grid communities began to be set up, and declared their opposition to the Democratic Republic. Many of these off-grid communities are aligned with either the civilian Communist Party or the former military junta. <br/>*The Democratic Republic denounces these off-grid communities as being \u201cwarlord states\u201d and move to attack and annihilate them. The off-grid communities respond by assembling their own private militaries to protect themselves from the Democratic Republic. These private militaries are able to fight off the \u201cInfected\u201d with some success, and as a result, has gained the moniker \u201cthe Anti-Infected\u201d.<br/><br/>Events: 2<br/>Threshold: 5<br/><br/><b>2023</b><br/>*World War 3 comes to a (bloody) close. The \u201climited nuclear exchange\u201d had escalated to a full-blown nuclear onslaught. With the US having total nuclear primacy, the United States has successfully bathed China with nuclear radiation. The Democratic Republic was only able to nuke a few minor targets in response, such as Southern California and Oregon, before being effectively destroyed.<br/><br/>*The nuclear war changed the climate of the ecosystem drastically, causing a \u201cnuclear winter\u201d. Temperatures dropped to dangerously low levels, threatening agriculture throughout the world.<br/>*Global famine occurred as a result of lower agricultural yields. Scientists gleefully claim that the nuclear winter will only last for a few years, and then agricultural yields will pick back up. Somehow, the general population is not satisfied with this response.<br/><br/>*The nuclear war had also destroyed arable Chinese farmland. As a result, China faces massive famines, compounding Chinese woes.<br/><br/>*With food being an incredibly scarce resource, the bartering for food becomes commonplace throughout the world. <br/>*The US government steps in to implement a rationing system to help ensures the survival of its citizens. Other countries ends up implementing their own rationing systems.<br/><br/>Events: 4<br/>Threshold: 8<br/><br/><b>2024</b><br/>*Despite American victory in World War 3, US policymakers expressed concern about lingering parasitical populations that may have still survived. They therefore supported a long-term military occupation of China to rebuild the country and establish a truly democratic government. US troops quickly comes in conflict with the various off-grid communities who refuses to submit themselves to the US-backed puppet regime.<br/><br/>*The US military, having gained a tremendous amount of influence over American policymakers, has decided to assume full control over the American government. Martial law has been declared throughout the entire country, to \u201cadminister the rationing system\u201d and \u201cannihilate the Parasite traitors that lives with us\u201d.<br/><br/>*The nationwide martial law has proven incredibly unpopular with the American public as well as a subset of military personnel. In addition, the American public had no appetite for fighting a long-term insurgency in China and wants more attention to be spent on domestic affairs. A civil war breaks out within the United States, between Pro-Junta forces and Pro-Democracy forces. <br/><br/>Events: 2<br/>Threshold: 3<br/><br/><b>2025</b><br/>*Parasites secretly infiltrated Pro-Democracy forces and led them to victory against the American military junta. The American generals are all executed, and the US military pulls out of China. The US-backed puppet regime quickly collapsed, and China falls into a three-way civil war between civilian communists, militarists, and parasites.<br/>*With the parasites now in full control over America, and safe from the possibility of extermination, they begin implementing their \u201cAnticivilization\u201d ideology onto the general public. All forms of private property is abolished, and everyone \u201cowns\u201d everyone else. The parasites also seeks to convert even more people to loyal \u201cInfected\u201d drones.<br/><br/>*The global economic system, based on capitalism and free markets, cannot be reconciled with the Anticivilization Revolution\u2019s radical egalitarianism. As a result, the United States pulls itself out of the global economic system, causing the global market to collapse.  <br/>*With the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the world economy, there are now two main superpowers left: Europe and India. They supported the United States during World War 3, but now view each other as geopolitical rivals.<br/><br/>Events: 2<br/>Threshold: 9<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst" title="igorhorst"><img alt="igorhorst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst">igorhorst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434850/#Comment_434850" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T17:57:33+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  5:57PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I now started rolling on the Event Table 3 times a year.</i><br/><b>2026</b><br/>*The \u201clong nuclear winter\u201d that started in 2023 has put immense pressure on the global agricultural system. With food now being the main source of currency after the market collapse of 2025, whoever can gain the most arable land would become the leading economic superpower.<br/><br/>And the most arable land lied on the African subcontinent.<br/><br/>Both India and Europe started grabbing as much land as they could, by bribing and propping up corrupt African warlords. And arable land could not be shared between these two imperialist Regions, so Indian and European proxies started engaged in armed conflict with each other. Africa descends into complete anarchy.<br/><br/>*The Europeans and the Indians decided to send in military \u201cadvisors\u201d to prop up their local proxies, then actual military troops to protect those advisors. A series of skirmishes soon erupt into a globalized World War 4, with South America and Australia also being scenes of fighting.<br/><br/>*The parasites, in the hopes of spreading their revolution to other parts of the world, turned off the Internet Backbone entirely, thereby depriving most of Western society of valuable Internet access. The Europeans had sought to purchase the Internet Backbone from the Infected, but the Infected refused the offer, seeing the \u201cBackbone\u201d as an integral part of the \u2018corrupt civilization\u2019 they wish to annihilate.<br/><br/>*The Europeans lost battle after battle against the Indian forces, and ensuring that the Indians monopolized valuable arable land. The loss of Internet access also hammered the European economy. As a result, Europe could not maintain any internal cohesion and balkanized. India became the winner of World War 4, by default.<br/><br/>Events: 3<br/>Threshold: 4<br/><br/><b>2027</b><br/>*A meteor hits a major European trading hub between the various post-WW4 European warlords. <br/>*By destroying this trading hub, these European warlords were unable to secure a regular supply of food. As a result, numerous industries were forced to rely on coercion instead of regular \u201cfood payments\u201d. While this does lead to production quotas to be fulfilled, it does lead to a lack of safety standards and professionalism. One of these industries, a nuclear power plant, had a little \u2018accident\u2019, leading to the nearby area to be irradiated.<br/>*At first, one industrial accident is not a big deal, but as more of these industrial accidents occur, more and more power plants get turned off. For the first time in centuries, Europe was left without power. A new Dark Ages has begun. <br/>*With the fall of the Internet Backbone in 2027, European warlords relied on cellphones to communicate with their troops. Without adequate power to sustain the cellular/satellite/telephone networks though, the networks began to be shut down, further isolating Europe from the rest of civilized world...<br/><br/>*In China, the ongoing and often-time violent civil war has led to chaos. Various highways were damaged in the fighting between the parasites and the off-grid communities.<br/>*To help sustain the conflict, the warring Chinese forces raided the Indian state for various resources. Fighting between these Chinese \u201craiders\u201d and the Indian military also lead to severe damages to infrastructure, especially in the transportation sector where most fighting takes place. The Indians are reluctant to invade China to stop these \u201craiders\u201d though, knowing what happened when the US got itself involved in Chinese affairs.<br/><br/>*The \u201cAnticivilization\u201d Revolution was successful in transforming the United States into an anarcho-primitivist state. But it failed in creating an anarcho-primitivist [i]utopia.[/i] The parasites had thought that by destroying all technological advances, that mankind would somehow revert to a purified \u2018state of nature\u2019. They did not realize the severe costs, both of living standards and of human casualties, that their revolution may cause.<br/>*The underground American \u201cvaults\u201d finally started to run out of supplies, and have resorted to sending out hunting parties to scavange through the wreckage of post-Revolution USA. What they find was not pretty, and many \u201cVaulters\u201d believed it may have been better had they died during the nuclear war instead.<br/><br/>*Organized \u201csociety\u201d itself begins to break down in all parts of the world, in favor of neo-feudalism based on agriculture. Warlords in Europe and China focus entirely on forcing citizens to work for them with meager rations and extreme violence/torture. The parasites, now having lost the support of the general population due to their general incompetence, are starting to following the footsteps of the European/Chinese warlords. The Indians run their own massive feudal empire that cross oceans, but they are unable to maintain much control over the behavior of their \u201cvassals\u201d, allowing them to do as they please so long as the food keeps flowing. <br/><br/>Events: 7<br/>Threshold: 12<br/><br/><b>2028</b><br/>*The parasites, realizing that their hosts are dying due to lack of arable lands, has embarked on a course to \u201cevolve\u201d to adapt to these changing circumstances. The end result is a new strain of parasites...the \u201cConsumers\u201d. The Consumers do not bother living in a human, they instead eat the human! The parasites are obviously horrified, and reject their new brethren.<br/>*The Consumers, however, do not see the USA as having any \u201cmeat\u201d worth devouring. Instead, they go to the place where humans are plenty...the Indian Feudal Empire. The Consumers begin preying on the humans, only using them as incubators for their spores.<br/><br/>*A surprise drop in agricultural yields throughout the world suggest that the \u201cnuclear winter\u201d will not end. It also puts extreme pressure on the Indian Feudal Empire, as many of its \u201cvassals\u201d become more reluctant to share their surplus with the bureaucrats in New Delhi. <br/>*With the Indians being seen as weak due to its rebellious vassals and arrival of the Consumers, various local African warlords began resisting Indian imperialism. Their armed insurgency seems to gather popular support due to their slogan of \u201cAfrica for the Africans!\u201d. <br/><br/>Events: 3<br/>Threshold: 6<br/><br/><b>2029</b><br/>*The parasites\u2019 incompetence only seems to compound problems in the United States. While America burns, the Infected focuses more on refining their \u201cAnticiv\u201d ideology. When it turns out that refining the \u201cAnticiv\u201d ideology didn\u2019t actually work in solving mass starvation, the parasites blame \u201cinternal traitors\u201d and started mass witch-hunts and political purges. The parasites cast blame on cast blame on anyone and anything other than their ideology, which is so obviously pure and correct that it must not be implemented properly.<br/><br/>More and more die from utter starvation, due to the lack of arable lands. The \u201cless ideologically pure\u201d parasites has chosen to fled the United States and turn into Consumers.<br/><br/>*A series of droughts expands throughout Africa, causing agricultural yields to go down...to zero. The vassal states now are so weakened that they had no choice but to defect to the African Resistance to ensure their survival. Africa has declared its \u201cde facto\u201d independence from India.<br/><br/>*The Indian mainland is now rather chaotic, as the Consumers set up semi-permanent raiding bases and the Chinese raids are stepped up. Several rebellious ethnic minorities also started taking up arms, seeing an opportunity to gain independence. The Indian Feudal Empire only remains powerful in urban areas, but rural locations remain incredibly unstable.<br/><br/>*The Europeans awoke from their Dark Ages with a new unity and purpose. This \u2018unity and purpose\u2019 was originally inspired by a European warlord trying to ensure a stable, docile population that will will for his industries and not complain about hunger. The Europeans claim that they are being led by a \u201cPsychic Maelstrom\u201d. The Indians are more correct when they refer to it as "mass insanity". <br/><br/>Events: 3<br/>Threshold: 9                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst" title="igorhorst"><img alt="igorhorst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst">igorhorst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434851/#Comment_434851" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T17:59:40+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  5:59PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I have tried the \u201cWar\u201d variant rules for one year.

After I have finished the timeline, <b>AsIf</b>, the person who made this game, stated that he would overhaul the "War" variant rules.</i><br/><b>2030</b><br/>*The European Maelstrom needed arable in order to feed its population. Seeing Africa as a fairly risky proposition for invasion, the Maelstrom instead focused its efforts on conquering the \u201cMoscow Pact\u201d, a loose confederation of Russian and Middle Eastern warlord states who banded together to resist Indian imperialism. The Maelstrom\u2019s forces started bombing the Moscow Pact to weaken them. One of their bombing runs targeted the city of Moscow itself, and the Kremlin was crushed.<br/>*Confident that their bombing runs had weakened the Moscow Pact, the Maelstormordered a full-scale military invasion of the Pact.<br/>*The Moscow Pact retaliates by sending terrorists into Europe to nuke important strategic locations in Europe, in the hopes of throwing Europe back into the Dark Ages. The damage to infrastructure severely hampers the Maelstrom\u2019s ability to send supplies to the warfront.<br/><br/>*The European warlords has begun to be so afraid of the Maelstrom\u2019s power that they have started forming their own \u201cBiospheres\u201d where non-Maelstormlife would be able to survive. Obviously, the warlords only build Biospheres for themselves and their most loyal followers. But the Biospheres would serve as protection, in case the Maelstormchooses to betray them. The Biospheres are also kept fully guarded with automated weapons.<br/><br/>*The Russian warlords started blaming their technology for their problems, and started reducing their own technological use in order to produce a more \u201csustainable lifestyle\u201d. The Russians also embrace a religious cult that reject all forms of technology in favor of a purer life. They also denounce the \u201cAnticiv\u201d movement in the United States as being based on Secular Luddism, as opposed to their moral Religious Luddism.<br/><br/>*The Indians are so angry at losing their African vassals that they cut off all their \u2018military assistance\u2019 to the African warlords, and even started ordering their military troops to assault the warlords. A lack of the \u201csecurity resource\u201d causes the Resistance to fall into anarchy.<br/>*The power vacuum in Africa can inspire people to go onto great lengths to fill that power vacuum. One ambitious warlord has just done so, a technophile who argued that since Africa is the birthplace of humanity, it deserves to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rule</span> over humanity. Instead of simply claiming \u201cAfrica for Africans\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cThe World Must Bow Down.\u201d A series of military campaigns and feudalistic obligations lead to the Resistance being formulated as a new \u2018empire\u2019: the Second Central African Empire.<br/>*The Second Central African Empire also invested heavily in building a more permanent security force, to keep Africa stable.<br/><br/>*The Africans started throwing their efforts on a last-ditch effort to save humanity. They believe that their repeated droughts are connected in some way to the Nuclear Winter. They decide that the only way, the only way, to save the human race (and by extension, their society) is to reverse the \u201cnuclear winter\u201d.<br/><br/>Modifying the climate is a rather dangerous process. It\u2019s even illegal, as the Africans are doing it on their own without international support and consensus. But international law has fallen by the wayside in the last couple of years, and the Africans sees no other valid choice.<br/><br/>So the Africans\u2019 first experiment led to good rainstorms that helped end the famine. It also led to bad rainstorms that pounded the Indian coast and caused further damage to its economy.<br/>*The rainstorms destroyed many ports on the Indian coast, further hampering communications and trade between the Indian mainland and their \u201cvassals\u201d in South America and Australia.<br/><br/>*The Chinese also started feeling the effects of the Africans\u2019 meddling of the climate. Extreme heat occurred as a result of the Indian\u2019s tinkering.<br/>*The Chinese are also starting to see reduced agricultural yields as the extreme heat can also reduces agriculture.<br/>*The Chinese starts drawing on more water to help boost agricultural yields, putting more strain on the water grid.<br/>*It didn\u2019t work. Without any food to pay their supporters, the Chinese warlords has no way to motivate anyone, at all, to follow them.<br/><br/>So nobody even bothered.<br/><br/>The off-grid communities are being dismantled as its residents start looting them for preparation of their lives as solitary scavengers. The parasites start cannibalizing each other. Society has not \u201cbroke down\u201d, it is now dead. Life is nasty, brutish, and short. As a beneficial side-note, the Chinese raids into India has diminished.<br/><br/>*The Indian Feudal Empire, already in the process of degeneration, starts following an extreme form of Hindu religious supremacy, alienating their non-Hindu vassals in the process. The Indians are forcing their vassals to stop beef slaughters, for instance. \u201cHindu supremacy\u201d led to the use of extreme violence to calm the non-Hindu uprisings on the mainland, which were successful in suppressing the uprisings, but are seen by the international community as very barbaric.<br/>*Several South American warlords declared independence, thereby copying the Africans\u2019 successful strategy for independence. The South Americans seek to pursue their own path free from the taint of \u201cHindu supremacy\u201d.<br/><br/>No \u2018region\u2019 suffered \u201cThe Great Dying\u201d this year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst" title="igorhorst"><img alt="igorhorst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst">igorhorst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434852/#Comment_434852" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T18:00:59+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  6:00PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I now started rolling on the Event Table 5 times a year.</i><br/><b>2031</b><br/>*The Africans continue their modification of the environment, leading to desertification of the Earth.

They find that the Consumers can be neutralized by an antidote that is very rare in the natural world.<br/>*However, it can be made \u201cnot-rare\u201d. The Indians research a fast and efficient way to cure the Consumers and dedicate all their spare power towards mass-producing the cure and applying it to the Consumers. This led to less power towards civilian and agricultural yields. The Indians gamble that if the Consumers are knocked out, then all threats to their power is eliminated. After all, the Chinese raiders aren\u2019t going to bother them, as their society is long since gone, and they exterminated the non-Hindu rebels.<br/>*It turns out that the mass-production of antidotes isn\u2019t a cheap process. It puts massive strain on the power grid, and when the Consumers start attacking power stations in an attempt to stop the antidote production, entire power stations start falling out. India starts turning black.<br/><br/>*The European Maelstrom, angry at the development of Biospheres and the unwillingness of the warlords to blindly follow it, turn against them, attacking their highway systems in an attempt to intimidate them into leaving the Biosphere proper and submitting themselves fully to Maelstorm rule.<br/>*The Maelstrom then turned its attention towards the Moscow Pact. Hoping to claim valuable arable land and restore European pride and glory in the process, the Maelstrom invents a biological plague and sends it to the Moscow Pact. It hopes that the plague will depopulate humanity but keeps the arable land intact. If it killed non-Russians, it\u2019d be just a bonus.<br/><br/>The Maelstrom had to resort to biological warfare as it could not trust the warlords to keep \u201ctheir side of the bargain\u201d.<br/>*The Russian warlords realize that their Luddism has not prepared them for a biological plague. They also noticed that all skilled scientists have already been killed off in the chaos, so they got no way to counter it. So the plague just continues to spread throughout the world. The only people with the technical knowledge of stopping this plague (the Indians) are in no position to start mass production of the cure.<br/>*By this point, the civilized world realizes that the Europeans are the greatest threat to global society. The Indians, Africans, and Moscow Pact put aside their differences to form a coalition against the European Maelstrom. World War 5 officially begins.<br/><br/>No, they don\u2019t have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> way to stop the pandemic, and they aren\u2019t even trying. Instead, their goal is to annihilate the Europeans, before they could produce another pandemic. One could even view this fifth World War as a distraction of sorts, to show that they are \u201csolving\u201d the crisis, when in fact, they can\u2019t.<br/><br/>*The Anticiv Parasites finally realize what they have done to their country, and has fallen into despair and delusion as an attempt to cope with the realization that they have ruined the United States. Most of them starve to death, but a few survivors, still trying to promote the Anticiv ideology, destroys the last of the road systems in the US out of incoherent rage. The United States is now free from the taint of Parasites, leaving the Vaulters as the sole inheritors of the country.<br/>*The Vaulters were paranoiacs when they entered into the Vaults in 2021 (the dying days of the \u201cGolden Age\u201d). Dismissed as crazed, religious extremists. Reactionaries who were not a meant to be a part of a liberal, secular society. Intolerant bigots. The civilized world laughed as the trash built their walls and sealed themselves inside.<br/><br/>As the Vaulters walk in the wreckage of Post-Revolution USA, they silently say to themselves \u201cthe meek inherits the earth.\u201d <br/><br/>*The neofeudalism that characterized the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Iron Age of 2025-2030</span> doesn\u2019t seem all that practical anymore, due to desertification making arable land scarce. Society has broken down yet again, this time into \u201causterity tribalism\u201d. Everyone is \u201ctechnically\u201d equal and share resources communally. Even human life is considered the property of the community, and may be eaten. It\u2019s still a major taboo to eat people outside of the community, but inside of the community, it\u2019s considered only polite. <br/>*Organized empires again, make no sense in this new societal organization. The different communities are now all independent, and only interact with each other with diplomatic communications. They are all reliant on themselves, as they cannot rely on trade with the outside world. That trade can be disrupted, after all.<br/>--As a result, the \u201cSecond Central African Empire\u201d, the \u201cIndian Feudal Empire\u201d, and the \u201cMoscow Pact\u201d collapsed completely and utterly.<br/>--World War 5 still continues though, as the military units that were sent to fight against the Maelstrom will still carry out the orders given to them by their previous commanders. However, the actual citizens that stayed behind are no longer interested in such a war.<br/><br/>Events: 10<br/>Threshold: 10<br/><br/><b>2032</b><br/>*A major solar flare takes place, disrupting radio communication, the most reliable way by which the Indian-African-Russian alliance can communicate with one another to plot strategy against the Maelstrom.  This enable the Maelstrom to win key battles in World War 4.<br/><br/>*The Pandemic mutates into a sapient collective, able to think for itself. It then turns on their Maelstrom masters, viewing it as a unpredictable threat. The Pandemic wants to spread and live, and sees the Maelstrom's actions as a threat to the human species as a whole. If humanity dies off, so will the Pandemic.<br/>*The Pandemic focuses its effort on targeting the key elements that hold European society together. They take out the leaders and experts, disable water purification facilities, exterminate food producing crops, etc. Their targeted interventions weakened the Maelstrom, as the Maelstrom is dependent on its human slaves. The European system is on the brink of utter disaster\u2026<br/><br/>*Water shortages are still a major problem facing all of humanity, and the various tribes are unwilling to spend time fighting a war against the Euros while they still are too busy scavenging for food. Cannibalism becomes a way of life, as it removes the \u201cmore mouths to fill\u201d problem. <br/>*The local communities has also started waging \u201cwater skirmishes\u201d over strategic water wells and reservoirs. Water treatment and distribution facilities are the focus of military raids and strikes, and some of them have been damaged in the fighting.<br/><br/>*The effects of African climate change has caused extreme flooding in the United States Eastern Seaboard, just as the Vaulters has begun settling themselves in. However, relief efforts had been spotty at best, as the Vaulters are ill-prepared for governance. Many survivors were cannibalized.<br/><br/>*The wealthy warlords in both Africa and India had already realized that there is no hope for survival on Earth, since 2030. So, covertly, silently, they dedicated their resources towards a space program. Their goal is to colonize the Moon, and establish a base that would be self-sufficient. Only their most valuable and prized serfs are taken with them up into space.<br/><br/>Events: 6<br/>Threshold: 8                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst" title="igorhorst"><img alt="igorhorst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/igorhorst">igorhorst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434853/#Comment_434853" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T18:02:18+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  6:02PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2014 6:03PM by igorhorst.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>2033</b><br/>*The Maelstrom successfully kills off the Pandemic, by isolating its vectors and quietly quietly eliminating them.<br/>*It does this \u201cquiet elimination\u201d by using nuclear weapons Entire landscapes are irradiated and unsuited for human life or for agriculture, but they are acceptable losses to the Maelstrom <br/>*The Maelstrom however did not realize it would be unacceptable losses for humanity. There are now no more humans living in the Maelstrom's domain. Only the Maelstrom is alive, and it cannot really fight World War 5 by itself.<br/>*So the Maelstrom starts negotiating with the military forces that were sent to fight against it. These soldiers, known collectively as the \u201cGunluggers\u201d, were unwilling to return back to their home societies. They heard the horror stories of starvation and oppression, and weren\u2019t particularly interested in serving a race that is too stupid to live. So the \u201cGunluggers\u201d agreed to work for the Maelstrom, and in return, the Maelstrom allowed the Gunluggers to build their own private Biospheres. World War 5 ended with a truce.<br/>--In these Biospheres, the Gunluggers practiced eugenics in the hopes of creating a more purer human race. Some of the most excellent \u201cveterans\u201d were placed into cryogenic storage, to be brought back to lead the Gunluggers if necessary.<br/><br/>*The most effective way of producing food and water requires power, and there just isn\u2019t enough power for everyone to get. This is especially true in India which has its power grid ruined due to its policy of trying to develop antidotes. The Indian remnant successor communities must make a decision on how to handle the all-important issue of power\u2026<br/>*...and so begun the Power Wars (a civil war within the former Indian Feudal Empire). The communities aren\u2019t interested in territorial conquest though. That just mean more mouths to fill. What they want is extermination. If the enemy dies, then that means they won\u2019t be able to get control over power.<br/><br/>*The Africans are also trying to worry about power as well, as they want to still produce stable agricultural-based societies, and they need power to fund industrialization efforts. Maybe the African Empire is long since dead, but the idea of African Nationalism is still alive. Maybe the Africans can resolve this crisis with greater finesse than the Indians... <br/>*The Africans decided that, since corpses are a common sight, that they could burn those corpses to produce power. Of course, sometimes, corpses are in short supply, but that\u2019s why you start killing dissenters so that you can then burn their corpses to produce power to feed the rest of society.<br/>*The Elders of these tribal communities see the use of life and death as a way to seize control over their so-called egalitarian communities. The idea of \u201causterity tribalism\u201d falls on the wayside as the Elders consolidate control over their fiefdoms, by killing off those they disagree with. The Elders aren\u2019t interested in expansion (yet), just ruling their own little piece of Hell.<br/>*These tribal Elders started communicating with one another, and agreed to reunify themselves into a semi-coherent political nation-state. After all, they secured a useful and renewable power supply, and are on the road to recovery. The Third Central African Empire was formed, and neofeudalism was once again reinstated, though lip service is still paid to the idea of local austerity tribalism.<br/>*The African Elders, however, suspect that the Earth may still not be a good place for humanity. They didn\u2019t call it migration, of course, but they did do just that, setting the plans for the colonization of the Moon. They know that they will fight against the wealthy warlords already living there and extracting resources. But the Africans are geniuses, ready to fight for their survival and their destiny birthright. The World Must Bow Down.<br/><br/>*The American Vaulters turn their religious extremism on each other, fighting wars over petty doctrinal differences. These \u201creligious wars\u201d are really motivated by grudges over scarce water and arable lands, but the infusion of religious zeal makes these wars fairly brutal. Like the \u201cPower Wars\u201d, the Vaulters are only interested in extermination at this stage, as conquest means more mouths to feed. <br/><br/>*The Eastern Seaboard begins to be flooded again\u2026<br/>*...which led to an ecosystem collapse on the Eastern Seaboard. The Eastern Vaulters could not cope with the constant floods and has to postpone their vendettas with other Vaulters while they find a sufficient survival strategy (or at least a good migration route).<br/>*During this time, some of the more heretical Eastern Vaulters recovered genetic data from the \u201cRevolution\u201d government about the Consumers. The Eastern Vaulters then infected themselves with the Consumers\u2019 virus, in the hopes of being effective at combat. They didn\u2019t really want to corrupt their genetic heritage given to them by God, but then again, God willed for that flood to take place. Maybe this infection is God\u2019s will.<br/>*The Vaulters\u2019 genetic experiments had a slight error, but in fact, it served as their utter salvation. The Vaulters are now willing to start eating metal. Since the ruins of North America had lots of metal, the heretical Vaulters are able to secure a lasting food supply.<br/>*Now the non-mutated Vaulters are starting to feel the pain of hunger, as the Mutated Vaulters started eating up valuable infrastructure, making it difficult for them to continue their brutal resource wars. Starvation has now begun a major issue for the religious Vaulters...and there was no way they can stop it.<br/>*So the religious Vaulters sought to deny the Mutated Vaulters food. As they began dying, the religious Vaulters blew up any sort of metal or civilization they can find. The Mutated Vaulters walked around looking for more food to satiate their appetite, but could not find any\u2026<br/><br/>Events: 15<br/>Threshold: 4<br/><b>The Great Dying takes place.</b><br/>---<br/><b>2034</b><br/>The Mutated Vaulters were not going to give up as easily as their backward non-mutated Vaulters. The Mutated Vaulters were going to spread to other parts of the world, looking for more metal to consume. After all, it\u2019s not like the United States was worth anything more to them. It was meant to be a temporary home, to be thrown away when it loses its worth. The Mutated Vaulters now sees themselves now as \u201cGod\u2019s Chosen\u201d, the true rulers of Earth, and that they are now living in God\u2019s Paradise. <br/><br/>The Mutated Vaulters caused massive damage to African and Indian society, especially in destroying what\u2019s left of infrastructure. However, they had no sense of self-preservation. They were only interested in eating and eating, without care for creating a sustainable farming environment. The Mutated Vaulters\u2019 populations would soon dwindle.<br/><br/>The warring Indian states soon found themselves a strange ally: the Consumers. The Consumers were willing to work with the Indians, because, after all, the Consumers just want food as much as the Indians do. The Consumers played a mostly subservient role within Indian society, as they lust for stability and food (both in the short-term, by eating their enemies, and in the long-term, when power would be secured and a stable food supply is established). So long as the Consumers gets to eats, they are happy. The Indians generally used the Consumers as cannon fodder against the Mutated Vaulters\u2019 savage advances. When the Mutated Vaulters started to die off, the Indians used the Consumers against each other.<br/><br/>As for the Africans, their plans for migration were brought to a premature halt. Though their empire would still remain intact, the damage to infrastructure is so great that a space program would ultimately fizzled out.<br/>---<br/>In 2034, 14 years after the beginning of the timeline, the human race now is at 10% of the original \u201cGolden Age\u201d population. The anchors of civilization is slowly being rebuilt though, as now the population of humanity is at a sustainable level. Humanity may return back to the prosperity of the \u201cIron Age\u201d, or even of the \u201cGolden Age\u201d. But the scars will still remain.<br/>---<br/><b>Description of Post-Apoc World:</b><br/>The world has unpredictable weather patterns. Travel is difficult due to the severe damage to infrastructure. Food and water are scarce and heavily rationed. There are three loosely connected mega-tribes in the world today: the Brainers (Africans), the Skinners (Consumers-Indian hybrids), and the Gunluggers. There are also minor tribal communities littered throughout the world. Most humans scavenge for day-to-day survival. People looking on the Moon can sometimes see explosions.<br/><br/><b>FIN</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434873/#Comment_434873" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T15:06:56+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  3:06PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>*applause*</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
