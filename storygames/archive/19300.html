Don't know if this is a trend you've noticed or whether I'm jumping the gun, but I'd like to get out a few questions and see if we can't get a discussion a-goin'! <br/><br/>Do you think designers avoid modern settings? I feel like I steer clear of them when I dabble. Maybe I'm worried I'll be perceived as a poorly informed journalist on contemporary issues? Or conducting a soap opera, or even worse - having literary aspirations! Could be I was put off by playing the Vampire games - where the "real" world was this boring place filled with authority figures and disempowerment (woah! Who needs <i>psychiatrics</i>, right? Deep look into teen-Mike there). <br/><br/>Yet some games with contemporary settings have been really cool and worthwhile! Perhaps they're the ones that make you really live the life of a character, rather than some historical personage or tactical chit. Which is probably why they're a bit intimidating? <br/><br/>What do you think?<br/>Mike                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429778/#Comment_429778" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T13:38:06+00:00" title="March 23, 2014  1:38PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2014 9:32AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're absolutely right that contemporary settings can be cool and worthwhile (the majority of suspense movies are set in the modern day for instance), but I don't think depth of role is intimidating for avid storygamers, regardless of the setting.

But of course this is a question movie directors deal with as well.  Some of them want to do seriously authentic period pieces drenched in detail, while others want to recreate the feeling of fast-paced comic books, or brain-twisting postmodern novels, etc, while some maverick directors just want to push the medium in directions nobody else has thought of.  And then a new wave of young directors comes along, they get all those options, plus the added options of evolving or perpetuating the style of any earlier director.<br/><br/>It does seem that Hollywood has more interest in creating campy pseudo-historical romps and riffs (in which any historical reference is really just a symbolic nod) than serious period pieces.  I think that's ultimately because the former generate more profit than the latter, and of course they are also cheaper to produce.

My point was that the motivations of gamers and designers aren't necessarily that different.<br/><br/>I'm actually interested in realism in games and I have played, run and designed games with fairly modern subjects that lack supernatural elements. Fantasy has been just a sideshow in my own design lately, because real world subjects seem easier to tackle now that I'm getting older. But fantasy is still what unites most of us, and it's cool to show your friends or customers something that you know is in their comfort zone.<br/><br/>Why did Gygax and Arneson choose the fantasy genre and why has it stayed so popular? Fantasy was relatively visible in early 70s, which was the time of Tolkien and Howard booms. It's conservative, kitchen-sink, easy for the GM and the player. You don't have to worry about science or social implications (even if some do): you can just throw in about anything, and people won't get too upset, because they know this ain't supposed to model reality.

It doesn't matter that one show solves it by making a legal case, while another show solves it by investigating weird diseases. (Heck, there's a lot of area for blending the "flavors" of procedurals.) What matters is that basic dramatic thrust.<br/><br/>Of course, they can also swing to relationship drama. (We've been discussing this on RPG.net) The color is less important than the main action of the game. (For instance, I'd use GUMSHOE to run a procedural but Cortex Plus Drama to run a relationship drama. It wouldn't matter whether that particular show was about lawyers, detectives, or medical staff.)<br/><br/>Might not be a bad idea to focus on "procedural" and "drama" as the two pillars of TV show gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429951/#Comment_429951" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-25T10:58:32+00:00" title="March 25, 2014 10:58AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2014 11:03AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that just might be a thing.

But - just to play devil's advocate a little here - it's possible to picture a modern-day <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> featuring some sort of weird militant heretical Catholic sect.  (<i>Boondock Saints</i>, anybody?)  In such a game, we might expect stats like <i>Sin-Virtue</i> and actions like <i>Atonement</i> to be quite necessary, though they're far from necessary in most other modern-world games.  I'm just sayin'.<br/><br/>To return to my original taxonomy of modern-game adoption challenges:<br/>- Escapism (people who play to escape reality, not to be reminded of it)<br/>- Ontology (people who like to assume a whole different worldview, far from modern scientific materialism)<br/>- Projectability (its easier to project really wild shit on an unknown world than the known one)<br/>- Novelty (the new is always more exciting than the old, right?)<br/><br/>I think it's <i>very</i> possible to solve for all of the above within a modern setting, given an interesting milieu and a creative approach.  I think it's just as possible as fantasy, and in fact we've named several and come up with a dozen or more ideas for same, right here in this thread.  <br/><br/>The main difference (I <i>think</i>) is that these modern settings often will not be as <i>broad</i> as an entire <i>world</i>, because many of them will draw their subjective meaning and emotional resonance from the relative separation of the <i>storyscape</i> from the rest of the (real, mundane) world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430016/#Comment_430016" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-26T09:00:38+00:00" title="March 26, 2014  9:00AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha, now I want to write <i>Dogs in the Boondocks</i>. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
