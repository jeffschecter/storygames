As an ever-changing group of people, we've changed a lot about how people perceive games and game design. This has been a positive thing on the whole, and we're all very pleased with having done it. Yay us.<br/><br/>For example, we "democratized" design, which is to say we made design something that any schmo could do, and that also chipped away at the notion that companies and their employees should be giving us fun designs. And, that we should also elevate the status of those people for having done so.<br/><br/>However, there is ALWAYS a tradeoff.<br/><br/>Other things happened in doing so, too.<br/><br/>For one, we created an environment that cherished particular values, and either criticized or felt threated by others. I believe this results in a blinding effect, and probably also an environment where challenging certain things is a no-no.<br/><br/>For example, we cherish innovation. We also cherish the craftsmanship in individuals creating interesting looking publications.<br/><br/>We do not cherish, say, design that does not innovate in the interest of appealing to a wider audience of gamers ("trad" gamers, or whatever you wish to call it -- you get the point). We don't do this, despite the probability that doing so would mean individual publishers would have more sales.<br/><br/><br/>When Keith says democratization is nonsense, I understand what he means. I don't think Jonathan has the same perspective. It's no crime; they're just coming at it from different angles.<br/><br/>I share Keith's perspective on a bunch of these topics above. It's something he and I share and talk about -- things like how limited in business scope we approach things in this community. We haven't talked about it with Jonathan ever, as far as I can recall.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure I also understand what Jonathan means, and why it's good, not nonsense, that we've democratized design.<br/><br/>But, I think we have a situation here in which the community I have been a part of for 10 years is at a point where it's quite happy with the viability, direction, and commercial success of its endeavors. And, I'm wildly disatisfied with that same situation.<br/><br/>So, I read "nonsense" from that perspective. Democratization has been a fantastic thing. It's achieved good.<br/><br/>But, when that good is sort of abstractly compared to the good other things have done in gaming, the scope is painfully small.<br/><br/>This is not to say we accomplished zero. It is to say that our reach and resources have limited things far more than I ever would have guessed back in, say, 2006.<br/><br/>One can pretty easily argue that, say, Organized Play, did good for the hobby in terms of commercial viability, at least. In comparison to the indie scene, that amount of good is "bigger." So are several other things, games, companies, people, etc. And, thus, I wish we could have done more.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to believe, based on my experiences and observations, that our community is apathetic to this in general. That its values and mine diverged about 1-2(?) years ago. I'd love to find out I'm wrong about that, and our values and priorities overlap far more than I suspect currently.<br/><br/>This isn't a "fight" -- hippie games and I simply go in parallel directions or something. That's ok.<br/><br/>And, so, I think these kinds of things are hard to talk about without a pissing match because of the difference in those values and priorities. I'm VERY interested in talking about these priorities and how they differ from what I see in this community (i.e. hippe indie games, not just SG!). Another thread, I think. </blockquote>\nAnd I look at this and say, yeah, we should (and will, I think) continue to push things.  I don't see the lack of will or interest that Matt sees; instead, I see people who are quietly licking their wounds and easing their weariness from previous battles and efforts, preparing themselves for another big push (or, more likely, several big pushes in different directions).<br/><br/>Can we talk specifics, Matt?  What are the next big pushes you would like to see?  I'll think about the ones I want to see in the meantime.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289933/#Comment_289933" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T12:04:52+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 12:04PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt</cite>We do not cherish, say, design that does not innovate in the interest of appealing to a wider audience of gamers ("trad" gamers, or whatever you wish to call it -- you get the point).

In order to sell a trad gamer a game that works better for him than the trad game he already plays it needs some form of innovation. Doing the same things in the same ways won't work (because they haven't yet, so why would they start now?), so you have to do <i>something</i> new. Maybe that means innovating in a different way than most designers have in the past, but it still seems like a form of innovation to me.<br/><br/>I also find it interesting that this community tends to respond to weird design contests with a "woohoo, constraints breed creativity!" mindset, but tends to be suspicious of constraints stemming from trying to make games that customers will want to buy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289943/#Comment_289943" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T12:34:54+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 12:34PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">@Jonathan</a> -- sure, I'll round up some specifics and blather on.

What are the next big pushes you would like to see?</blockquote>\nWhat I would like to see in the affirmative does not imply that the negative should happen. <br/><br/>Specifically, what I'm going to say here doesn't mean people should stop doing whatever the heck they want to do for designing and/or publshing games. I couldn't even begin to stop them even if I did want to do such a stupid thing. I don't.<br/><br/>Ok! So, here are a few things I'd like to see. Some of this I've said before, so I'm going to sound like a broken record to some folks. <br/><br/>First, I'll start with my selfish and immediate wishes. I'd like talented people to help me with Indigo. If you don't know what Indigo is, check out the google group.<br/><br/><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/open-game-design-project" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/open-game-design-project</a><br/><br/>Indigo is me acting on this shift in values and priorities I describe above (the bit Jonathan quoted in the initial post here). I want to take what I (we) learned from the scene over the last 10 or so years and apply it in ways that are more appealing to more gamers.<br/><br/>I want to do that with other designers who've faced similar frustrations as mine. We network together via Indigo. What we lose in specialization of designs we gain in marketing to an existing audiences and sales.<br/><br/>Ok, second, I'd like to see a growth in designers and publishers eager to reach a wider net of gamers beyond the story gamer type crowd. I'm thinking something modest here, not a mass revolution beyond scales we've seen before. The metric I keep repeating is 2,000 sales in 2 years. I picked it as a reasonable number that would represent good success with some effort.<br/><br/>Third (really a facet of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above), I'd like to see designers do less boutique game design and more product design (I don't know what other word to use). So, fewer hyper-specialized games, and more trad-indie hybrids (again, for lack of better terms) with top-notch design and wider appeal.<br/><br/>In essence, I'd like to see indie games have wider appeal <i>among gamers</i>. I say this as opposed to non-gamers, for example, which we've talked about over and over again in 10 years and seen painfully slow, if any, real progress. Certainly no reliable marketing plans for publishers to succeed with.<br/><br/>I should note that I'm not opposed to finding ways to reach non-gamers. I just am skeptical it can be done without some real marketing firepower, like WotC would have, presumably. So, I say abandon what we don't have resources to do and focus resources on more reliable success.<br/><br/>One last point -- I think for this stuff to happen, the nature of designers and publishers and one-man-band operations will shift. Sure, that will always be part of this scene. But, if this happens at all, we'll see changes that probably stray from indie, where indie is defined as "creator owned." <br/><br/>Again, that's a specific value this community shares, and I'm saying it'll be challenged. Not in a big "fuck you" kind of way, but in a natural, "help me" kind of way. Some will maintain creator ownership, others won't.<br/><br/>Ok, Jonathan (and everyone), that's just a smattering of things. I'm sure there's lots more to discuss -- I feel like I haven't really hit on some of the things I've been thinking over, but this is good. I'm sure others have other ideas, too! Discuss away, and I can add anything as it develops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290220/#Comment_290220" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T21:45:44+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  9:45PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>In essence, I'd like to see indie games have wider appeal<i>among gamers</i>.</blockquote>\nThis is a really key point, I think. There are a lot of definitions of "gamer" but for me it's a person who likes using games as a way to have fun, test themselves, and connect with others. <br/><br/>So, of course, there's a huge market for these people, and if you're going to reach them, you have to give them what they're looking for. Lots of us are focused on creating a good story, and that's awesome, but I fear a lot of people are going to be less interested if the game elements aren't strong enough. It would be interesting to discuss why more people are interested in games than in collaborative storytelling, as well as how to get people more interested in it, but that's sort of beside the point of this thread. <br/><br/>The emphasis here is that to succeed with "gamers," we need to think about what kind of social experience we want a game to create more than what kind of story we want it to tell. Chess, Cranium, and Candyland all create different social experiences; all of them resonate with certain groups of people, and create an experience these people want to come back to. Our games will be very different from those, obviously, but we should never forget to pay as much attention to our games' social dynamics as those games' designers did. That's not to say that the story isn't important -- after all it's the story that defines the genre of the "story game" -- but it's important that a story fits inside the game, not a game inside the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290240/#Comment_290240" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T22:33:50+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 10:33PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 10:35PM by Jesse.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>In essence, I'd like to see indie games have wider appeal<i>among gamers</i></blockquote>\nWhy?  I ask that in all sincerity.  I don't get why that matters to you.  I'm even willing to admit that I have a very, very cynical view of wider gamer culture.  I try to imagine something that appeals to an aggregated collection of 2000 *gamer* values and I don't see anything I relate to there.  But YOU must see something there.

I'm just going to take your assertions at face value, because I'm trying to understand your position rather than argue with you.<br/><br/>As far as I know or can guess, there are probably somewhere under a dozen games coming out of the post-Forge community who have met your 2000-in-two-years goal, yeah?  Or, at least, less than a dozen designers who, with a few games under their belt, move at least 1000 copies a year.  Are you suggesting that efforts to replicate that success on a solo designer basis are... not misguided, but maybe not as likely to reach commercial success perhaps as more collaborative efforts?  Is that what's leading you to move in this direction?  I suspect you're right that the autuer approach may not work as well for a lot of designers, but I'm not convinced collaboration is any easier, I guess.  But I'm interested in what leads you down this road.  Does any of it come from the disappointing (to you) response to Nine Worlds or some of your other projects, which you've previously talked about?  I tend to think of Nine Worlds as a product oriented towards the "mainstream gamer," so I'm wondering what a shift more in that direction would look like, in your mind.<br/><br/>Another question: when I look over the games that have achieved substantial commercial success (which, like you say, has mostly been among existing roleplaying audiences), I see some that are clearly "crossover" games with a lot of mainstream appeal (most of the Evil Hat stuff, for example, though not <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>; fighty games with popular genre hooks like <i>Agon</i> or <i>3:16</i>), but then there's also that game about Mormon cowboys, y'know?  Or the one about homoerotic elves at the North Pole.  Are you saying we need to rethink the content of our games to achieve commercial success, or is to more about how the material is presented and marketed towards wider gaming audiences?<br/><br/>Also, appealing to "gamers" is a huge category.  Are you hoping to appeal to existing tabletop roleplayers (which I guess means mostly the D&amp;D and Pathfinder crowd, yeah?) or to the wider gamer-identifying audience that mostly plays Halo and Starcraft and WoW?  If so, do you worry about how you actually get the game in front of them, if they are potentially interested in tabletop games, but not necessarily going to know to look at anything beyond WOTC and maybe Paizo?  If you are aiming at the post-D&amp;D crowd, what can we offer them that's as good or better than what they're getting from WOTC/Paizo?  Does that require full-color, full-sized hardbacks and a push towards higher production values across the board?<br/><br/>Lastly, have you thought about what it means to "give up" the wailing-like-John-the-Baptist-in-the-wilderness part of the independent games movement and attempting to compete with larger roleplaying outfits more directly?  Did we do all this just so we can be the next White Wolf?  Etc.<br/><br/>I'm legitimately interested in your answers to all of these.  None of them are traps in disguise.

I see a vast potential in this activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to talk about what my friends are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://celstyle.com/" rel="nofollow">cel*style</a> within a week (god willing) will have a fully operational online store collecting a few publisher's books. We will have members in attendance at both PAX and kumoricon this weekend to promote. We are a group of publishers that grew up on manga and anime and now we want to bring our games to that audience . The manga audience is ripe for gaming in more ways then one and they are easy to reach with anime cons. We also have an organised play program in the works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for product design I really agree that this is important and neglected.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost rpg's lack playtime, # of players and age range listings. This information is key to both product and game design and it's left out or simply can not be defined because the game lacks the proper structures. I specifically am making a tightly focused rpg that is mostly cards and components, the rule book is rarely used (like a board game rule book) this will not be an expensive box set but something like a 15-30$ "tuck box" card game presentation when it's finished. The game it's self is meant to address many of the reasons people dont play more often (a key way to make a game more accessible)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there is what my friends and i are doing and then there is what fantasy flight and board games are doing. BSG is a very interesting hybrid and has been celebrated for it's play by roleplayers, board gamers and normal people. They also put out warhammer fantasy 3. while i don't think it's super accessible at that price range it's a great step in the right direction. There are more board and card games to list but i would like to play them first. there is actually kind of a story movement in the board game crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I'm not sure if people here really need to value something like that, and thats cool. Story games have kind of come into their own, I mean it's really easy to tell "main stream" and indy games apart on the book shelf (by trim size mostly). and at least in my area most stores have a shelf for both.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as they are i'm not sure Indy games could appeal to more people and I highly doubt indy games want to change. What passes for silly absurd fun at an anime con is seen by the people here as misogyny and a sick evil fetish*. But it's what attracts a ready audience. Also it appears that the moment something is not Indy or is very successful it loses cred. I think what people are working on here is fantastic and could really reach a vast audience. but once it's there would people still own it? is green day still punk rock? I don't care if they are or not but i did like the little bit of their song that was in the commercial for their new album<br/>\n<br/>\n* and thats cool, i don't totally disagree (i'm talking about maid) either way your entitled to your feelings and i wont argue about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso F white wolf, i want to be the next hasbro, or like nintendo but before videogames.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tyler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290272/#Comment_290272" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T02:41:17+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  2:41AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2010 3:44AM by TylerT.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs Wrote<br/>\n"We're talking about commercial values here?

I think it's great to be pushing boundaries, but it's also good to look at existing mechanics, ideas and combinations thereof and refining them into a well oiled machine. A game that has longevity. Basic Role Playing is a perfect example of this - it hasn't changed much in 30 years, and is actually pretty recognisable as D&amp;D (AC stayed the same but switched to damage reduction rather than deflection, and shields are cover, weapon damage is roughly the same, d100 and d20 aren't all that different, etc), but it's also a great game by modern standards. Of all the older games that I've looked at, it's the percentile ones that still look good compared to modern systems - BRP, Millenium's End, FASA Star Trek - there's just something about it, so it also makes perfect sense to just have a straight forward percentile based skill system and put the effort towards an interesting setting. At the same time there's Diaspora which makes brilliant use of FATE and I don't see it being noteworthy even with a percentile system. Both innovation and refinement is necessary, and we've seen plenty of innovation among indie games (but not many that last or still seem innovative a few years later), and we've seen a fair bit of refinement going on with FUDGE, FATE and d20, which are incidentally other examples of the democratisation of design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290348/#Comment_290348" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T08:26:10+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  8:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not that you guys shouldn't stop your own effort, but isn't this already happening?

Walton</cite>As far as I know or can guess, there are probably somewhere under a dozen games coming out of the post-Forge community who have met your 2000-in-two-years goal, yeah? Or, at least, less than a dozen designers who, with a few games under their belt, move at least 1000 copies a year. Are you suggesting that efforts to replicate that success on a solo designer basis are... not misguided, but maybe not as likely to reach commercial success perhaps as more collaborative efforts?</blockquote>\nYes, that's one of the things I'm saying. Going solo is not as likely to hit that kind of number of sales. It's harder to do. Exactly.<br><br>Note that I am NOT saying "And, therefore, anyone who remains a solo creator-owned publisher is stupid." <br><br>That's still a valid choice and highly workable and rewarding. This is even more true as one's goals are smaller in scope (which is just part of my argument's logic here -- it's easier to succeed when your number of sales goal is lower, duh).<br><br>\n<blockquote><br>Is that what's leading you to move in this direction? I suspect you're right that the autuer approach may not work as well for a lot of designers, but I'm not convinced collaboration is any easier, I guess. But I'm interested in what leads you down this road. Does any of it come from the disappointing (to you) response to Nine Worlds or some of your other projects, which you've previously talked about? I tend to think of Nine Worlds as a product oriented towards the "mainstream gamer," so I'm wondering what a shift more in that direction would look like, in your mind.<br/></br></blockquote>\nI'm not convinced collaboration is any easier, either. I've tried it at least 3 times over the years in serious efforts. All failed out of the starting block, some in giant flames of social mess.<br><br>As for my success and failures, yes, of course they color my thinking on this. Unavoidable. <br><br>I definitely don't think Nine Worlds is a mainstream-gamer oriented game. It's a hard core story game with lots of turn-offs for mainstreamers, which I've heard first-hand (and second hand) many times. Now, the <i>setting</i> might be more what you're talking about. But, not as it stands.<br><br>And, I think this question: \n<blockquote>I'm wondering what a shift more in that direction would look like, in your mind.</blockquote>\ndeservers its own full reply, possibly its own thread. I'll tackle it later on.<br><br>For now, I'll just say that I think what I've written about Indigo (Google group and on my blog) answers in conceptual fashion. I'd probably need to have an actual game to point to! So, instead I'll mention a few likely suspects: Dresden Files, Apocalypse World, Burning Wheel. I cop to knowing only Burning Wheel reasonably well.<br><br>\n<blockquote><br>Another question: when I look over the games that have achieved substantial commercial success (which, like you say, has mostly been among existing roleplaying audiences), I see some that are clearly "crossover" games with a lot of mainstream appeal (most of the Evil Hat stuff, for example, though not Don't Rest Your Head; fighty games with popular genre hooks like Agon or 3:16), but then there's also that game about Mormon cowboys, y'know? Or the one about homoerotic elves at the North Pole. Are you saying we need to rethink the content of our games to achieve commercial success, or is to more about how the material is presented and marketed towards wider gaming audiences?<br/></br></blockquote>\nUnsuprisingly, I think both. <br><br>Now, it's probably non-controversial to say that how the material is marketing needs rethinking to reach larger audiences. It's kind of a no-brainer. So much so for me, anyway, that I don't see what's to discuss about it. Yep, publishers change how they market such-and-such games to have wider appeal. Ok.<br><br>But, the real tough stuff happens in rethinking content of the games. That's where you really hit a designer in the gut, like so: "Well, look, designer, you <i>can</i> succeed selling a cool game about 1960s ad executives, but it's about one quintillion times harder than succeeding with a cool game about space marines."<br><br>Now, people are quick to point out examples like yours. How does Vincent succeed with games about Mormon kids? I don't fucking know. I'm not Vincent Baker. Neither is anyone else! Since we can't be him, or a small handful of other folks who are fucking design geniuses, then we (again) have to work much harder to create games with, well, let's call it unconventional content. Despite this fact, this community falls all over itself to get excited about such unusual games (good), but I detect apathy at best outside the community (not as good).<br><br>I think this is simply a matter of demand. How much harder does a publisher have to work to convince people to buy and play a game if the content isn't something they're very interested in, despite the fact that the game's really clever and well designed?  And, getting that buyers' game group to play that game?<br><br>And, my answer is, one hell of a lot harder. As in: Either put in a lot more of your time (which I personally don't have), or settle for the fact that you will sell fewer copies. Which is, by and large, what we've done because this community values individual creativity and designer vision far more than it values copies sold, for example (among other priorities, too). Again, as I keep saying, that priority is fine. I'm saying there are other paths, but that's a fine path to walk if you prefer it.<br><br>(cont'd)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290430/#Comment_290430" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T11:00:26+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 11:00AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br>Also, appealing to "gamers" is a huge category. Are you hoping to appeal to existing tabletop roleplayers (which I guess means mostly the D&amp;D and Pathfinder crowd, yeah?) or to the wider gamer-identifying audience that mostly plays Halo and Starcraft and WoW?<br/></br></blockquote>\nDamn. I knew me using the term "gamer" was bound to cause confusion. I should have been more precise. <br><br>First, no to computer gamers. Keith's been riding my ass about this, but fuck 'em. He thinks there's big promise in the computer game scenes. I agree in general, just don't think I can do much about it. Too few resources. But, yeah, awesome idea.<br><br>Second, yes, existing tabletop role-players, but not really the all-Pathfinder, all-the-time groups. They've got what they like. And, again, I lack the resources to market to them. <br><br>Really, my goals are for that squishy middle (actually, more like that squishy 15-20% or something since D&amp;D / Pathfinder / etc have so much of the market)  -- somewhere between only-D&amp;D players and only-indie players. Those are the folks I'd like to reach. Folks who like traditional RPG content and experiences, but who would like to see some new quality stuff, too. They <i>may</i> be disintereted in or even dislike those "weird" indie games.<br><br>Two quick points: <br><br>1) Other folks COULD reach both hard core D&amp;D folks and/or computer gamers. I'm just saying not me and my goals.<br><br>2) I assume in all cases thatmany hippe indie folks will still buy such games.\n<blockquote><br/>If you are aiming at the post-D&amp;D crowd, what can we offer them that's as good or better than what they're getting from WOTC/Paizo? Does that require full-color, full-sized hardbacks and a push towards higher production values across the board?<br/></blockquote>\nWhat we can offer folks are services more than products, though it may not look like it at a glance -- ways to make playing require much, much less prep, and far less rules mastery and heft. Provide content and games of the kind they used to love (and still do), but do it in a way that caters to their more grown up and busy lifestyle to help them get to playing quicker &amp; easier.<br/><br/>Second, production would have to be really slick, but not necessarily match or beat the high caliber production of WotC, etc. Nice art, color covers, good interior B&amp;W design, softback, would all be totally sufficient. Going up from there even better. (shrug)<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>Lastly, have you thought about what it means to "give up" the wailing-like-John-the-Baptist-in-the-wilderness part of the independent games movement and attempting to compete with larger roleplaying outfits more directly? Did we do all this just so we can be the next White Wolf? Etc.<br/></blockquote>\nHaven't thought about it. My John-the-Baptist days didn't get me very far. Sure as hell not where I wanted to be, anyway. It's not something I have any interest in much anymore. I'm not much of an idealogue these days. The amount of time I can devote to RPGs is far, far too scant for me to get religion like that anymore. It usually brought me more stress than happiness. I'd rather have fun.<br/><br/>I have no idea if we did this to be White Wolf. Not sure what else to say. <br/><br/>If anything (and this is a big stretch) I did this just so I can become the next Dark Horse Comics, so to speak. That's the only real-world entity I thought of aspiring to in any way when thinking about this stuff. Of course, it's really a pipe dream, but just something cool that motivated me.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290452/#Comment_290452" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T11:47:13+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 11:47AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick hear-hear to Graham's point.

It's inevitable. <br/><br/>I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290458/#Comment_290458" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T11:52:38+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 11:52AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>Is this purely a business-side motive?<br/><br/>Because all my thoughts on this are coming purely from a play side.

I just want to be contrary and make the following two points. I'm not saying Matt's a bad person for wanting to reach a more mainstream audience, mind.<br/><br/>1) I kind of view indie game publishing as being pretty analogous to fine art in that there are always going to be two different creative impulses that drive creators. Some creators think that reaching as wide an audience as possible is the most important goal to reach for and will try to make sure that their works have a broad appeal. Other creators are motivated to push the boundary of the artform itself and aren't bothered by the fact that the resulting product might be very limited in its appeal as long as their audience is a non-zero number of people. And here's the thing, I don't think that either impulse is wrong. The first type of creator brings new people into the audience. The second type of creator ensures that the artform doesn't lose that audience through complacency and stagnation.<br/><br/>2) I feel like there's a lot of data out there about how to write games that will appeal to the "mainstream" of gamers, and that's great. If your goal is to help more indie games go after that model, that's great. But I also feel like there's a lot we DON'T know about how to appeal to an audience that we'd like to get but don't know how to target. We know a lot about marketing games to nerdy white straight men, but we don't know a whole lot about marketing games to people outside that group. I think there's a lot of money to be made if someone can crack that nut, but I have an entirely uneducated gut feeling that smaller-scale operations are going to teach us more on that front than the large-scale ones like Evil Hat, the BW guys, or others.<br/><br/>None of this is trying to say OMG MATT SNYDER YOU ARE AN EVIL SELLOUT. Cause I'm not! I just want to throw some reasons out for why we might not want to totally kill the indie model as it stands currently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290488/#Comment_290488" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T12:42:51+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 12:42PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2010 12:46PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Matt:</b> Cool.  I've changed the title of the thread to better reflect the direction the discussion is going.  I figure I'll post my larger goals in another thread at this point rather than derail or compete with your ideas here.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think everything you're saying makes sense if that's what you want to do.  No argument from me if you want to take aim at that audience.  Part of me wants to say something like "Hasn't that been what many folks have been doing all along?"  But, really, that's neither here nor there.  If you feel like this is something new and different for you, then that's awesome and I think you should go for it.  I feel like, for many folks, myself included, when you strike out for something new and exciting, there's a need to break away from what's gone before, even if it's not really so different.  I think that can be hard for folks to hear, since you're phrasing it in terms of what you feel the existing community is failing to do -- since some people may rightly feel that they've been doing that for a while (Jake Richmond, for instance, or Vincent, Ben, Gregor, Nathan, etc.) -- but I think if that helps you clarify what you think the community is missing out on and how you can make things better, then power to you.  I don't mean that in a condescending way and I hope it doesn't come off like that.  I'm just trying to be honest that I don't necessarily think this is an entirely new direction for indie game design as a whole, even if you feel like this emphasis seems new and fresh to you.  Is that fair?  You're trying to say that newness and innovation don't particularly matter to you, so I hope that doesn't bother you.<br/><br/>I think I also disagree with your assessment that the post-Forge community values innovation over sales (I think the awkward rift with Evil Hat isn't really about that, for example, but more about Evil Hat not being especially enthusiastic about claiming kinship with the Forge or SG and the sense, mistaken or not, that the success of SOTC pushed IPR away from what its original mission).  In general, I think the games you hear about over and over and the ones that see a lot of play are the ones with really decent sales.  In any event, though, it seems like you're trying to get away from identity politics, which sounds good to me.<br/><br/>All in all, however you assess the past 10 years, I think <b>the far more important thing is what you are motivated to do in response</b>, so I'm really interested to hear what you think will be a successful design direction to pursue to achieve the kind of creative and commercial success you're talking about.  To follow along with Jesse's comments, I assume you're also interested in designing "crossover" games rather than "weird" games because those are the ones you enjoy designing and playing more.  So, when you get a chance, I'd love to hear more about the design work that makes you happy and excited about games, rather than having mixed feelings about the direction the community has been going recently.  Personally, I'm super excited by stuff like Apocalypse World, Freemarket, Montsegur 1244, The Adventure Burner, How to Host a Dungeon, Mouse Guard, and a bunch of other recent games, so I don't feel particularly dissatisfied with how things are going, but it's 100% cool if you're not in the same place, <b>especially if it leads you to design new games that are both awesome in and of themselves and make you happier.</b>  I don't know how anyone could be less than excited about that.<br/><br/>So yeah.  Rock on.  I can't wait to see where this takes you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290522/#Comment_290522" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T13:31:21+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  1:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, if the dude that did Nine Worlds and Dust Devils wants to do a game that plays differently from those two games, I'll absolutely give it a shot, given the quality of those previous games.

Most of us involved with the event were story gamers (as in forum goers), but I brought two friends who are hardcore D&amp;D/Exalted/etc people and barely know anything about the indie scene. They had a blast, and now my entire game group from the days of yore (again, people who play D&amp;D and White Wolf games exclusively, aside from the occasional foray into obscure territory, like Whispering Vault)... are playing Apocalypse World with me and loving it! During my last session, we had ANOTHER friend who had no conception of the indie scene observe and she was totally into it--now she wants to play!<br/><br/>Back to South Bay SG Day anecdotes: we had a few wargamers and random customers stop in and watch us, and one guy observing the Mouse Guard table was freaking AMAZED by the play we were generating. "Are you guys, like, a regular group?" "No, we mostly just met." "Whoa..."<br/><br/>So basically my entire gaming group (8+ people divided into two groups that play Friday/Satuday, with every few meetings being a massive boardgame fest or a zany one-shot with eight people) now has eyes on these fora and are checking out the Forge and telling everyone they game with how rad some of these small print games are.<br/><br/>My current gaming group underwent a massive change in taste as well, when me and my housemate started offering Spirit of the Century, Lacuna, Mouse Guard, and Lady Blackbird (as well as some OSR gaming). Now everyone wants to play as many games as they can, just so they can be "well read". Let me tell you, in my experience the term "well read" does not exist among traditional crowds (I regret the use of that term, but bear with me). Most people in my sphere of perception never pick up a book just to read it or play it once and add it to their bag of tricks, and not for purely financial reasons (these guys have more money than they know what to do with).<br/><br/>Anyway, I've noticed in recent years that story gaming has become something of a virus or a meme. People are getting exposed to a single game by an excited facilitator and all of a sudden they're on Story Games at 4a trying to find a copy of Lacuna so they can run it a few times before hacking it to play Inception-type stories (truth: I had this discussion with a guy last night and he is buying a copy as soon as he can).<br/><br/>I think I've gotten off-topic here, but bear with me. I agree with Graham--we need new people, but I think we here at Story Games and the Forge and Barf Forth and the un-store and IPR and etc can totally bring new blood into the fold. I got into story gaming two and a half years ago, and in that period of time I've seen every group I've ever played with add at LEAST one story game to their roster and usually we start playing a bajillion story-games before going back to say, Exalted with new eyes and runing it using, say, the Mortal Coil facts system coupled with the GM advice, agenda, and principles found in Apocalypse World (modified to suit the genre, of course). Hell, every game I run (Edit: okay, well, not EVERY game) now has Burning Wheel-style BITs that generate extra XP, and I'm trying to fit Keys into White Wolf games to see what happens (gain an XP when you hit your key).<br/><br/>Apologies if this is just off-the-deep-end irrelevant. I got really excited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290544/#Comment_290544" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T13:58:22+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  1:58PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think targetting the CRPG market is actually a really good idea. For instance Persona 3 focuses on building social links to increase the powers of your personas. That's pretty awesome as is, but you realise that you're usually following through dialog trees to develop those links, and just committing your time (a limited resource) into developing them, but not actually having to really develop them. There's clearly a market there of people who would like to get something more out of their experience. Final Fantasy is the big juggernaut, but Persona is the runner up, and Persona 5 and Catherine have the potential to outdo Final Fantasy Versus 13 given how interest for the former is waxing and the latter is waning. That market there, bridging traditional RPG mechanics (combat and leveling up is familiar) with indie RPG mechanics (strength by social relationships, and you get stronger because of who you know, how well you know them and how much they confide in you) is ripe for getting a split between traditional and indie gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290563/#Comment_290563" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T14:23:31+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  2:23PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>mostly won't be interested in this effort</blockquote>\nI think you're probably wrong, but we'll see.

Jesse, this is going to be a hard reply. Hard to you, that is. I'm likely going to challenge your ideals, and probably not satisfy you bafflement in the process.<br/><br/>Yes, I think you have a cynical view. I understand why. I once shared many similar views about the hobby. I probably even still do share some. But, I'm fully aware I've shed or changed many (most?) of those.<br/><br/>I do find things to relate to in the hobby outside indie/story games. The games, especially, but also the people. Oh, not all games, and not everyone in the hobby. But, there's plenty to admire. In fact, I think it's plausible I relate to non-indie folks in more sincere and important ways than indie gamers. My own game group, first and foremost. They fit the mold rather well of that "squishy 15-20% rather well. I know them better than I know nearly everyone in the design scene.<br/><br/>There's nastier problem. I find some things in the indie game scene not appealing at all. Jonathan hit it briefly earlier -- there's quite a lot of idenity politics and similar ideological and political nonsense. That's not unique to this scene, of course. All scenes have that. But, there are things that drive me nuts in the scene, sure.<br/><br/>One of the things that drives me nuts is this idea that there's a line one crosses metaphorically, as though one's saved from the awfulness outside indie games. When you ask me "is evoking value and perspective change not part of your agenda at all," I cringe. <br/><br/>No. It's not part of my agenda. At least, not in the way I'm pretty sure you mean it. I find that idea poisonous these days. <br/><br/>There's this thing about this scene where we use language that should alarm a skeptical humanist like me. Like, "Hey, guys, I just converted my friends to indie games! Isn't that great!" Or, "Indie games really saved me from abandoning RPGs altogether."<br/><br/>That stuff is really off-putting to me, for a few reasons. First of all, it smacks of some kind of us or them idenity. Either your a trad gamer, or you have been converted to the goodness of indie games. <i>Converted</i>?!? Really? <br/><br/>Then, there's the inevitable, if subtle, shaming for "slumming" it with regular games. "Well, we played Mutants &amp; Masterminds ... but, it's ok! We used conflict resolution!" As though individuals should have to feel embarassed or bad in any way for not being indie enough. (Jess, this happens. I don't know or care whether you think of it that way. I've observed it. I've <i>participated</i> in it.) <br/><br/>It's utterly strange to me now, and I regret I didn't think this years ealier. I might have had a stronger voice is saying the scene should absolutely not happen in such divisive ways with such departmentalized language. After all, indie meant creator ownership; it was silent on whether one "should" play JAGS or Dogs.

Yes. I can. But, then again, I'm not clear what game we're talking about, either. I enjoy Sorcerer. I enjoy Nine Worlds. I also enjoy Pathfinder, and I've been known to play and have a fine time with, oh, Shadowrun or whatever other thing. Yes, I can absolutely enjoy these things. I don't enjoy every game. I find flaws in nearly every single game I've ever played (the curse of the designer, I think). But, I don't like the idea that there is a discrete area over which one finds the "good" games and prior to which one finds the "bad" games.<br/><br/>Even if that were true, I'd still want to do what I'm describing to demonstrate that all this good stuff we've developed over 10 or so years, all these great techniques and theory and thinking and design can absolutely be applied to games different than what we have come to recognize and expect from indie games. That these great ideas can apply to mostly "traditional" games about space marines, and that such games don't have to look like 3:16 at all to be wildly fun and appealing to many people.<br/><br/>Let me close this reply with this: <br/><br/>I have been working on this stuff for over a year. I've been doing a lot of thinking and talking with a few folks, a good deal of writing, and a little bit of designing in this direction. Until this thread (and its preceding thread), I did not want to share this stuff directly on Story Games. It was a conscious decision. I avoided this because I was (am) convinced that my friends and colleagues would find it challenging, baffling, perhaps even offensive. And, thus, I'd have to spend time <i>justifying</i> myself, which is exactly one of the things that the creator-owned movement set out to dismantle, that designers had to justify their choices to whatever powers that be. Well, here I am justifying. You can imagine my own bafflement.<br/><br/>Similarly, I previously haven't tried to recruit friends and fellow designers here for Indigo because people would think it either a fool's errand (which indeed it may be, I admit) or -- more importantly -- contrary to the spirit of their hobby. And, that's really a shame, because here is where most of my friends read things and where some of the best design talent hangs out.<br/><br/>The good news is that there's still lots to discuss, and the even better news is that there are still fantastic games to create.<br/><br/>P.S. Oh! By the way, even given all the bafflement and questions, I cannot makes sense out of why you'd doubt that Nine Worlds was fun for me, or that I'd not want to play such games anymore. Whether I <i>publish</i> Space Marines R Us really has nothing to say on whether I like to <i>play</i> Nine Worlds or anything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290887/#Comment_290887" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T11:28:17+00:00" title="September  1, 2010 11:28AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Not that you guys shouldn't stop your own effort, but isn't this already happening?</blockquote>\nYep, it sure is.

Sure, I don't think most of the folks who came to indie games via the Forge want to write/publish something like Exalted or Vampire, though there are some exceptions I could think of (Shreyas is really into gear-head mechanical complexity, for example, but hasn't had a space to scratch that itch yet).  But yeah, the indie design community, overall, doesn't provide a lot of support for that kind of design work (not that it provides great design support very often nowadays, but that's another issue).<br/><br/>You shouldn't feel like you need to justify yourself to me at least.  I'm just asking questions trying to understand and definitely think you should do whatever makes you happy.  Fuck everything else.

A game is a game. There is a lot we can learn from traditional games and communities. Just because you like something different doesn't mean the way someone else plays sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You don't want to "convert" people to a style of gaming. You don't want a political movement. You just want to make good games.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You used to think de-geekifying games might attract a wider audience. Your current thinking is to embrace our inner geek.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The design community that came out of the Forge seemed insular. In the early 2000s, they were mainly buying each others games. Which is fine but people burn out very fast buying 20 other community member's games and end up only playing 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The "system matters" philosophy appeals to you and you like tight game mechanics. But that doesn't mean the content (setting, fiction) has to simultaneously be limiting.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You want to bring the "systems matters" approach to content that appeals to a wider audience (dungeon crawls, heroic combat, cthulhu horror, war, superheroes, ninjas, pirates, zombies, robots, monkeys, vampires).<br/>\n<br/>\n- But when you say wider audience, you don't mean mainstream people who have never roleplayed. It may be possible to do that but none of us have the resources to try. Instead you want to widen the appeal to existing gamers outside of this community (players of D&amp;D;, Pathfinder, Warhammer, Dark Heresey, White Wolf, Shadowrun, Hero, Mutants &amp; Masterminds).<br/>\n<br/>\n- You recognize that some people connected to this community have already done this. Dresden Files and Smallville for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You also want to make games that are products designed for specific audiences. You also design games as art projects where the audiences is you. Both those approaches are great.<br/>\n<br/>\n- But you feel this community sometimes looks down on and misunderstands business, marketing, and money.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You just want people to be honest about their goals and not be hostile towards people who have different goals. Are you working on an art project... great!

Could this be one of the games that really works for everyone and crosses the "us/them" divide?<br><br>I'd also like to hear what you think about other games which have worked to bridge the gap, such as Dresden Files and Smallville. In your podcast you mentioned these, and said they were fine, and someone said that the Fate system isn't his thing in particular (I couldn't tell if it was you or Keith), but I'd like to hear more detailed ideas about the systems of all these games, what aspects appeal to traditional gamers and what might not. I'm not looking for a judgment or prediction of the future here, just trying to see what the key elements are, so that we can learn from them.<br><br>Also, these things tend to make me think that you're not going against the grain of this community, so much as you are putting into words the next natural stage of its progression. Growing is painful sometimes, but I think it's happening. If you'll bear with me, I have an analogy (and I'm a new father, which is what makes me think of it): There is stage of intense creativity in any living thing, when that organism separates from other organisms in a kind of womb, and then another stage when it is born and rejoins the larger community as a new member, with all its new organs healthy and ready to go. It could be that the insights of the indie community are finally ready to be born into the larger world of gaming and roleplaying, in the form of new games designed to merge the best of both worlds. But before, they just weren't there yet -- now they are. It's not a group of people and their identity politics that kept indie designers and their games separate (or at least, it's not only that), it's the ideas they were working on needing time to form into complete, workable game elements that everyone in the mainstream community could begin to appreciate.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291954/#Comment_291954" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T10:07:32+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 10:07AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt has been a big influence on my design ever since he handed me an ashcan of 44 at GenCon one year.

That's at least 10 months behind the time I wanted to have this conversation. I deliberately avoided this specific community for those kinds of reasons -- the identity stuff, etc. So, really, one of your questions is "why did you avoid SG, and then decide to do it anyway?" <br/><br/>The answer is two-fold: First, I wanted to nip the Clyde interview in the bud. Clyde asked me to interview at least 6 months ago. We finally did it at GenCon. And, I expected his audience to overlap considerably with this audience. I wanted to be proactive and talk about my thoughts before the identity politics waded in and became an exercise in dismissal. Second, after GenCon, I got more motivated to find folks for Indigo. This was my go to place in part because I hadn't tapped it yet and in part because I know who hangs out here, and they're talented folks I'd like to work with, even if in small ways only.<br/><br/>Oh, and third, because Jonathan asked me to (although he was picking that up my earlier comments, too). So, of course!<br/>But, not on to your revised question, which was: \n<blockquote>Why ONLY here?</blockquote>\nTo which I have to scratch my head a bit. Oh, I get it. I mean, I'm not having the conversation over on RPG.net, right? Or the Forge, or any other handful of places. Well, I'm face-to-face friends with many people here, and "Internet friends" with many more. It's in my comfort zone. Again, one of the things I'm most interested in the near term in is finding collaborators for Indigo. Rightly or wrongly, I'm not confident I'll find reliable people over at RPG.net, etc.<br/><br/>But, at the same time, of course I'm not ONLY having this conversation here. I'm having it on my blog quite a bit since about January or so. A couple times on the phone. A few times in email. A bunch at GenCon in person. Certainly, it's related to discussion on my Indigo project.<br/>So, why are you ONLY having it here? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><br/><b>EDIT:</b> And, well, DUH!

Excellent job by Clyde once again of bringing people together and letting them really speak.<br/><br/>Here is what is driving me crazy and making me want to keep interrupting the podcast: <br/><br/>All those games that you want to come out of the storygame scene to appeal to a wider base already exist!  This is already happening!  You are critiquing the scene here (and validly I do agree) that it is too insular and inward-looking but you yourself seem woefully unaware of the rising tide of independently-designed games that are doing well and reflect interesting new evolutions in game design: Barbarians of Lemuria, BASH, Diaspora, Atomic Highway to name some of the more successful ones.  These games are selling!<br/><br/>Furthermore, generic systems with setting flexibility are slowly taking root, growing player bases as well flexible or open licenses that are encouraging design:  FATE and Savage Worlds are the two big boys on the block and they are doing well, especially Savage Worlds (probably because it is being actively nurtured by a single organism as opposed to FATE's more organic growth) but ORE is coming on very strong.  The Supers setting is on fire right now (Supers! BASH, Icons, Smallville, DC Heroes, to name a few), both design wise and sales and we are starting to see setting material customized from system to system.<br/><br/>You say you have a marketing background.  Then I think you would agree that it is a good idea to do your background research on the market you intend to get into.<br/><br/>This is what drives me nuts about this community (and really about gamers in general) is the seeming refusal to look at anything that isn't already pre-sanctioned either by a big corporation or the social hierarchy.   With the RPGA people in my community, if it isn't produced by Wizards, they don't want to hear about it.  Here, it often feels like if it isn't connected to some cool, established guy in the community or if it doesn't pass some litmus test of game design dogmas, then you don't want to hear about it.  <br/><br/>It strikes me as terribly ironic but also terribly telling that the one guy who has some stature who is toying with ideas of expanding outwards also seems blisfully ignorant of what is already out there, exactly where he wants to go.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to say that you shouldn't follow up on this project.  But you need to look at what is already being done in order to develop your strategy.  You want the storygames community to reach farther out?  How about Savaging Cold City?  (To "Savage" something is the term Savage Worlds fans use when a setting gets remade using that ruleset.)  Make an ORE version of Misspent Youth.  I'm just throwing stuff out there, but the point is you reach an audience that is open to diverse rulesets and setting material but for the most part is not touched by the storygames movement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291969/#Comment_291969" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T10:32:11+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 10:32AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">@Kayfall</a> (David)<br/><br/>What I think of Apocalypse World: While time and experience may prove otherwise, right now I'd say it's the best creator-owned RPG released in 4-5 years. Really, obscenely fucking good.<br/><br/>Yes, I think it may indeed be one of those "cross the divide" type games. I point to hacks already rising up as one shred of evidence (rather than the more usual indie path of creating an inspired-by-but-really-unique game). It has that hint of a game people will really tinker with, which I think it a sign it's going to have bigger success than anyone (including Vincent) would have guessed at first.<br/><br/>Oh, and I have a funny story about it. So, at GenCon during a slow period, Ron Edwards and I sat down with Vincent (we were all manning boths in the same spot) for a demo with Vincent. And, so, we're looking over our sheets as we create characters and chatting with Vincent. He gets interrupted a couple times, so Ron and I read the sheets and talk. Vincent sits down again, and Ron and I almost simultaneously say something like: <br/><br/>"What the <i>hell</i>, Vincent? You went and made yourself a 'real' game, didn't you?!?"<br/><br/>And, Vincent just chuckles, being full in on the compliment-disguised-as-a-joke.<br/><br/><br/>Ok, now you also asked about Dresden Files and Smallville. I'm pretty much going on what I <i>hear</i> about these games, rather than first-hand knowledge of or experience with. <br/><br/>I quickly dismissed Smallville when I heard about it, thinking it would be like its predecessors Serenity and Battlestar Galactica. Both of those are shows I love, and games that make me cringe. Smallville, I figured, was a show I couldn't care less about (but fans would) and presumed a system I'd hate. I'm hearing I'm wrong about that. That it has neat relationship elements, good play advice, and surely much  more. So, neat!<br/><br/>As for Dresden Files, I know a tad more about it because I know FATE better, and paid at least some attention to the news about the game in pre-release build-up. It's a mammoth game, and an interesting license. I think it'll do extremely well, while still doing some really interesting game rules thingies. I think Aspects are, of course, the bread and butter of what makes these FATE games rock. They do really interesting things in a very simple way that I think non-hippie-indie gamers can get used to and have fun with right away.<br/><br/>But, that said, my understanding is that Dresden in particular is such a massive expansion of cool shit you can do with the engine that I'm probably vastly oversimplifying it all. Oh! One more thing I have gleaned from reading about it -- I think people will hack the hell out of the game to run all kinds of funky stuff. The introduction of hardcore magic stuff in the regular FATE engine probably opens up all kinds of "campaign" fun (I dunno, how about a Hellboy inspired game Or, Mage: the Ascension "done right" for two I'd like?), or  for many gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291972/#Comment_291972" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T10:37:17+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 10:37AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am answered, with a single exception...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Because this site is the only place on the internet that has people that<b><i>might actually give a shit</i></b>about this project: Interested in what it produces, interested in how it goes, etc.</blockquote>\nI don't think that this is true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291979/#Comment_291979" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T10:42:21+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 10:42AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WakerP, please don't assume I'm ignorant because I didn't mention such games.

How does, say, Indigo fit into the universe where these things exist. So, yes.<br/><br/>Are you asking me if these are competitors?  How I plan to reckon with them, being bigger fish? Just asking that I know Icons exists?

I've stopped seeing other companies and games as the competition and more as other choices for play. I know people who buy anything that comes out that interests them, but they don't necessarily play those games. RPGs are in this odd bucket where actually playing the game isn't what generates the income, as opposed to, say, subscription model online games, and many are good reading material without even being played.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don't know how to place that POV into this discussion other than to say, as a member of a community of design, I'm always into promoting other people's games when I think they're good, and I never feel this is undercutting what I design, personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292037/#Comment_292037" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T12:41:23+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 12:41PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just generally interested in your strategy as I think your goals are worthy.

Indigo from scratch rather than starting with one of the "crossover" systems that is already gaining traction with mainstream gamers, like FATE or Burning Wheel?<br/><br/>Also, when you were talking about only WOTC having the resources to market to people outside of existing gamers, that sounded a lot like "marketing = advertising" thinking to me.

Compete by distributing costs and time across a crew of cooperating guys and gals.<br/><br/>2) Create products oriented toward the lifestyle of maturing gamers. I pulled together a rough list of what "Gamer X" would be like as follows: <br/><br/><b>EDIT:</b> After posting, I realized it's not obvious how this addresses your question. To bring that back 'round, the list below is meant to put Indigo in a position where is remedies the real-life needs of gamers. It doesn't, for example, try to scratch that nostalgia itch. Rather, my vision is that the games are thought of as a service more so than a product -- that they help people with busy, grown-up lives get back to the fun of gaming again in a simpler, more time-appreciative way. \n<blockquote><br/><br/>The idea I have in mind for this audience will shift as this develops, no doubt. But, it\u2019s still worth examining. Here\u2019s a \u201cpersona\u201d I have in mind (who is male here, but could be female, of course):<br/><br/>    * He\u2019s as an existing gamer. He\u2019s around 30+ years old, and has been playing different RPGs for a while. He\u2019s not a hard core, D&amp;D only person.<br/>    * He works full time, and maybe has a family or active social life with a significant other. He\u2019s busy! He needs a game that fits those constraints in his life.<br/>    * His game group is also busy, and they have similar needs!<br/>    * He\u2019s either the frequent game master, or an early adopter of new games \u2014 the guy who has a ton of games on his shelf.<br/>    * His group isn\u2019t as interested in early adoption and new games. He has to convince them to try new games, sometimes unsuccessfully. They may even voice reluctance for \u201cthose indie games.\u201d<br/>    * He\u2019s interested in character driven play. But, he still wants enough \u201cfiddly bits\u201d to make play interesting, too.<br/>    * He\u2019s creative! He\u2019s has lots of cool ideas, and needs a good solution for those ideas.<br/>    * He has a fondness, even nostalgia, for a few particular RPGs. And, he\u2019s a bit disappointed that he now realizes so many of those games have disappointing rules, but exceptionally cool ideas. Or, maybe someone in his groups hates the game he loves. These games he loves have great settings or back stories or other components. He wants to run the settings \u201cin another system,\u201d but he can\u2019t find the right one.<br/>    * He\u2019s not interested in distinctions between \u201cindie\u201d games and \u201ctraditional\u201d games. They are just RPGs. He just wants to enjoy games.<br/><br/><br/></blockquote>\nOthers on the Google group and on my blog contributed more good ideas to add to this list. For example, Jenskot posted these: \n<blockquote>This demographic may also:<br/><br/>- Schedule game night like a poker or movie night with friends, often on a weeknight for 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>- Play more board / card games (even though their friends reminisce about playing RPGs) because they are easier.<br/><br/>- Are computer savvy, with broadband internet, and many but not all have smart phones.<br/><br/>- Have some level of college education.<br/><br/>- Consume other genre media like comics and fantasy or scifi novels.<br/><br/>- Work in a creative field, have dreams of doing so, or have creative hobbies.<br/><br/>- Love socializing with similar people.</blockquote>\n<br/><a href="/forums/profile/Dan">@Dan</a><br/><br/>Dan, it's a very good question, and you're not the first to ask. My answer for now is that existing systems either had components (e.g. fudge dice) that I consider obstacles, or that they do things that do not accomplish what I want to see. But, it's a valid point; it's certainly harder to succeed from scratch than from, say, a FATE base.<br/><br/>As for WotC having resources sounding like "only advertising" I don't know what to tell you. Chalk it up to thinking on my feet. I was thinking at the time of WotC's noticable campaign of pumping up the Dark Sun D&amp;D Encounters. For one, I noticed banner ads at non-rpg sites I visit (like the blog www.geekologie.com). <br/><br/>D&amp;D Encounters appears to me a marketing program, plain and simple. I think its aim to make D&amp;D feel simpler and more accessible to people, with low investment (no cost, only a couple hours) to get them hooked. So, the costs for setting up such a program in participating game stores across the U.S. is non-trivial. There's direct mailing, materials for play (which I assume had no cost for stores, and certainly none for players), posters and other in-store placements, site registration and so on. I imagine that only a handful of publishers could must such resources of time, distribution and money (I dunno, maybe White Wolf, AEG, those kind of crews).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292088/#Comment_292088" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T15:44:32+00:00" title="September  7, 2010  3:44PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2010 3:46PM by J_Walton.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Matt:</b> Nathan and I were chatting about this thread and wondering if what you wanted was a "hardcore NAR," setting-agnostic system that had the mainstream attention and commercial success of Fate or Savage Worlds?  Is that reading you right?  Fate has some "hard choices, passionate characters" bits, sure, but the Fudge dice and the overall focus of the system may not make it quite what you're hoping for.  Personally, I think that Apocalypse World is _almost_ something like that, especially with the chapter on hacking it in the back, but it would be cool to have other options.  Mouse Guard is also pretty close, but hacking it takes a bit more thought and energy, since it's not really laid out for you.<br/><br/>EDIT: And, of course, neither of those have the success among mainstream roleplayers that you're talking about, at least, at present.

Different types of marketing, like creating a remarkable product (in the Seth Godin sense of the word), or creating games that are more likely to spread (say, designing a game whose play results in some cool, tangible thing that the players would want to share with their non-gamer friends) don't necessarily require monetary resources.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292121/#Comment_292121" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T18:50:16+00:00" title="September  7, 2010  6:50PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys, if you wanted to know how to appeal to mainstream gamers, you could have just asked me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292122/#Comment_292122" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T19:13:27+00:00" title="September  7, 2010  7:13PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for taking the time to explain, Matt.

I'm a little confused. Are you genuinely asking about what marketing is? Are you trying to see what I know? In any case, I suspect this is the wrong place -- certainly the wrong thread -- for explaining what marketing is broadly. I have educational and working experience in marketing, which includes much in advertising as well. I'm very comfortable with the differences. If you want get into that, I can.
