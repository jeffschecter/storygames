I've been to Tucson a number of times (since I used to live in Phoenix) and I knew this was a nice time of year, but I wasn't sure what RinCon would be like. <br/><br/>In short, it was amazing. The staff was friendly and well-organized (they knew my schedule better than I did!) and always eager to get me supplies for games and directions to the next event. The players were awesome, the kind of cooperative, excited gamers that blow me away at the table. I had one of the best games of Dungeon World I've ever had (someone played a Paladin!) and finally got to play the Houses of the Blooded LARP again. And my panels were tons of fun; getting to sit on a panel with John Wick and Ken St. Andre was an honor. <br/><br/>I'm still on the plane flying back to Boston, but I'm already making plans to head back to RinCon next year. You should too! It's totally, absolutely, definitely worth the trip.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391940/#Comment_391940" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T08:27:20+00:00" title="October  1, 2012  8:27AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell us more!<br/><br/>How large is the event? <br/>Is it in a hotel? <br/>Where do people stay? <br/>Is it close to an airport? <br/>How is the food? <br/>What kind of games are run?<br/>Are there any perks for GMing?<br/>What can we learn from how they organize their event?<br/>How are game signups handled?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391942/#Comment_391942" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T08:32:23+00:00" title="October  1, 2012  8:32AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes! Moar!<br/><br/>The event was about 300 people, and the space (Holiday Inn Tucson) was quite large. In general, it felt spacious and laid back. Most of the con was local, but a bunch of people stayed at the hotel, which had nice rooms that were easily accessible. The hotel is quite close to the airport, but I'm not sure if there is a shuttle.<br/><br/>The food is great! Tucson has a bunch of fun places to grab food, but transportation might be a problem. The hotel set up a concession stand that sold fresh sandwiches, etc, for people that didn't want to leave the con.<br/><br/>The games ranged from Pathfinder to Fiasco, but there was definitely an absence of some of our favorites like AW or PTA. Mostly I think that's a function of the GMs, and the players were open to trying new things all over the con. I'm not sure about perks for GMing, but I'm sure the staff would work something out if people were serious about running a lot of games. They handle game signups online before the con, and then have a sign up table with sheets that people can list their names (with alternates) that they give to a GM right before a session. I think something like that could work great for a 4-hr room at GenCon...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391961/#Comment_391961" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T10:57:35+00:00" title="October  1, 2012 10:57AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was great to meet Mark &amp; Marissa, and great to hang with John Wick and Ken St. Andre again. Ken is a gem.  I got John to back off something he said in the GM's conference, a first in the history of the world.<br/><br/>I ran Fiasco, Penny, Ghostbusters, and Hunter: The Vigil.  This is actually pretty light for me, but as I get older I think I need to cut back a bit. The days of running 6 games and coming out ahead on the con registration/GM reward swag are done. Today my voice is still cooked and my bones ache, but I had a blast. If I'd run 2 more I would be completely wasted. <br/><br/>I saw a cool upcoming kickstarter for Dungeon Heroes, a tile-placement/exploration strategy game that looks amazing. Definitely going to back when it kickstarts in October.<br/><br/>I got a ton of stuff from the vendors including some D&amp;D Gazetteers, the new Iron Kingdoms RPG (boy, if I looked at gaming art or cared about glossy pages this would be super exciting instead of just cool), and stocked up my White Wolf collection dramatically.  I also played the Tales from the Arabian Nights boardgame re-issue, which was awesome.<br/><br/>The thing most people were talking about was Mark's Kickstarter panel. I had at least four people independently tell me how much they appreciated/got out of it.<br/><br/>John Perrine, Brian Poe and myself have somewhat primed the Tucson RPG community for independent games and "trying new things out", so we had a lot of interest in Fiasco. If we had the facilitators for it we could have run Fiasco continuously for three days and filled every slot, I think.<br/><br/>I was really quite pleasantly surprised. I expected a first-year con (because the crew that handled Rincon 2009-2010 left and it was a first-year crew), with the sparse crowds, organizational problems and low production values that entails (and I am okay with that for first year cons), but it was really very, very well done and from the player/GM perspective everything went smooth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
