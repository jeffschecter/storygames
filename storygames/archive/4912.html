The supplement will take the 120 best entries from the project, along with art donated to the project, and produce a free .pdf and at-cost POD.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're looking for new contributors, editors, and pundits, to help us create short entries, which will make up the pages of the eventual .pdf and POD.  Several entries have already been provided, along with a map (which some of you will recognize as Chuck McCann's Ravennia).  These are then polished up by the community according to the guidelines we've established, and then they can be nominated as "gold-star" entries.  Once we have approximately 120 nominated entries, we'll change gears into production and put out the final product.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the project is complete we will all have a new fantasy setting that we can use however we want for our own projects, whatever they may be.  Check it out!  Then tell me: What do you think?<br/>\n<b>The Great Hundred is... (roll 1d6 for a true answer)</b>]<br/>\n1.  An open content fantasy writing project<br/>\n2.

I don't mean this as criticism, just trying to understand.<br><br>1. What do you mean by "exotic" fantasy?  Is that an established sub-genre of fantasy fiction that I'm just not familiar with?<br><br>2. You mention that one or your main goals for the project is to have content that is "clich\xe9-free."  What's your plan for ensuring that this happens?  Reading through some random pages on the site, it seems to me that the feel so far resembles the kind of muddy "world culture remix" that is common in a wide number of roleplaying and fantasy settings.  I guess I wonder, with your open call for content, if the lack of strong leadership or established goals and guidelines for setting creation will lead to a setting that lacks a cohesive feel or strong striking elements (the Too Many Cooks problem).  Perhaps you've already got plans that address these issues, but I wasn't able to find them on your site.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110113/#Comment_110113" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T13:47:06+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  1:47PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2007 4:20AM by Ry.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In response to Jonathan (and thanks for the questions, they're legitimate concerns that I've thought about a lot):<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Exotic:<br/>\nBy exotic I really mean not-just-western-europe-based-fantasy.  It's really more focused on being its own thing (rather than say a mashup of D&amp;D-esque; settings).  The exotic is supposed to say to the contributor "Have distinctive flavor" not "Based on culture X"<br/>\n<br/>\n2a) Cliches:<br/>\nThe goal isn't 100% cliche-free, but it's substantially cliche free.  We don't want thinly-veiled Visigoths trashing a thinly-veiled Roman empire, or thinly-veiled Gondor vs. thinly-veiled Mordor.  Clarifying that is a good idea, so I will do so soon, unless someone else beats me to the punch (feel free).<br/>\n<br/>\n2b) Cohesion<br/>\nThe need for cohesion is the reason I didn't start tabula rasa, I put in some (admittedly - and explicitly - weak) skeletal entries.  We have different cultures in a region with southeast asian climate.  We have Living Gods that are very sword-and-sorcery kind of overlords, we have a big map that is also a baseline.  Further, I think that as project lead and a major contributor I can help give some direction - although this doesn't mean doing it "my way."<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, when the project began I used a much weaker definition of Situation, but Mike Holmes convinced me to improve it - that meant that the one entry I held up as an example of a good one (which I wrote) no longer reached the bar.  So I think that I can be respectful and encouraging of other contributors while providing leadership for the project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110157/#Comment_110157" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T16:10:34+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  4:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am very excited about this project, especially because I'll be helping Ryan to get it out to as many people possible (he says cryptically...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110162/#Comment_110162" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T16:21:24+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  4:21PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2007 5:13PM by Ry.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel</cite>I am very excited about this project, especially because I'll be helping Ryan to get it out to as many people possible (he says cryptically...).</blockquote>To avoid wrong impressions - this is a nonprofit endeavour and if any money changes hands in support of this project, that will be publicly posted.
