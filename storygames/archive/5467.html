I've just come back from Dreamation with a lot of feedback, but I'm looking for a little more on a specific issue.<br/><br/>The most fun aspect about the game right now is character creation.  Players take on the roles of people living on the street who've lost their identities and memories and gain them back through the course of the game.  In the first phase of character creation, players invent who they are now; what they look like, what they do to survive, where they stay, what they have, any sicknesses, injuries, etc.  They also each have a "Light at the End of the Tunnel," a driving motivation for wanting to get out of the situation they're in.  Nothing is explained at this point, as that will come later.  Here's an example from a playtest:<br/><br/><a href="http://somniturne.com/kon/ladygrey.jpg" rel="nofollow">Lady Grey</a><br/><br/>During the second phase, the character sheet is passed around along with a "Secrets Sheet."  Each player gets the secrets sheet and writes a sentence or two about that character's past that explains something on the character sheet.  Each time someone gets ahold of the sheet, they can either build upon what's already written or start a new thread and work on that one.  Again, here's an example:<br/><br/><a href="http://somniturne.com/kon/secrets.jpg" rel="nofollow">Lady Grey's Secrets Sheet</a><br/><br/>As you can see, her mother was always pushing her into living a life of luxury, which explains her Light at the End of the Tunnel and how she dresses.  All the other secrets explain what the player came up with in a similar way.  One important thing to note is that the player of Lady Grey doesn't see the secrets sheet.  They get revealed in play.<br/><br/>I'm not looking for help with this part, because pretty much every time I've run the game everyone's loved it.  Not only does everyone want to play to find out what happened to their characters, but they have a lot of buy-in with everyone else's characters.  They want the other players to find out all the cool/f***ed up stuff they wrote in their backstory.<br/><br/>This brings me to my problem; how do the secrets get revealed?  I've tried a couple of different methods, but I haven't hit anything out of the park yet.<br/><br/>In the first incarnation of the rules, the GM was responsible for revealing the secrets when it became dramatically appropriate.  Though this was the way that led to the most coherent storyline, it was frustrating for the players to have to wait for the GM to find out their own backstories.  Also the GM is responsible for sitting on a ton of secrets (if there's 5 players, there's 25 secrets), which is a ton of stuff to keep track of.<br/><br/>In order to give the players more authority to get their own backstories, I let players buy revelations with XP.  It sort of works to give the players more power to learn their backstories, but it completely screws up the coherence of the plot.  Sometimes it makes sense for a secret to be revealed in the story but the player doesn't have enough XP, and sometimes the player has the XP but buys it in a completely inappropriate time, making the revelation a lot less impactful than it could be.<br/><br/>I'm playing around with a couple incarnations of giving the other players at the table control of each other's secrets...like someone has Lady Grey's Secret Sheet and she has someone else's, and the players are responsible for that player's revelations, but I'm not convinced that's the way to go.  I want the players to get into exploring their own stories, and in my experience they can't do that as much if they're also worried about running someone else's story.<br/><br/>My thought is that my answer lies somewhere in aggressive scene framing, focusing on one character at a time but still working the other characters in with a supporting role.  Scene framing is a fairly new concept for me however, and I wanted to get some opinions from you guys so I  can point myself in the right direction before I drop too much time into developing it.<br/><br/>Thanks guys!<br/><br/>((PS, I've got a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kingdom-of-nothing" rel="nofollow">Google Group</a> for anyone living in the NYC area interested in playtesting))                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122503/#Comment_122503" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T17:11:46+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  5:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seriously wanted to recommend my own <i>Dead Inside</i> for you to look at, but it felt immodest.<br/><br/>I still like the "folded Secrets sheet" idea, with allowing PCs to "buy" the ability to view one aspect of their secrets.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somniturne" title="somniturne"><img alt="somniturne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somniturne">somniturne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122510/#Comment_122510" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T17:48:14+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  5:48PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll absolutely check out Dead Inside.

How about after all the characters' back stories are written out, they are written onto cards and distributed in a way that each character has a single piece of each other character's background.  This way, you'll have numerous sets of eyes and brains working on the task.  In order to keep from this detracting from each character pursuing his own story, the players should inject themselves into each secret they reveal.  It <i>should</i> link the players more closely while advancing the story of both the revealer and the subject of the reveal.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>"I used to go to chef class with Miss Grey, but I heard she went nuts!"<br/>"At the local dive, there's this drunken slob we call "Anaseptic Jack.'  He's upset over some tart that did him wrong."<br/>"Really?  I used to work with Jack almost ten years ago back at a paper mill.  That guy would put in 18 hour days, 6 days a week."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122550/#Comment_122550" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T19:54:23+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  7:54PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing that springs to mind for me is the refresher scenes in Principia.  In order to refresh your pools, you play out scenes that happen in between the action.  From the "design what isn't important" line of thought, that might be a way to go about it -- have a mechanical reason to play scenes that <i>don't</i> reveal a secret.  When it's time to play one of the scenes that will reveal a secret, you'll have had time to cope with the story effects of the last reveal, and you'll know that a reveal is coming up.  If those scenes in between secrets establish some new NPCs or plot points, you'll have more material to use to weave a decent and plausible revelation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somniturne" title="somniturne"><img alt="somniturne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somniturne">somniturne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122553/#Comment_122553" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T19:59:57+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  7:59PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cards are something that's been mentioned before by others...it's a really interesting idea that'll probably make it into playtesting soon.<br/><br/>I have background connections built into the system already, though I don't have the players doing it because they don't know their own backstories so they can't inject themselves into it.  I've toyed with the idea of having players inject other characters into the other characters' secrets, and though I've encouraged it where possible, it's not a hard rule.  There's a third phase of character creation where two relationship maps are created; one by the players explaining how they know each other now, and one by the GM about how the characters pasts are intertwined.  It's actually pretty easy to do when you've got all the sheets spread out in front of you.  You just try to find mutual friends, estranged family and loved ones and common organizations like the army or the mob...then you plug the characters in where you can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122555/#Comment_122555" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T20:05:54+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  8:05PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2008 8:08PM by xenomouse.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the player does a notably good job of revealing a secret, award them with a coin or two.

Everyone else at the table knows the secret, and is pushing the character towards the revelation.  The GM is responsible for outside antagonists<br/><br/>~there's some kind of currency awarded to the supporting players as the revelation scene is going on, either by the character who's being focused on or the GM (based on making the reveal as awesome as possible).  Whoever gets the most currency gets their scene next<br/><br/>~Chad, I'm really digging the idea that the color of the memory affects the mechanical reward.  I think I can work that in pretty seamlessly.<br/><br/>I think that the idea with the cards fits into this pretty well.  The cool part about that is that all the players have a hand in other people's secrets, which I think this does as well.  Instead of a jumbled mass of people throwing out revelations however, it's a little more focused.  I don't think I want to let the players guess their secrets because it kind of saps the drama out of the situation.

Just as soon as I finished reading the first post I was struck with the idea of using index cards for each individual secret, but then I was beaten to the punch.  Damn you all, you intelligent people!<br/><br/>Also, if you're thinking of doing something like you've written here, with a central character focus, I would definitely recommend reading both Prime-time Adventures and Shock:. Both of those games do such a thing and make it work fairly well at the table.  <br/><br/>I also feel like there's something going on between the various different traits in the character sheet and the secrets created for that character.  I was in one of the playtests at Dreamation, and I think that I brought this up with you.  We as players craft secrets based on the items written out on the character sheet that we've been handed, but using those items in game play has no connection to the secrets that are tied to them.  I feel like this is a missed opportunity.  There's a lot that can be drawn from those connections.  <br/><br/>Say, as a for instance, that I've got a character with a trait like "bare-knuckle boxer", and there's a secret that was created out of that trait.  Whenever I use that trait in game play, maybe the player holding that secret can offer tiny little hints of it to me as part of narration.  <br/><br/>Then again, Chad raises some very strong points.  Consider what you want the loss of memory to play like for the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122742/#Comment_122742" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T12:04:14+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 12:04PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: somniturne</cite>~In order to get the intensity out of the flashback scenes that's in my opinion integral to making the game fun, I'm going to have to go around the table, focusing in one one player at a time.<br/><br/>~That player is focused on until they hit their revelation.

We've got hard-stare harry the street fighter who's got the secret "killed somebody in the ring."  the scenes leading up to that revelation make him use whatever trait that secret was based on...in this case "bareknuckle boxing."  he gets pulled into a boxing match where he's on the verge of beating the guy to death.  There's a flashback revelation where he learns one of his secrets, then has the opportunity to change what he does in the present.  His choice now will affect the mechanical reward for the revelation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122752/#Comment_122752" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T12:27:29+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 12:27PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't seen it already, I suggest watching the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450340/" rel="nofollow">Unknown</a>.

Just like the audience of a movie, the players will enjoy the secret all that much more if they get the chance to figure things out on their own.  After they've shouted out some possibilities and are close to the truth of the secret, that's when you hit them with the flashback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122843/#Comment_122843" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T17:34:23+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  5:34PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MPOSullivan</cite>I just woke up from a nap so I'm too tired to edit out the quote from my post.
