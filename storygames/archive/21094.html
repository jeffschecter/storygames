Therefore the player can declare "my character walks into the trap" as a way of saying that "no, I think it's realistic that my character would fall into this trap here, there's no reason to think that they wouldn't". This is "disassociative thinking" because the player is thinking about an external issue such as realism or dramatic pacing instead of what their character would want.<br/><br/>In the first example the character has evidently noticed that there is a trap because they're carefully walking around it.<br/><br/>I don't expect that Sandra meant in either example that the character knows about the trap but decides to step into it anyway - that would be pretty weird, unless the character has mental problems, but if that were the case then obviously they would also do that in actor stance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462583/#Comment_462583" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T14:09:22+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  2:09PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra: I notice that you basically just have two stances in your model.

Presumably this stance categorization scheme would also have e.g. "random stance" for when the player is just doing random decision-making (say throwing dice), with no regard for the actual substance of the game.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a stance theoretician (I don't really get why people are so interested in that stuff), so I might have misunderstood your point, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462584/#Comment_462584" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T14:11:34+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  2:11PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2018 6:49AM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero, yes.

That's been a constant over every group, like 20 groups or so. On YouTube I sometimes see the "She steps into\u2026" or "Helen steps into\u2026" thing. <br/><br/>I added "second person" because this is S-G and I can really imagine a second-person, past-tense Impro game being fun. "Yes, but then you wrote that nasty letter! I can't believe you called her a living toad, as opposed to what\u2026 some sorta toad-lich?"<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> I later found out that the game <i>Nerver av st\xe5l</i> uses weird grammar in that way.

There's more to be said about a stance than whether it is an actor or director stance.<br/><br/>As a bit example of what I mean, I'm pretty happy with my stuff on "advocation play", which is a term I like to use for a specific stance that many forgite narrativistic drama games expect of a character player. I don't even know - or care - which stance category it would be placed in in the traditional stance theory; it's much more important to me that I describe the specific psychology, sociology and play technique of advocation play precisely, so as to be able to instruct players and write game texts appropriately. I find the idea of "flashlight dropping" similarly useful (I have this memory that I picked that one up from some post of yours), and have been using it regularly recently. A third example is "princess play".<br/><br/>All those examples are deeply stance-related, and it would not be wrong to characterize them as clustered constellations of stances+techniques+agenda. The issue of <i>what a player is thinking while doing decision-making</i> is absolutely central to understanding and using this sort of stuff in game design work, while the classification of these stances in stance theory terms is much less so, it seems to me.<br/><br/>Perhaps what I'm saying is that I don't see the immediate utility in the Linnean classification of stances. This is somewhat ironic considering how big I am on GNS theory, but that's how it goes - it's apparently not classification for the sake of classification that captures my interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462615/#Comment_462615" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T20:18:14+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  8:18PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My own stance-work in recent years has been more about specific heuristics that should be used with specific types of games, rather than about top-down categorization of stances.
