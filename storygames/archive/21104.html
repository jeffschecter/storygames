In many ways more similar to the original Kutulu that I messed up to create this messy system.<br/><br/>First, here are the relevant pages from Kutulu by Mikael Bergstr\xf6m <small>[BTW, to pronounce his name, think "Straw<b>ber</b>ry" not "<b>Bir</b>d", and make the "g" silent if you want, it's a very soft palatal approximant rather than a hard plosive]</small> (CC-BY-4.0 2017, my [Sandra] translation):\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kutulu" rel="nofollow">Kutulu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>To find oneself in fisticuffs, or\u2212God forbid\u2212an armed duel, is definitely something all civilized ladies and gentlemen with a modicum of self-preservation stay away from, to the greatest possible extent. Regrettably, it happens that the investigations the player characters undertake puts them in situations where there's no other choice.<br/><br/>When someone initiate force in any form, they have the initiative and acts first. Whoever is portraying that person state the action they intend to perform.<em>[... Kutulu-specific skill names elided ...]</em><br/><br/>People who are attacked will want to perform a counter-attack or at the very least try to avoid being hit by the attack aimed toward them.<br/><br/>When attack and possible counter-attack or defense has been performed, the initiative passes to the next person who is yet to act or react. When all participants in the battle has been given an opportunity to act or react, the initiative is reset and everyone is yet again free to declare actions.<br/><br/>This means that the battle is divided into rounds, in which every participant shall get an apportunity to act. Because of that, the in-fiction length of these rounds vary, but it's seldom longer spans than a second or two.<br/><br/>Sometimes it can get chaotic when many participants wants to declare actions at once; at those times, it's the game masters role to as quickly as possible untangle the mess and decide who attacks whom.<br/><br/>The advantage of acting early and jump on the initiative is that it gives you some control over who your opponent will be in the battle. The disadvantage is that you, when doing so, lock your action in and become vulnerable to being attacked by another participant. Every participant can only perform one action or reaction per round.<br/><br/>A declared action can not be undone. If it turns out to be based on a misunderstanding of the situation, the player character is assumed to have made a corresponding miscalculation in the inescapably stressful nature of battle.<br/><br/>If a player hesitates too much this can be counted as they conceding their character's action for the present round.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/kutulu-initiativ.png"/><br/><br/><em>Fig. 1. With graph paper the game master can easily keep track of who has acted. In the figure shown, Chester and "kultist 2" will get the opportunity to act before Patricia or "kultist 1" gets to act again.</em></p></div></blockquote>\nSo, my thoughts on that... first, there's a remarkable degree of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_game" rel="nofollow">coldness</a>". To initative violence <em>only</em> has disadvantages; in Kutulu, you can only defend yourself against one enemy at a time and the others get free shots at you (and are likely to kill you, given the damage rules on the pages that follow). On the other hand, you lock up your opponent too and prevent them from damaging your comrades.<br/><br/>Second, it's not as easy to port this protocol to D&amp;D as I first thought, because A. D&amp;D has four action types (action, reaction, bonus action and movement -- this could be fixed by instead of one square, I'd use a 2\xd72 square, if I could find paper that looked like this: <img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/kutulu_square_paper_frame.png"/>) and B. in D&amp;D, defending yourself doesn't cost an action. And if I'm going to keep using the "Players roll defense roll" variant, it'll get very chaotic, and C. D&amp;D doesn't have the same coldness because there's not simultaneous "deal damage to each other"; you have to survive to be able to deal damage back.<br/><br/>But what can I salvage from it?\n<ol><li>The rule that who ever initiates force diegetically \u2014 whether NPC or PC \u2014 acts first. Yes, this leads to a "speak fast to win"-situation, unlike Kutulu which mechancially rewards being cold. Not sure how to fix.</li>\n<li>Very un-raw, but: if your action is "Dodge" you can do it "in advance", spending your action in advance to get advantage on all defense rolls.</li>\n<li>The rule that if you're attacked, you then can "reply" right away <i>iff</i> you have any main actions, bonus actions, or movement left. That could mean attacking someone else, disengaging, fleeing etc.</li>\n<li>The limit of one action, one bonus action, one reaction and one movement per round is sacrosanct; if you've already spent your action, you have to wait until the next round to spend another action. To track this, we have:</li>\n<li>A grid paper with the PCs listed in initiative score order, room for monsters to be listed underneath.</li></ol>\n<br/>In other words, this is the precendence hierarchy:\n<ol><li>The "first-talker" (can be PC or NPC) if they haven't acted in this turn yet.</li>\n<li>Anyone who has been attacked <i>this round</i> and haven't acted yet</li>\n<li>Who has the highest initiative score and hasn't acted yet</li>\n</ol>\n(Monsters of similar type can attack in groups. E.g. "Five of the skeletons attack you!")<br/><br/>Defending (i.e. just surviving the attack normally), you can (obv) do out of order (unlike in Kutulu) and it doesn't cost any actions (unlike Kutulu).<br/>Dodging, you can do "ahead of time"<br/>Reactions, you can spend out of order, once per round.<br/><br/><br/>I think a flowchart looks more complicated than a simple precedence hiarchy but just for canonicity's sake:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/initiative-flowchart.png"/><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Wow! It's amazing how a small precedence list + a couple of exceptions turn into a super messy-looking system! <small>(I might have to apologize to GURPS, for it's system that was too complicated and messy for me to understand; perhaps it also started with simple exchanges and then had a couple of exceptions added, and more and more.)<br/></small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462902/#Comment_462902" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T10:01:29+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 10:01AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I called it "Messy Initiative System" in the rules doc I wrote up for the Spikes and Mels in my group.

Contains a lot of the same thinking and ideas as in this threads OP. The biggest change is that instead of four smaller boxes for movement, action, bonus action and reaction, I just have a forward slash for the three former ones (which have to be taken together) and a backslash for the latter.\n<h2>Messy Initiative System</h2>\nThis is nerdy and not something any player needs to understand. It's provided here for the Spikes &amp; Mels only. If that's not you, just don't worry about this text, the turn will flow to you normally.<br/><br/>OK, all gone? Just us rules nerds left? Good. Here's what I'm thinking:<br/><br/>To keep track of the action economy, every one is listed on a grid in this order: First, super-bosses. Then, the PCs and their henches in initiative score order (normally 10 + dex mod, but things like Remarkable Athlete and Jack of All Trades increases the initiative score). Last, all the pretties in no particular order (they all have a line of their own). Their initiative score doesn't matter.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/initiative-grid.png"/><br/><br/>The columns are the combat rounds. If you spend your action, move, and/or bonus action, that's marked with a forward slash. If you spend your reaction, that's marked with a backward slash. Once you've spent your action or your reaction, you have to wait until the next round to spend that type of action again. That's the action economy.<br/><br/>Now, in what order does everyone get to act?<br/>Surprise rounds, which only matter when one side is hidden from sight and actively, sneakily ambushing the other, are handled first. That doesn't apply to normal "You're talking to someone, and suddenly they attack!", that doesn't trigger a surprise round. But sneakingly attacking from the shadows does. When the surprise round's done, the following applies to both PCs and pretties:\n<ol><li>First, who first diegetically initiated force? Who shot first, Han or Greedo? They get to act first. (Once an initiator has been selected for the fight, there's no use "talking fast" to get to act sooner. It's only making the very first blow that makes you "initiator".)</li>\n<li>Then, who's been attacked already <em>this round</em>? They get to act before anyone else.</li>\n<li>Third tiebreaker is list order, top first.</li></ol>\nPretties can attack as a group.<br/><br/>Rolling a normal defense roll doesn't cost any action and you can do so whenever you're attacked, even if you've already spent your action.<br/><br/>When defending, you can if you want spend your action, if you already have it, to dodge. You'll get advantage on the defense roll and all other defense rolls and dex saves for the rest of the round. If you dodge, make your movement and bonus actions right away.<br/><br/>Now, those are the rules. I put them in a flowchart but when I did, it looked super complicated. But here it is, just to have a canon representation of my thinking.<br/><br/>[Here, I put the flow chart image from this threads OP, but bigger.]\n<h3>How this came about</h3>\nI've been wanting a more "conversation"-like initiative system for years, where things just "happen" without rolling up a list. And at first I tried colored disks and I tried a little circle and I've tried all sorts of things. At the con game this March I just had everyone sit in initiative score order and we went around the table. (Simple, but feels like a board game\u2014but maybe that's a positive thing? If this doesn't fly, that's what I'm going back to, just following the static initiative score always.)<br/><br/>Then I read the game Kutulu, which inspired this system. There are a couple of differences. First, Kutulu doesn't have any reactions (or bonus actions) like 5e has, you get your one action and that's it.<br/><br/>Second, in Kutulu, defending isn't free\u2014you can spend your full action to counter-attack. So if Alice attacks Bob and Bob counterattacks, they would roll simultaneously and the winner would deal damage to the other and the losers would deal no damage. And they've both spent their action for the round.<br/><br/>So that means, in Kutulu, that if you get attacked by three skeletons, you can only defend against the first one, the rest get to do damage to you with no opposition. (But damage rolls have about a \u215b chance of rolling zero damage, depending on the skill level of the monster.)<br/><br/>This also means, in Kutulu, that there is no benefit to quickly shouting "I shoot first!" because they will only counter-attack you back and then you can't defend for the rest of the round. Because of that, there's no need to have an "Initiative score" which I've kept from 5e, but moved it to a tiebreaker.<br/><br/><br/>Obviously I like 5e:s action economy, where defense is always free, more. Kutulu's system makes sense for it, because it's about scholars who are looking for clues and sometimes make a mistake and stumble into a monster nest. In 5e, people know what the hell they are doing so they can defend themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462904/#Comment_462904" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T10:17:59+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 10:17AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea is that it'll be "seamless" and "conversation"-like, and that it'll be "invisible".

After about 10 sessions with it I can attest that:<br/><br/>-Going by who speaks first works perfectly fine. You see, in VtM, players who get highest initiative do go first but benefit from knowing everybody else's actions. Here is the same thing. Yes, the player going first acts first, but his actions create opportunities for the next and so on, balancing things beautifully in this mess.<br/><br/>-I wouldn't mix it with 5e action economy. 5e is beautiful as it is in its pristine order and turns. This works best with a PbtA system. Messy turns call for messy actions, to do it do it and if you roll under the TN the GM makes a move. Rolled a 2? then the DM move affects EVERYONE (like an area attack, reinforcements arrive in 1d6 rounds, enviromental threat activates, etc) Does that mean PCs or NPCs get two actions on a round? More or less, it's actually like a soft threat, then a hard one and another soft threat, maaybe another hard one and that would be it. Without damage rolls it would look like:<br/><br/>DM: Two skeletons and a dirty heap of a fuzzy hairy dog-size blob appear in front of the group! The two skeletons advance, spears in hand and a cold stare in their eyes as their stab at you!<br/><br/>Fighter: I block with my shield! (rolls dice, sucess) Then I want to try and break their spears!<br/><br/>DM: Ok, roll again (fighter player rolls, partial success)... You manage to break one of the spears, which one?<br/><br/>Fighter: The skeleton on the right<br/><br/>DM: Ok, you move to the left to do so, but that separates you from the group. Who goes next? Wizard?<br/><br/>Wizard: I start charging my magic... (hesitates)<br/><br/>DM: Monk?<br/><br/>Monk: I jump across the room to kick the now unarmed skeleton and roll to the left to avoid staying in their reach (rolls, critical) All right!<br/><br/>DM: You manage to kick the unarmed skeleton against the other one, he doesn't fall but its out of balance...<br/><br/>Wizard: I cast grease at the floor! (rolls dice, partial sucess)<br/><br/>DM: Both skeletons fall, but now the fighter must move cautiously if he doesn't want to fall too!<br/><br/>Fighter: nevermind, I'll jump over both of them and try to crush them with my weight! (rolls dice, critical)<br/><br/>DM: SLAM! now both skeletons are reduced to pieces, you roll to the side mostly unscathed though you're out of breath for a moment.<br/><br/>Monk: what about the fuzzy thing?<br/><br/>DM: Roll perception... (monk rolls a two)<br/><br/>Monk: uh-oh<br/><br/>DM: It unleashes an explosive wave of cold magic! Everyone roll to dodge!<br/><br/>Wizard: Hey, wouldn't I knew if it was casting a spell?<br/><br/>DM It's more of a spell-like ability but sure, roll perception anyway.<br/><br/>Wizard: (rolls dice, partial sucess) <br/><br/>DM well, you notice but not in time to warn everyone -you can roll the dodge with advantage!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462921/#Comment_462921" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T17:19:38+00:00" title="May  4, 2017  5:19PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2017 5:26PM by 2097.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WM, the point of this system is to <i>have</i> the pristine turns and to <i>keep</i> the standard action econ, but in an order that's more likely to have response windows consolidated and to more often mesh better with typical diegesis.<br/><br/>Greedo: I've been looking forward to this for a long time.<br/>Han: Yeah, I bet you have.<br/>Han, to DM: I shoot him under the table!<br/>DM: OK, AC 11.<br/>Han rolls.<br/><br/>I wanted to encapsulate my thought process so that any question of "who acts first" is simultaneously <i>strictly formalized</i> while also having all of the appearance of being free-flowing, seamless\u2026<br/><br/>Just "to do it, do it", but with "invisible rules" under the hood.

It was a kinda high-fantasy 5e. After that we played an Old School Dungeon Delving Post-Apoc 5e, which used "phases".<br/><br/><small>The rules are here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EE-zv6c-21eJFq3oWllFjT_jpsgCJQ0dj8G4A9T0_6M/edit" rel="nofollow">Core</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A1YRtFEjdEihT_HksoLk7qTEkd6lpRNNe_e8h8Qvg-E/edit#heading=h.ylc38feyx5c" rel="nofollow">Monsters</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1730kstKsGtn-78UFt_c9R2cJpBhNRXvfnkte5Q0AOL4/edit#heading=h.ylc38feyx5c" rel="nofollow">Adventures</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rLLnceFsioVCncUzIxTZGA92g5miOBYfxlMKjqm-C3A/edit#heading=h.ylc38feyx5c" rel="nofollow">Treasure</a></small><br/><br/>The round is divided into four phases, which are resolved in order each round. Within each phase, all action occurs simultaneously.<br/><br/>1. Magic &amp; Miscellaneous<br/>2. Missiles<br/>3. Movement<br/>4. Melee<br/><br/>Within each phase, everyone commits to actions they're taking that phase in the free-and-clear, and we all roll simultaneously. A lot goes unsaid; we rarely mention who our target is, players rarely mention what their hirelings are doing; they just roll the dice and announce hits.<br/><br/>(To speed that process along, I usually announce monster AC, and assume they're focusing fire in the most efficient way possible. And we roll damage only for PCs, not hirelings and monsters.)<br/><br/>Each person still gets the same Action, Bonus, Move, and Reaction each round.<br/><br/>If you totally catch the other guy off guard, if you burst into action before he has a chance to respond, you can get a free surprise round, in which you can take a single action, bonus action, or move.<br/><br/>It's super fast. I'll definitely use this again when I go back to this style of game. I gotta say it worked way better than either popcorn or default 5e initiative, for us.<br/><br/>This game just concluded; we're playing board games &amp; one-shots while I try to wrap my head around how to run a game like <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent" rel="nofollow">Silmenume's APs from the Forge circa '06</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462979/#Comment_462979" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T09:09:58+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  9:09AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, very unusual, traditionally those systems had the order reversed, with spellcasting last. But sounds like a fast and easy system.<br/><br/>Yes, committing to simultaneous action where two people try to hit each other even if one or both of them die in the exchange can solve a lot of problems. In the OSR game where I was a player, that was what we did when our side initiatives tied.<br/><br/>Personally I'm just really allergic to a separate free&amp;clear phase when I first have to say things I'm going to do and then say things again to actually do them. I don't have a <i>lot</i> of experience with it, granted. We tried it in 5e when my friend was DM but it didn't last through the session. (One of the other players got very confused and upset. "Why are you asking me again what I do, I already said what I wanted to do"\u2014 the problem in that case, though, was confounded by his action being "I fire at them when they pop up from cover", something that already was a delay. So his action got stated three times. In the free &amp; clear, in his turn in the initiative, and when the guerilla actually popped out to shoot. (Admittedly that's a sign of a pretty un-thought-through system that still uses strict rolled initiative turns in conjuction with an [in that system] redundant free&amp;clear.)<br/><br/>The way I'd handle a system such as yours, Jeph, is to, instead of the free&amp;clear, just have people do things (and do them directly, not pre-declare them) but with the opportunity to "Before that happens, I\u2026" as in Magic: the Gathering, if it's from an earlier category. I.e. "I run towards you and strike at you" "I zap you with a lightning bolt" the bolt might kill the runner before the strike could land because it was in an "earlier" category.<br/>But if it was "And I strike at you", they would strike each other and maybe both could die.<br/>This would be isomorphic to your precedence order but w/o the f&amp;c. Huh, just brainstorming here.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>To speed that process along, I usually announce monster AC, and assume they're focusing fire in the most efficient way possible.

That was a sacred cow who's absence was surprisingly refreshing. But, we do roll damage when the hirelings and monsters crit.<br/><br/>[Edit: Huh, while I was looking for the cleave rule, below, I found something in the DMG I've never seen before. Instructions on how to handle crits. For example, a goblin has 5 (1d6+2). I've been doing 5 normally, and 2d6+2 on crits. But they suggest 5 normally, and 5+1d6 on crits. That's easier. But I'm not sure I'm going to switch. I love that a lowly goblin has a 0.14% chance of suddenly striking the heart and doing 14 damage.]<br/><br/>Knowing the most efficient focus fire isn't always obvious when the optional "cleave" rule from the DMG is in place (one of very few of those options we've turned on). But my heuristic is that they're usually attacking the most hurt one, which is dysergic to cleave but it's just a good common sense default. (The cleave rule, which I flinch at everytime I hear it because the name recalls such graphic violence, is that if you one-shot an unhurt enemy with a melee attack, the excess damage can hit another nearby enemy. If that enemy was also unhurt and is one-shotted, repeat the process. We use the rule because I use a lot of hordes of weenie enemies at higher levels. Bashing your way through a horde of skeletons\u2026 It's also because I want fighters to be good at fighting, wizards are already good at solving dungeon problems with their stoneshape and other spells, if their fireballs are better at mopping the floor from skellies than a fighter then why do we even have a fighter, I'm thinking.)<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for this opportunity to talk shop, it's a nice break from all the advocacy, theory, debate and analysis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462984/#Comment_462984" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T10:07:06+00:00" title="May  5, 2017 10:07AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Personally I'm just really allergic to a separate free&amp;clear phase when I first have to say things I'm going to do and then say things again to actually do them.

This feels extremely clunky to me, and almost unbearably so whenever more than two, maybe three characters at most are involved. Especially when you mix that up with Sorcerer bonus dice rules, which make an engaging, in-the-moment delivery core to effectiveness: breaking up the fiction with free-and-clear, which might involve taking it back and renegotiating your action, then rolling, then holding up until it's your turn to resolve... that feels like poison to the expected play-style, so that I can either have the initiative rules work at my table or the bonus dice rules, but never both at the same time. Add to that that even the simplest conflict situation in <i>Sorcerer</i> - 1 PC vs 1 NPC - is very likely to involve the GM playing two NPCs on opposite sides, as every PC carries around a minimum of 1 NPC demon, and you have a recipe for confusion and headaches [rolls eyes]. And I <b>love</b> Sorcerer, so I'm definitely going to have to find my own solution to this issue someday.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really like what you've made here. So much, in fact, that I might steal it, with little retooling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462985/#Comment_462985" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T10:18:39+00:00" title="May  5, 2017 10:18AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the kind words!

I have no plans for running games where combat is its own separate subsystem any time in the foreseeable future (but you never know), except for possibly <i>Sorcerer</i> - but <i>Sorcerer</i> is far enough from the D&amp;D-BRP-etc. paradigm that it poses very different challenges and calls for very different solutions. Also, I'm sorta busy rewriting <i>Everway</i> from the ground up as a GM-less Trollbabe. ;P<br/><br/>But I do like fiddling with mechanical bits, so who knows? It may happen for real. I'll tell you what's on my mind: I tend to dislike that role-playing games so often have that "combat/conflict is starting, gear up for it!" moment that feels a bit like zooming in from strategic/travel map to tactical/combat map in CRPGs/JRPGs. That's a reason AW works so well for me as an MC: I can manage action scenes and fights without ever breaking the flow.<br/>In that regard, your "messy" initiative system is way tidier than any AW fight scene as MC'd by me - it feels like a good compromise I could port to some other game or use as part of a whole-cloth new design. But what I'd probably attempt to do is make it messier - by trying to <i>somehow</i> do away with counting rounds and initiative scores entirely. I haven't put any serious thought into how, of course, but that's what I had on my mind when I wrote about "stealing" it. That's not something I'd want to use for a D&amp;D game, either, unless I was trying to push D&amp;D toward some bizarrely un-D&amp;D-ish creative agenda perhaps, such that in no way can "fairness" be a concern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462999/#Comment_462999" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T15:41:51+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  3:41PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Btw, if you want this version, save a copy because when I get home (am in furniture store) I'll make a change.

Great find! Resolving the reaction next flows naturally from that and I expect it to feel like game-play follows natural conversation about the fiction neatly.<br/>The only jarring moment is, who to hand the spotlight then? Consulting a list of initiative scores is of course the obvious thing to do in D&amp;D or derivatives, but how could I query <i>the fiction</i> instead? Going with whoever has been longer since last acting, or has been attacked last, still won't address this during the first round after the initiating exchange, so that I'd still have to retain initiative scores to organize the first round of the fight.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Re AW \u2014 yeah, my attempt at GMing DW left everyone unsatisfied in this regard and thinking that they had gotten to talk too little.</p></div></blockquote>\nIt helps that, in my AW games, most scenes only have 2 PCs in them, 3 at most. Even when there were 4 non-MC players juggling a total of 6 PCs, it was rare for 4 PCs to be interacting in the same scene.<br/>It also helps that, in AW, fights tend to end quickly, rarely lasting longer than a single exchange. That's because violence against NPCs tends to have lethal effects more often than not, while violence traded between PCs doesn't usually have mutual annihilation as its actual true purpose.<br/>I'm not quite an expert on DW, but I suspect neither of the above is especially true in that game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463023/#Comment_463023" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-06T04:00:43+00:00" title="May  6, 2017  4:00AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu: Dot-files are used with an app called GraphViz.<br/><br/>I changed 'was attacked first' to 'was attacked most recently'.<br/><br/>In Kutulu, instead of a list, they just keep the "who speaks first goes" \u2014 that's a difference between the two systems, in mine speaking first you go first, speaking second, well, that doesn't help. Kutulu's system works for it because it's so extremely disadvantageous to act in it, unlike D&amp;D. And if you hesitate you lose your turn. So you might be holding off until that bandit attacks your friend, then the bandit can't defend and you can just roll damage. But if the NPC bandit also hesitates, the keeper can call "new round" with a bunch of unfilled X:s.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
