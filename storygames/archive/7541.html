Even without pre-scripting, there's pressure for consistency, action now, and so on.  More than anything, they can get bored; an audience pulls at you to feed their attention.<br/><br/>Second, they make suggestions - sometimes when asked, sometimes in heckler form, but how they do so depends on the venue and the way the group has primed them.  And the suggestions are often the opposite of the pull for continuity and sense (they're moment-to-moment stuff, often); the pressure to make sense of those suggestions and fit them in is entirely on the actors.<br/><br/>Er, and a lot more stuff.  Like, a LOT more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167529/#Comment_167529" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T11:29:28+00:00" title="September  7, 2008 11:29AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the big things the audience-rules would do is reward reincorporation.

They have no agenda (other than witness and understand the play). Their actions will not be affected by anyone's acting (even if their feelings and/or thoughts are). In a way, they act as impartial judges that care about the final outcome, not about what the actors intended. (This is important even with non-improvisational theater, since most audiences do not know exactly what the script would say, but other actors do.

Or maybe you even decide you won't arrest him (or allow him to escape).<br/><br/>Or maybe he didn't truly committed disorderly conduct, but you arrested him because of some weird family feud...<br/><br/>So yes, from the outside it looks the same, but because he is involved, those parsing events, responding, judging and stuff <b>are not</b> the same. I'm not saying they have to be more or less worthy, or that they are wrong or right. All I'm saying is they are different.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167759/#Comment_167759" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T12:16:32+00:00" title="September  8, 2008 12:16PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Tristan: That's all about people's<em>motives</em>... but what they do as audience (parsing events, responding, judging) seems very much the same.</blockquote>\nI'm on stage with you and Josh.  Tristan's in the audience.  <br/><br/>You 'go to the fridge', stage left.  I miss that bit, and 'go to the fridge', stage right.  <br/><br/>ACTOR: Josh, an actor, knows that this is screwed.  He give me feedback - he has his character walk over to stage right to get a beer, turn, and say "Dammit, Levi, how many times have I asked you to take those rollers off the fridge?"<br/><br/>AUDIENCE: Tristan, in the audience, doesn't have a character.  He expresses confusion over "what the hell?", but does not a single thing to fix it.<br/><br/>In Improv, if you declared something, there's no meta-discussion, no-take-backs.  Audience can say "you bombed that", but won't fix it.  Actors fix things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167765/#Comment_167765" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T12:46:35+00:00" title="September  8, 2008 12:46PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The audience never fills in inconsistencies or gaps in what they're viewing with created material?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I'm thinking rather intently of the <i>X-Files</i> here ... but, honestly, I see this sort of natural interpolation happening <b>everywhere</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167767/#Comment_167767" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T12:54:27+00:00" title="September  8, 2008 12:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>The audience never fills in inconsistencies or gaps in what they're viewing with created material?</blockquote>\nNot <i>on stage</i>.<br><br>Hmmmm!<br/><br/>I'm starting to think, here, that to actually do this thing, such a game would need fairly strict rules on "performing" - the idea being that when your character is onstage, you the player are "on" - no side talk of any kind, period.<br/><br/>(Part of this exercise is, really, to imagine a mini-game-thing where players feel like onstage actors, where there's no "safe" step back into "let's pause and consult", and where there's good action and bad action.  A serious "thrown into the deep end" kind of thing.
