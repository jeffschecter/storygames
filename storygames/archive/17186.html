This is a thread to discuss how to do (or not do) sex in role-playing games. I'll open it up by describing a simple method I've started using this fall, in which players engage in sex-scenes by using a set of specific tools. <br/><br/>The idea is to make sex a part of the game, and the life of the characters, without making it tacky or pornographic. We want scenes that dwell on relationships, and that strengthen the bonds between characters, and between characters and NPCs.<br/><br/>Here's the way we do it:<br/><b>- You hold hands while in a sex-scene, and look into the eyes of each other<br/>- You always do it with co-players, not the GM<br/>- You say a sentence, and are answered by the co-player<br/>- How many sentences you exchange is up to you<br/>- How detailed or superficial you do it, is up to the two of you<br/>- Other players and the GM sit silent while you do your sex-scene<br/>- A sex-scene gives your character a free die-bonus to be used in other scenes later in the game</b><br/><br/>We've already had some beautiful scenes by using these simple tools. <br/>- They have ranged from the very simple; <i>Player 1: We have good sex! Player 2: Yes, we have a nice night!</i> <br/>- and goes on to scenes with more detail and engagement; <i>Player 1: I kiss you! Player 2: I stroke your back! Player 1: I take your cock into my mouth! Player 2: I moan, and bite your shoulder! Etc ... </i><br/><br/>I look forward to see more exploration of the field by my players. It is done in a positive manner, and leads to a new and exciting field of human experiences being opened to our game-play. Having a party, with characters engaging in sex afterwards, is fun! Having characters live whole lives, with most venues of real-life interaction open to actual gameplay, is good for the game (at least for the kind of game we do; an frpg with realistic coloring).<br/><br/>Having characters expressing themselves in this field of life is a bit challenging (which I expected), but most of all fun (which I hoped, but was ready to be disappointed about)!<br/><br/>So; having sex in role-playing games is possible. If done the right way it is positive, and fun.<br/><br/>Any thoughts? <br/>Experiences?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389886/#Comment_389886" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T03:28:09+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  3:28AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2012 3:28AM by James_Mullen.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The idea is to make sex a part of the game, and the life of the characters, <b>without making it tacky or pornographic</b>...<br/><br/>... scenes with more detail and engagement; <i>Player 1: I kiss you!

Sex scenes happened but they were usually brief and more in the "We had a good night" description or focussed on dialogue between the characters that was important to advance the story. Once it was asked how they were positioned because of an attack happening at the moment.<br/>The holding hands part is a good way to create intimacy, but between the players, something they might want for their characters but not for themselves. Going into too great detail I could imagine making me uncomfortable as a player at the table. But I am not someone who like too talk about sex into too much detail anyways.<br/>I can see it working for the right group but for mine I will mostly stay with: "We have awkward teenage sex?" "Yeah, but my character is less clumsy than yours." "Allright cut to when they are done." and the like and won't introduce the hand holding.<br/>I did not feel a lack of detail in sex scenes before.

I've played chracters where seduction as manipulation was a big thing, e.g. my AW Skinner and Maestro'D.  Spending time on the set-up and fall-out was important, but the sex itself wasn't, because it was about whether and how the characters got what they wanted from people.<br/><br/>We had a more detailed and graphic sex scene in Annalise, because it was about the seduction of one of the characters by the Vampire, and highlighted what the Vampire was about: control, voyeurism, contempt for lesser beings.  How he had sex was telling, how the PC responded was telling.<br/><br/>Sex in Monsterhearts has tended to be hand-waved, but I like to focus in on the afterglow/aftermath.  Yes, you were all hot to roll aorund with each other five minutes ago.  Now that you have, what's going on?  How do you feel?  Are you talking?  Cuddling? Making eye contact?    One of my favorite moments was when two post-coital PCs were being all "Yeah, cool, I guess that was a thing", and the third who wanted more from then successfully turned them on again as he left, transforming the mood into, "Huh, I guess that really *was* a thing."  There have been times when we focused on the sex itself, but mostly because the sex was the story: you find yourself in someone else's body in the middle of sex, you lose all control and assault your date, etc.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel has had lots of smoldering glances, but the games always dissolved before people cast aside (or fulfilled) their Beliefs and gave in to their passions.  And that was a key thing: the sexual/romantic relationships were encoded in the Beliefs.  The things one will do for Artha.<br/><br/>Some sex-as-color in games of Fiasco and The Final Girl, but nothing that was lingered on.  More to establish fodder for later interactions, or in the case of The Final Girl, to tap the relationship mechanic.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389907/#Comment_389907" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T07:31:37+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  7:31AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I normally ask for exactly one detail:<br/><br/>"Who gets up first after?"<br/>"Where do your shoes end up?"<br/><br/>Stuff like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389908/#Comment_389908" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T07:57:21+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  7:57AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most I've described sex in was Call of Cthulhu... wait, typing that sounds horrible.<br/><br/>A PC was married to an NPC.  The NPC was quite ill with an unknown disease and having visions, and the PCs were on a boat travelling across the ocean to see a doctor.  The player brought up trying to sleep w/ his wife.  I described the sex as being somewhat awkward as it had been awhile since they had had sex, and needing to stop in the middle for a bad coughing fit, but it was overall pleasant.  The player was happy with that description, and it was also relevant beyond defining their immediate relationship, as the afflicted lady was soon calling for the byakhees that carried her away.  <br/><br/>I'm not really sure how I'd run it in a lower-GM authority game.  I really like "Who gets up first?" but I'd probably ask either afterglow stuff, or ask the player if the scene is awkward somehow -- if it was Monsterhearts, I'd potentially ask the player "So what went awkwardly wrong during that scene?" but the sex moves carry a lot of punch as it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389914/#Comment_389914" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T08:46:48+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  8:46AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I normally ask for exactly one detail:<br/><br/>"Who gets up first after?"<br/>"Where do your shoes end up?"<br/><br/>Stuff like that.</blockquote>\nAwesome.

This method makes it simple to play sex-scenes, and safe. And that makes for more fun, as each one of us go as far as he/she wants to. <br/><br/>I expect this simple and specific method to make the exploration of sex and sensuality a bit bolder too, as the game goes on, and players learn to trust each other. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389932/#Comment_389932" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T12:02:45+00:00" title="September 12, 2012 12:02PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it.

At this year's Fastaval, two games focussing on sex used variations on the theme, my own My Girl's Sparrow and Summer Lovin' by Lindahl, Nilsen and Westerling.<br/><br/>I think the question to pose before pulling this kind of tool from the box is, "why not fade to black/cut to pillow talk". In the case of SL, the answer was something like, it's fun, especially when it gets a bit awkward, and in the case of MGS, the answer was, the details of how people act together in bed can make for great and subtle relationship drama - especially when you can contrast the hot stuff and the fumbly awkward stuff. So unless there was a good answer to that question for any given game, I wouldn't tack on detailed sex. I guess it might make sense in some takes on Monsterhearts for instance, to look at the embarrasments and fumbling, and for who's in control and treats who how, and how does that contrast with bragging, gossip or denials later. Those are relevant teen sex drama questions. In your average heroic fantasy campaign, or even your average game of Apocalypse World? Not so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389948/#Comment_389948" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T13:38:48+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  1:38PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sex has come into one of my games more lately; two characters are in on-again/off-again relationships, one of them rather stormy.

Why not with the GM?</blockquote>In a classical rpg the GM is in a special position, and that may muddle the field a bit.<br/><br/>And more; the particular game I've developed this technique for, is a game with teenagers. It would not be right for me, a man at 50, to involve myself in detailed sex-scenes with players of 15-16-17. So the moment an interaction between a PC and NPC develop into a sex-scene, I step back and let one of the players play out the NPC involved in it. The players are quite happy with that solution.<br/><br/>As for the quality of the scenes; up until now they have varied ...<br/>- embarrassing and clumsy<br/>- short and superfluous<br/>- detailed and beautiful (but still a bit tense)<br/><br/>All the sex-scenes so far have seemed like fun for the players, and have added some spice to the interplay.<br/><br/>We play elves, and elven culture in the fantasy-world of Fabula has a very libertine attitude towards sex and sensuality; all kinds of sex is permitted, playful behavior is normal, flirting will always take place at parties, around the camp-fires and at the grand feasts. To have this culture manifest itself in the gameplay, I had to come up with some way of doing sex in the game. And I had to prepare the players for what lay ahead of them; how to "get into" the elves. <br/><br/>So far it has worked nicely, the players are doing their best to create an elvish mood of joy and sensuality, by framing their own scenes with bathing, dancing, eating, laughing, flirting ... and the occasional spice of sex. Their efforts combine to create a setting of jocular nature lovers, a happy-go-lucky bunch of green-heads in the woods. <br/><br/>I really like the way things are going! It will be a very sound basis for the rest of the campaign, which will go into action-hyperdrive in two months or so, when the evil forces amass outside the elven forest, and makes the campaign a high-fantasy drama of saving the world!

I invite my players to challenge that feeling, and to use it as they step into a landscape of touching beauty.<br/><br/>I like to challenge myself in role-playing games. I develop methods to challenge my players too. Some of the methodic tools I use are based on <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">trust</span></b>; you have to invest trust in your fellow players, to be able to "get it". <i>You must give trust, to get trust. Trust is a gift that works both ways.</i><br/><br/>I am very careful in how I introduce such tools, to ensure that the players understand that they are dependent on the trust of each other, and that breaking that trust will break the game, not only for the other players, but for you too. <br/><br/>My players generally get it, and those that don't are guided into the right stance by me, in mild terms, to ensure they understand fully how the game works. The guidance is done to ensure my players are able to participate in the game, as it is, and as fully and freely as they can, without having bad conscience for having done anything "wrong".                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389958/#Comment_389958" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T15:36:45+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  3:36PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly this makes me reflect that more advanced nations that have universal, sensible sex education (I'm looking at you, Scandinavian countries) starting at an early age handle sexuality <i>quite differently</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389965/#Comment_389965" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T16:08:04+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  4:08PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I would be really uncomfortable with that level of intimacy in a game, and I'm really curious as to how people's partners react to this style of play, or how they would react if they walked in mid session. <br/><br/>I'm also curious about play across gender and sexuality, does using these techniques feel different when the person you're having in character "sex" with aligns with your own sexual preferences?

Thinking about the sex scenes that've played out in games I've been in, there's no one fixed pattern to the genders of the participants, nor their attraction levels in the real world. A large number of these scenes have been between two guys who weren't attracted to one another (but, that makes sense: the hobby is full of 'em).<br/><br/>Yeah, two straight guys can roleplay a hot sex scene together and take it seriously. It can get hot n' heavy in the fiction.<br/><br/>I know when I play out a sex scene in an RPG, my level of attraction to the person sitting across the table from me doesn't have an impact, <i>until I start actively thinking about that factor</i>, and then it can have pretty wildly varying impact. When I start thinking about my real-world attraction to someone during an in-fiction sex scene, I move to wrap the scene up or "tap out" as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Roleplaying out a sex scene requires a couple things: trust, and the ability to "opt out" or end the scene as quickly as possible. Tomas' example in the first post has these elements. You can say a single line, and then be done. Or you can keep exploring the sexual tension.<br/><br/>(The hand-holding thing is weird, to me. I think it's a cultural difference, though, not a "weird sex thing" that Tomas is doing. In any case, I can see how it'd make it easier to establish trust and continually monitor one another's comfort levels. Which is important.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389966/#Comment_389966" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T16:14:03+00:00" title="September 12, 2012  4:14PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also worth noting, maybe:<br/><br/>Most of the time, when sex comes up in a game that I'm in, it's skipped passed with a simple: "So we have sex, I guess.

Sometimes we fade to black if the act of sex isn't important to the story. However if there is an important plot point or character development to be had in the scene, then I would encourage my players to stick with it. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of shifting stance with sex scenes, going more into an author stance, maybe describing what is happening in third person rather then as a direct first hand experience. I like to keep a distance from my characters anyway when I play, and I think that if you have a group who may not feel comfortable with each other it's a good way to separate character from player. So if my character starts being intimate with you, it is my character, not me. <br/><br/>Sometimes it's good to have a sense of immersion and exeperence a scene first hand, others times and (I think sex scenes are an example of this.) it seems more natural to see your character as a character in a story, rather then as an extension of yourself or a vessel for direct emotional experience. <br/><br/>Sex is a big aspect of our identity, and how and with who we choose to be physically intimate has huge personal ramifications. playing around with those personal factors is really powerful stuff. It's more then an issue of trust, or maturity.<br/><br/>Potentially I can see in-game intimacy as a social minefield, what happens if a player becomes physically aroused? <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/ThomasHVM">@ThomasHVM</a> it's really interesting to me that you identify that it would be socialy Inaproprate for you to engage in this kind of intimate contact with your teenage players, but ok for them. I'm sure this is all done in a spirit of positive mutual trust, and I'm most certainly not accusing you of anything untoward, <br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>You are acknowledging that there is a real world social dimension to this style of play, if it was just about character intimacy then I don't see that it would matter who of the players where intimate with each other, or if they had a sex scene with the GM. <br/><br/>For the record I find your method really interesting and I'm sure that it produce interesting play experiences, but as I said in my last post it's not something that would appeal to me personally. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_389990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389990/#Comment_389990" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-12T22:54:19+00:00" title="September 12, 2012 10:54PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2012 11:20PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First; the <b>Fastaval</b> tradition is great!

Thank you!<br/><br/>As for violence and sex; both topics controversial, but eliciting quite different reactions in role-players:<br/>- Violence is fun!<br/>- Sex is uncomfortable ...<br/><br/>Strange. Can there be a correlation between these two reactions? Could it have something to do with a lot of us choosing an escapist stance in role-playing games, that includes an emotional distance that is not healthy? And by "emotional distance" I also include a distance to our fellow players; we wear masks, to mask the fact that we do not really trust each other in the game. It makes us enjoy killing living things, while we abhor the showing of emotions and giving comfort to each other ...<br/><br/>In my world (and fantasy) emotions are fun! I love playing fantasy-rpgs, but I do not find it very interesting to play around with emotionally empty elements. Conflicts are mostly about emotions to me, so emotional conflicts in rpgs are all the more engaging. <br/><br/>My players seems to agree with me; they generally report that expeditions into D&amp;D-country are dead boring! But of course; they have been "raised" by me, and love emotional content in their game-play.<br/><br/>At conventions I play a lot with new players, mostly adults, and they often get a bit shocked in meeting with some of my methodic tools. I work hard to generate a lot of trust around the table initially, so this goes well for most people; they get over the shock, and have more fun than they ever had with a role-playing game before (yes, a lot of them say so). Some bow out (app. 2 in 100), and that's ok.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390004/#Comment_390004" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T06:38:40+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  6:38AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well we can show emotions in games without going into roleplaying sexual fantasys.

"Roll for sex ... critical success!"<br/><br/>Personally, most of my group has so far been totally uninterested in in-game sex and generally extremely uncomfortable when any kind of flirting happens between characters. The one exception is one guy who likes to play "ladies' man" characters as a player and "sexy women" characters as a GM. He once once tried to use a female NPC to seduce a male PC in order to extort something out of him, which was both extremely frustrating for the player (who insisted that he didn't care what the seduction roll was, he didn't want her) and also visibly uncomfortable for the other players. In our last game, while I was GMing, he very successfully rolled for seduction against a female NPC with his male PC, and I realized quickly that some of the other players were getting uncomfortable even with extremely light and brief roleplaying of flirting (smiling, "let me give you my number, what are you doing later," etc.). If we can't even get away with light flirting, I have a hard time imagining anything other than "fade to black" for sex scenes.<br/><br/>In summary: Have you ever seen that episode of <i>Community</i> where they play D&amp;D?

"I roll my Charisma to flirt my way past the guards". "I roll my Seduction to bed the bar wench".<br/><br/>In our Monsterhearts game, nearly all the sex has been to induce more drama. It's virtually assured to stir up some dramatic shit if you sleep with a prominent NPC or bust into someone's PC-PC relationship Turning People On with reckless abandon. The sex moves reflect this as well with effects like "from this point on you have an emotional bond and instantly know if they slept with someone else". That bond's just begging to be broken.<br/><br/>Sex driven by Beliefs in Burning Wheel might be tools (like "I will cement my position as head court concubine and the Vizier's trusted adviser"), or to establish strong emotional bonds ("I will make my brother-in-arms' widow happy no matter what the others may feel is appropriate"), or as character exposition ("I will take steps to ensure my true feelings towards Larianne must never be revealed" - example a bit weak, I know).<br/><br/>I have seen very few examples of sex in games being framed as truly romantic and life-positive, although it looks like Tomas may be going for something like that in his games? Grey Ranks and Bliss Stage strike me as possible exceptions, but I have not played and cannot comment. In the few "rom-com" themed games I've seen, if there's an emphasis on sex it's usually to portray it as awkward for its comedic value or as a means to inject drama / create complex relationship structures. <br/><br/>And then you have games in which sex is at least frequently framed as abusive and controlling (, violent, transgressive...) - games with occult and/or horror themes often act like this (Vampire, Kult, Sorcerer, Wraith, virtually every Vincent Baker game evar). Furthermore, you have games where sex or seduction is used as a tool towards an end drift close to or even into this abusive/controlling spectrum, maybe if only subjectively to certain players. That can be very uncomfortable to people with trauma, but even to people whose mode of roleplay is very immersive. When your enjoyment of the game is "trapped" within the shell of your avatar, and your avatar loses its agency through being subjected to abusive, controlling, violent sexual acts, it can feel traumatizing or at the very least uncomfortable and enjoyment-sapping.<br/><br/>While the latter part of my post is informed mostly by reading Tomas' <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17201/are-games-dangerous" rel="nofollow">other post</a> (questioning why games often do not allow mechanized inducement of sexual/romantic emotions in PCs), it's perhaps worthwhile to consider what techniques you're using for playing sex scenes based on the theme and premise of the game you're playing. For example, I can't see myself going into much detail when playing out a Sex Magick scene in Kult or a sexually loaded feeding scene in Vampire, and would probably steer away from scenes like that involving PCs unless specifically intending to make people extremely uncomfortable in the interest of emphasizing the horror genre - but I'd also try to avoid seemingly benign sex scenes in games like that altogether out of fear that they might turn into something emotionally scarring. Of course, it's also a staple of the genre. Proceed with caution.<br/><br/>If your game and genre and group seem likely to frame sex as something positive and life-affirming, I think a technique like Tomas' would work great. I think a lot of the icky feelings people have about it stems from considering its use in games where sex is framed differently, like playing out a pseudo-pornographic scene with the bar wench for no other purpose than a bunch of dudes sitting around arousing each other, or playing out a seduction scene to get past the guards which the GM takes too far into gang-rape / abuse territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_390363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390363/#Comment_390363" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-15T16:34:16+00:00" title="September 15, 2012  4:34PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 1:04AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, Lachek! You diversify the picture far better than I have been able to do, and you do it in a very constructive way. Thank you!<br/><br/>Framing is very important. Role-playing groups often frame themselves unconsciously, "choosing" by social manipulation and/or peer pressure to adapt a certain style of play. And that reflect in how a lot of people react to methods that does it the other way around. I work with simple methods that effectively put the players in a certain frame of mind, to help them produce the game-play I really want them to have. It is done consciously, and openly. <br/><br/>In the opening of this thread, I give you a sketch of the technique I use in relation to sex, in my gaming these days. The technique is used in a certain frame, yes; a romantic, positive and relation-building one. We are using this technique to build up an elvish fantasy-culture where playful sensuality and joyful sex is very prominent. We use it to strengthen the bonds between PCs, and PCs-NPCs, but also to strengthen the bonds each character has to the elvish culture. It has worked nice. We enjoy it.<br/><br/>The reason we enjoy it, is that I have carefully instructed the players how to behave when playing this game. We play with <b>trust</b> and <b>respect</b> as our guiding principles. What the principles amount to, in actual behavior, is communicated to the players beforehand, in clear examples, so none of them are in any doubt to what is the correct way to behave. Any breach of the trust is corrected at once, calmly and effectively, to keep the breach from destroying the game-play, and to reestablish the necessary trust. There is a positive feel to the communication, and that feel is meant to correspond to the feel of the elven culture we are trying to bring alive in our game. We actually succeed in making the interplay very positive, and really enjoy it! It is great to have a whole game-session with pure joy; dancing, singing, swimming, romping about in the woods, and flirting around the camp-fire. Some of the scenes are beautiful. Some are touching. And some are quite laden with sex and emotion. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390376/#Comment_390376" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-15T22:54:55+00:00" title="September 15, 2012 10:54PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You omitted "hilarious and crazy" as a sex emotion.

But the anonymity shouldn't be overweighted: if you do a sex scene with someone's character, it's not like it is the last time you will interact with that player.  Everybody's got their own preferences on how far to let it go before the FTB (Fade to Black).  I generally prefer not to FTB: if you can't enjoy the sex scene, it might be better to play a friend angle or unrequited love, rather than an angle that actually proceeds towards romance.  But that's not the best option for everyone who likes romantic stories.  Particularly people who are married IRL tend more often to choose to FTB, and that's got to be respected.<br/><br/>I was having a friendly debate with someone just the other night, after they implied a straight male player who is uncomfortable rping a sex scene with another straight male playing a female character is an issue of failure to separate IC from OOC.  He argued for strict IC/OOC separation, as when two writers collaborating on a story that happens to contain a sex scene.  Whereas, I argued for treating the player-character relationship as a hierarchy: regardless of what the characters do or don't do, a sex scene fully engaged in by two players is (in addition to whatever else the situation might be) a very intimate thing in its own right.  (I suspect I'm in the minority in this on most MUSHes, where failure to separate IC from OOC more often causes drama than failure to respect the player-character hierarchy.  But I still hold it's the more stable position for anyone that can see both sides.)<br/><br/>Personally, the romance genre is way up there in my list of favorites.  Gay fantastic romance is what I'd be reading all the time if only I weren't already scraping the mucky bottom of the e-book barrel.  It's also what I like rping, and I agree with Tomas that romance without beautiful sex scenes feels less than complete.  But rather than make story-gaming rules for restricting what happens in the scene, I take the opposite approach: my personal rules restrict <i>whom</i> I do a sex scene with, not how the scene goes.  I won't, for instance, do a sex scene with anyone who has an IRL romantic partner.  I know it's not necessarily cheating from their shared perspective, but I know from unintended experience that it makes <i>me</i> feel like I'm coming between them or being a third wheel.  It isn't that TS is OOCly romantic (or at least, not at all usually); but it is that TS is OOCly <i>intimate</i>, and I'm not comfortable sharing that level of intimacy with someone who's got someone else they could be sharing it with.  Though again, this is a pragmatic, personal rule -- not a moral.  It's occasionally taken a while to explain that to the players I've rejected.<br/><br/>In the romance itself, though, some story-gaming rules come into play.  Because it's fun, of course.  In one of the most entertaining long-term relationship stories I've had, we'd rolled at every turn.  Who would have the courage to confess this or that feeling to the other?  Or who would get the drunkest and do something they might not otherwise do?  How would the other take this behavior?  Etc.  Since it was a setting in which homosexuality was taboo, and one of them was bisexual rather than gay besides, and they both were living in a dog-eat-dog ghetto, it seemed like it took forever in RL time for them to finally become something like real romantic partners.  And even then, we rolled everything, from who was the more successful hunter that day, to who pleased the other better at night.  <br/><br/>The latter was based on the sorts of poses we wrote during sex scenes, and then we'd continue to play out the scene as if the winner had a social upper hand and could better guide the course of what they talked about while being romantic with each other.  His character might try to convince my character not to go off to war or do some crazy stunt; my character might try to convince his to help in some crime or to stop seeing whores and other women.  Then, at the end, maybe another series of rolls to see who made the most lasting impression.  Over the course of a few months, things boiled over to the point that my character tried to poison his with fertility drugs so that he'd get banned from the whorehouse.  Then they both got arrested for it when the witness mistakenly supposed they were together conspiring to poison a third party with an actual, fatal poison.  And my character had to confess his actual intention to keep them both from being tried for attempted murder and conspiracy.  It was awesome, and while we could have theoretically played it out without posing the sex scenes, I don't think it would have had nearly the impact.  Everything started with the poses and led from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_390418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390418/#Comment_390418" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T10:27:39+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 10:27AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 10:28AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting post, Burr! Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experiences! <br/><br/>I do not mind doing sex-scenes with people in relationships. Most people I game with are in relationships.<br/><br/>I have made the technique mentioned in the start of this thread to make it easy and safe to play sex-scenes. It works for the players I currently play with. But there are different ways to do this, of course. <br/><br/>I would really like to see an actual play report from you, Burr, on how a sex-scene may play out in your free-form way. Could you indulge us?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390440/#Comment_390440" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T13:36:57+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  1:36PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 1:46PM by Burr.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Errrr.... no. :8)<br/><br/>(Haha.)<br/><br/>But I will say that for the relationship I was talking about, it was for the most part very improvisational.  Dice rolling was a guide and nothing more.  Roll whatever you want, with as many different rolls as you want, with either an explanation of what each one is being rolled for or simply what stats are being rolled.  Then pose in a way that interprets whatever the hell you think the results mean compared to the history of rolls that came before as lenient precedent.  Neither one of us ever disagreed.  Whenever he interpreted it in a way very different from how I did, I went along with his version, because -that's- the version in which he might have some interesting twist or turn coming to formation in his head.  And since he never verbally disagreed with my rolls, I assume he extended the same courtesy for similar reasons.  The rolls weren't to constrain what -could- happen, but merely to nudge us towards one or another of the interesting paths we could foresee.<br/><br/>There were two exceptions to that, however.<br/><br/>1) The first exception was when it seemed like a choice of two paths was super important for dramatic rather than merely thematic reasons: like when either one of us tried to lie to the other.  Then we tended to favor a harder-edge sort of roll, just so there'd be that tension of not being able to take it back if we actually went through with it.  For instance, since we were in separate gangs and we both took loyalty seriously, we sometimes had to do jobs that we couldn't let the other know about, even if the consequences might come to negatively affect them at some point down the road.  This caused a good bit of lying during romantic scenes, even as we promised to protect the other from all the bad shit we could currently see rolling down the pipes.<br/><br/>2) The second exception was if one of our characters was trying to convince the other of something that, as players, we both wanted to <i>potentially</i> happen -- or sometimes when we definitely wanted it to happen eventually, but where letting it take time and be uncertain added suspense -- but only when that the thing didn't feel like something the persuadee would plausibly believe or do without the other being extra convincing, and when all the other elements had fallen into place.  So it wasn't really a constraint so much as a roll to see if Fate were favoring the next act of the play/stage of the romance (whether beneficial or perilous) or if, alternatively, we still had some issues to work through related to what the convincing was about.<br/><br/>As far as disagreements between us as players were concerned, we worked them out through discussion until we came to some type of consensus about what all potentially awesome or not-so-awesome things could result given all the possible choices our characters might make.  And of course, that's a lot easier to do when you only have to consider your own fun and that of one other player.  We both interacted with a lot of other players on the MUSH; but since our characters had to be very secretive, the romantic angle of our story was fairly self-contained overall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_390506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390506/#Comment_390506" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T03:32:25+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  3:32AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2012 3:33AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To use die-rolling to inspire narrative is nice. I've used it to give direction in sex-scenes; to tell us whether two characters making love will turn out to be a match made in heaven, or turn out to be no match at all ...<br/>- when doing that I let players roll dice first, and then they narrate what happens, guided by the result of the dice.<br/><br/>I've not done manipulation-, intrigue- or other kinds of conflicts mixed with sex-scenes. I've used it solely to focus on love and relationships, and to build moods. But then I have not done much sex in my games. The method described in the opening post is one I started using this fall, due to the special needs of the setting we are playing (a sensual elven setting). Before this fall I have had sporadic sex-scenes, both in classical fantasy games, and in modern rpgs, but nothing as methodic as the things I'm doing now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_390526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390526/#Comment_390526" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T07:46:24+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  7:46AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That could range from interesting to bizarre, depending on the game.

But when you make violent actions about what you're willing to do, you often run into the same 'intimacy' problems as you do with sexual ones.

All player characters are manly barbarians and very, um, well equipped. One of two major sub-routines, rules-wise, is laying women (the other is fighting). The rules are about seduction, not about the actual act, so you can absolutely fade to black before anything graphic happens, but I\u2019ve had several games in which things got very explicit. The whole tone of the game is of course humorous but this did not stop some of these scenes from becoming quite hot. So if you are interested in trying tacky and pornographic without taking yourself too serious, you might give it a shot.<br/><br/>When it comes to online roleplaying, I think there is a clear distinction between roleplaying where sex is only an ingredient as part of a story, and roleplaying where sex (IC) and arousal (OOC) is the whole purpose. The latter often also referred to as \u201ccyber sex\u201d. ;-) <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sickelf" title="sickelf"><img alt="sickelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sickelf">sickelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390978/#Comment_390978" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T20:53:49+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  8:53PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frank T - You made a game based on the Barbarian Queen series?
