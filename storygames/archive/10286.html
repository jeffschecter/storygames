As a threat looms over your village, a roaming Samurai with a troubled past enters the scene. Kagematsu. Your goal is to win Kagematsu\u2019s affections and guarantee a promise from him to defend the village. Otherwise you are all doomed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou try to win Kagematsu's affection with stolen glances, smiles, kind words, shared moments, secrets, touches, gifts, kisses, confessions of love, sex, and promises.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou roll your charm or innocence to gain affections. Winning a smile is easier than winning a kiss. And as you win affections, you can keep trying for more at the risk of losing everything you gained on your turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nRolling many dice can help you win an affection but also carries great risk. Every time you roll a 6 in the scene, it is set aside (and doesn't help you win affections). If you set aside three 6s in a scene, you do not gain Kagametsu's affection as the looming threat grows closer and disrupts the scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fail at gaining affection, you may try again using desperation. Threats, disdain, begging, questioning honor, challenging manhood, accusations of impropriety, ransoms, blackmail, and threats of suicide.<br/>\n<br/>\nKagematsu secretly notes if the affection was gained out of pity or love (completely based on roleplaying). Love makes gaining future affections easier. And in general you may only attempt an affection once. So it's best to earn love before attempting to elicit the promise (the hardest affection to gain). Because if everyone fails to gain the promise, the village is doomed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce Kagematsu agrees to defend the village, he rolls the highest love for a single townswoman against the townswoman's collective fear. Townswomen lower their fear by winning affections. And may choose to negate their fear completely at the end by sacrificing themselves.<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\nI have to run but I will post Actual Play as soon as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuick notes before I run:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Every issue I had the first time I played Kagematsu has been 100% fixed. I don't know if that is because the rules were revised (I bought the version from Gencon 2009) or if we were initially playing it differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Terry went out dancing so we lost our one present female player. So I ended up playing as Kagematsu as everyone decided I was the most feminine person at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The character sheet is difficult to use. If I have time I will help design a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We rolled three 6s in a scene at least 4 times! Which seems rare but made for great fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n- This is one of my newest favorite games! Tied with Missery Bubblegum.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228722/#Comment_228722" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T11:26:25+00:00" title="August 30, 2009 11:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kagematus is THE current benchmark for design in small press, short format RPGs.<br><br>If your writing isn't as clear,<br>If your layout isn't as simple,<br>If your mechanics aren't as elegant<br>Go back to your drawing board.<br><br>-L                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228755/#Comment_228755" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T13:06:14+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  1:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a pretty fucking strong recommendation. <br><br>Interesting.

Fat from years of success, Shinju\u2019s men were overtaken. Cowards, they fled. Rather than sully their blades further, the invaders dragged them into the ocean to be drowned like dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Shinju\u2019s boats missing or destroyed, Kagematsu, famed Samurai, was stranded. He began eagerly building his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nA scout from the invading force mistoke Kagematsu for one of Shinju\u2019s surviving men. Kagematsu dispatched the scout and calmly returned to crafting his boat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe townswomen took notice of Kagematsu's weapon mastery and began courting him to chain him to Shinju\u2019s fate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe townswomen were:<br/>\n<br/>\nYoko<br/>\n- soldier\u2019s daughter<br/>\n- favorites: cliff overlooking ocean, father\u2019s necklace<br/>\n- innocence 6<br/>\n- charm 1<br/>\n- fear 3<br/>\n- pity 1<br/>\n- love 6<br/>\n<br/>\nKaiko<br/>\n- tea house owner\u2019s wife<br/>\n- favorites: tea house, sick step mother<br/>\n- innocence 2<br/>\n- charm 5<br/>\n- fear 2<br/>\n- pity 4<br/>\n- love 4<br/>\n<br/>\nFiku<br/>\n- pearl farmer\u2019s wife<br/>\n- favorites: pearl farm, farm helper<br/>\n- innocence 2<br/>\n- charm 5<br/>\n- fear 6<br/>\n- pity 5<br/>\n- love 1<br/>\n<br/>\nKagematsu fell in love with Yoko and rolled 6 love vs. 11 fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one sacrificed themselves.

It felt like every time she tried to win Kagematsu\u2019s affection, the threat attacked.

Which was great!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Last time we played, the townswomen framed the scenes dictating where Kagematsu was. This felt awkward. We abandoned going around the table describing scenes and instead I described Kagematsu going about his business and told everyone to jump in with affection attempts. We still made sure everyone had equal spotlight (although it was sometimes confusing to remember who had not acted yet). Overall it worked great.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The character sheet was difficult to use. It was confusing which desperations were available vs. locked. And we abandoned writing down our fear on the character sheet since the number could go up and down within a scene. Instead we used tokens.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We had 2 ties and the townswomen opted to sacrifice their favorites to win. In general the favorites were used quite a bit to help describe the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The language in the book was very clear and easy to read. I read through it and understood everything in less than 20 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The right aligned headers were sometimes confusing. For example in the \u201cPlaying A Townswoman\u201d section. It was easy to miss.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I would have also preferred if procedures like \u201cdivide seven points\u201d and \u201cdescribe two of the following three things\u201d were called out in some way for reference. Some rules are bullet pointed while others are embedded in the longer text.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It was first unclear if Kagematsu discards 6s when he rolls during the confrontation. It says the townswomen discard 6s when rolling for fear. Although the example pages later clarified that Kagematsu does indeed discard 6s.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Everyone enjoyed the game. We would all play again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228867/#Comment_228867" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T07:03:51+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  7:03AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey John,<br><br>Awesome.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>- Every issue I had the first time I played Kagematsu has been 100% fixed.
