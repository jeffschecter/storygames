As I said in the <a>town cryer thread</a>, I'm using modified Cinematic Unisystem (CU) rules (Angel, Buffy, Army of Darkness) to do it.  CU is a system my players are well acquainted with and a lot of people are fans of how quick and smooth it is to play.  Some people have said Classic Unisystem would make more sense and I can certainly see their point.<br/><br/>The Traits and most Perks were lifted very much from the Fallout games, adapted to CU.  CU's existing Qualities were shoehorned into Perks and given ranks appropriate to their point cost.  I always loved getting a new Perk choice as I played through the game.  To me it was a satisfying reward so I wanted to replicate that kind of feel.<br/><br/>Initially I ran Fallout without Keys until <a>Mark Causey suggested the idea</a>.  In my opinion, it's actually a good idea to replace the standard Drama Point system which is loosely tied to setting.  Well, at least the "Quotable Quotes" and "Support Your Local Champion" bits.<br/><br/><a>The Rules adaptation</a><br/><br/><a>The Character Sheet</a><br/><br/><a>Equipment Guide</a><br/><br/><a>Fallout Keys</a><br/><br/><a>The GM Utility: Cinematic Unisystem Fallout Factory</a><br/>(Windows, requires .NET 1.1 framework, still a work in progress)<br/><br/>As for the game in actual play, I ran the game (same setting, set up, and scenario) for two different groups.  First for my Wednesday group, a strong Story Game crowd that has played quite a few systems, including Dogs in the Vineyard, The Shadow of Yesterday, Polaris, All Flesh Must Be Eaten, and probably a dozen games I can't remember off the top of my head.  After that I ran it for my Tuesday group, my closest friends with an informal play style that can probably be described as "Cheetoist".  This group started with D&amp;D and has gone on to play Buffy, GURPS Traveller, Heavy Gear, Mutants &amp; Masterminds, and Paranoia.<br/><br/>The game was set on the east coast, an unexplored area in the Fallout series.  The first group decided to locate their home town in Bethesda but named it Thesda.  It was part farming village, part underground Vault.  I located the second group's town (only a farming village) in the same place for simplicity's sake, but they named it, um, Lower New RoboSquirreltonVilleShireBourgh City District 4 "The Meadow".  Yeah.  The setup was that the town's primary source of water, a small river, had dwindled to just a trickle.  Without it, no crops and no coolant for the Vault's reactor.  The characters were the volunteers who offered to follow the river north to determine the source of the problem.<br/><br/>I have to admit, running this with my Wednesday group was intimidating.  The players are very experienced indie/story gamers.  I'm not great at creating original content on the spot; with that kind of set up, I'm better at building up stuff in more of a collaborative fashion.  As a result, I tried to do a lot of preparation beforehand and I built some tools to help when I need/want to introduce random elements into the game spontaneously.  This ended up not being very successful in my opinion.  In hindsight, I think my pacing was pretty poor.  When it came to the group accomplishing their primary mission, I'd intended for the group to weigh their options but it ended up being lopsided enough that really only one choice was feasible for them.  At least one of the players hadn't played the Fallout games and I kept forgetting to really give a sense of the setting in my descriptions.  I ran it like a slow-building campaign where characters power-up slowly (like the videogame), even though this group doesn't stick to games long-term.  We have more of a history of Bringing the Awesome rather quickly and in hindsight the game ended up feeling kind of padded.  The few combats I threw at them seemed generally unchallenging because I was still getting a feel for power levels and I didn't want to overwhelm them.  In the end, we haven't finished the scenario due to scheduling conflicts.<br/><br/>My Tuesday group approaches most RPGs a little like a board game -- more of a focus on winning than on creating a deep story.  Reception to the Keys felt a bit lukewarm, but then this was really their first encounter with this type of mechanic.  Most took a single Key for their character and the bulk of the Keys got little to no play during our sessions.  I did correct one mistake though.  Upon the characters discovering the root cause of their initial problem (the town's small river had dried up), they were approached by a third party that offered them the ability to resolve it quickly but illicitly.  Even though in the end took the same approach as the first group, at least there wasn't just the illusion of choice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
