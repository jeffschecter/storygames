                    Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
During the '90s I did some development and playtesting for RPGs, and was pretty disenchanted with the whole industry.  I continued gaming on a personal basis, but retreated from contributing in the larger community and industry.  I went from being an avid collector of any RPG in print to focusing on the older systems I owned.  Later around 2001, I started promoting gaming on a local mailing list and began designing games to eventually release.  I didn't frequent Bulletin Boards, or Forums, or anything.  I worked in isolation from other designers and the industry in general.  So being here has been a little bit of a system shock.  A lot of the indie-games-in-your-face-huwah contributed to this system shock, and the semi-canonization of certain demagouges in the gaming field resulting in the polarization of camps that were always there but now are entrenched.  Reflecting on the time of isolation from these aspects of the gaming field has led me to both appreciate my retreat and to be thankful I discovered this site to be aware of community concerns.  I am glad that my existing games were developed before I stumbled upon these aspects.  This forum has generated ideas for other games for me, some of them even in-your-face-indie-attitude games, but I personally think the venom in some of the this-is-the one-true-way ideaologies is not generating positive results for game development.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.                </div>

                            To Jason:  This was neither intended as an indictment of everyone in game design nor on this forum.  As an analogy though, there are some pretty obvious ripples in the pond from the stones thrown about.<br/>
<br/>
To Ben:  I put this in the Little Ideas area, because I personally see the polarization of the gaming community as detrimental to gaming as a whole.  There seems to be a drive to legislate opinions based on these camps or schools of thought.  If you want to discuss possible positive effects, that I may be overlooking in my culture shock, from circular arguments that are subjective from my point of view, please feel free.  The hidden truth that I think everyone seems to be missing is that designers and companies cannot mandate strict uses of their designs by players.  I am working up a hypothesis regarding this and design that I'll post later.<br/>

<p>No, there just doesn't seem to be a discussion topic, here.  It's an opinion piece, which is fine, but I don't think that tacking "so what's your opinion" on the end makes it discussable.  That said, I'm out.</p>

                            Gryph - I can see where you might feel that way from being "out of the loop" for the time period you describe.  However, there's enormous and enormously fertile crossover between mainstream and indie gamers and games, for most ordinary definitions of "indie" (this is not an invitation to pop open that debate again).  It's still fairly rare, though getting less so, for a mainstream game to pick up on a thread laid down by an indie game, but gamers are getting more highly attuned to social issues, game focus, and other indie-game booster ideas.  Some indie games have been a great success in the mainstream gamer community and are highly critically acclaimed and (most importantly) played by thousands of people.  So from a practical point of view your perception is dead wrong.<br>
<br>
What you are seeing is simple branding, just as you might in any other hobby, and as you no doubt saw prior to your withdrawal from the world of gaming.  Some people get a piece of themselves tied up in the label on the package because they like what's in the package. You have done this at some point in your life, it's a natural thing and marketers pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to try to figure out how to get you to do this.                        </br></br></div>

                            I'm just trying to understand exactly what it is that you personally feel I'm dead wrong about in this.  Discussions around the "Brain Damage" opinion errupt periodically from what I've seen and there certainly seems to be a degree subtext unstated in many conversations.  I see no intrinsic benefit to these encampments of ideas.  It seems detrimental to the community as a whole.  And it is less about traditional RPG and indie RPG cross-over and more about vain attempts legislating how people enjoy themselves.  At a core level of this particular hobby, the consumers of the products are more co-creators than anything.  Designers don't have control over the application of their rules sets.  Designers only provide a medium for expression.<br/>
<br/>
We create the equivalent of paint and the only thing we can do is put a warning label that says don't eat the product or you'll get sick, but we can not dictate the applications the paint is used for.  Someone may indeed eat it.  Many of these discussions have boiled down to: I once saw a picture painted with Paradigm Oils and I hated it.  Those paints created a dysfunction with the artist that is apparent in his style and subject matter and I'll never paint with them, and anyone who uses Paradigm Oils does so out of either ignorance or self-loathing.<br/>
<br/>
The personal choice to not use that particular paint brand, or paint in that style, or on that subject matter, or go to a showing of the artist-in-question's works is acceptable based on the person's personal beliefs.  It's the dismissive and devaluing attitude towards everyone who would consider using that paint or looking at that particular artist's work for any reason that is disturbing to me.  It goes beyond bias.  I'm looking for anything beneficial from it, and seeing nothing but negativity.                        </div>

But it is not just the old guard that are claiming to be the one way to gaming happiness.  I agree that diversity is important.  It should be embraced.  What I am seeing is the equivalent of sectarianism, not diversity.                        </div>

Perhaps, I have a skewed perspective.  But, there are, to my eyes that if I say something about a game mechanic, then it implies that I am this.  If I say something about character immersion it indicates I fall here.  I don't like labels, so I perhaps am jousting at windmills in quixotic glee or maybe people who have been around the forums longer are just used to these sets of assumptions and know better than I when to speak.                        </div>

                            Thom, I don't feel like that at all.  In my experience, people are free to talk about whatever they want or can have whatever play preferences they like without necessarily feeling like they are part of a seperate group that is better than anyone else.  Heck, I mostly design hippie freeform stuff nowadays, but I love the hell out of John Harper's crunchy-ass <i>Agon</i>.  Likewise, designers that would never have attempted something like Meg Baker's <i>1001 Nights</i> are tripping all over themselves talking about how cool it is.  Also, many of us have big crushes on mainstream games.  Clinton has a thing about <i>Blue Rose</i> that is kinda frightening.  As does Shreyas for <i>Exalted</i>.  And a lot of folks would totally jump on some hot d20 action in minutes, given a fun group to play it with.  Dude, I grew up playing <i>Robotech</i>, <i>Rifts</i>, and <i>In Nomine</i>.  It's hard for me to be a snob considering my early experiences playing a cat-person who piloted a transforming hovertank.  I don't usually write or play games like that anymore, but that doesn't mean I don't understand what makes them hella fun.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I would encourage you to talk to individual indie designers about the games they dig, respect, or are inspired by.  I think the breadth and depth of their interests might surprise you.                        </div>

                            We're not talking about anything here that doesn't happen every single time people discuss things on the Internet - especially things that people feel strongly about. Yes, people who have never seen your face and disagree with your words will sometimes classify you and mark you as Other before their forebrains even kick in. Yes, that sucks. No, not much can be done about it; the key is to remember it's there and correct for it. Correcting for it means taking things less personally, which means assuming good will unless you have a good reason not to.<br/>
<br/>
In short: implications are easy to see even when they aren't necessarily there. Also, the things you like are not you; we all know that, but we all forget from time to time.                        </div>

SCREW THE GAME SNOBS, MAN. You don't need to "prove" yourself here with what games you play. Your interest in indie comics certainly suggests you have an interesting background to bring to the table, and you can belong here as much as anyone else.<br/><br/>(So, that's one way of saying, "Welcome to Story Games.")                        </div>

                            Man, I am awash in sympathy.<br/><br/>I have, through Dexcon and Gencon, met a bunch of the people in this and the Forge community and they have, to a man (or woman) been a pleasure to meet.  I like them and I think well of them, and that takes the edge off the fact that I have shared (and occasionally still do share)  most of the sentiments and concerns that you list.  What this community is can only be described as a fuzzy and sometimes troubling thing indeed.<br/><br/>But with that in mind, I can point to the two things that keep me from stressing too much.  The first is, as mentioned, meeting folks and thinking of them as individuals.  <br/><br/>The second is, frankly, I like it better here. I like the post-diaspora atmosphere of Story Games, and while the Forges gravity can never be entirely escaped, this is a pretty distant orbit, and it works for me.  So much so that when the answer to a question here is a link to something very long and involved at the Forge, I die a little inside. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  This isn't the Forge, and a lot of what rocks has grown out of that fact.<br/><br/>Anyway, I sympathize with your concerns.  We went round and round on this early on, and I still firmly feel that there _are_ some entrenched One-True-Wayisms floating about, though others will certainly argue otherwise.  Thankfully, they are mindfully held, and for all that I think you will find them, I do not think you will encounter any which serve as an _end_ point to conversation.  Similarly, opinions on things like the value of drift, the utility of narration, player/game types and the role of the GM are far from monolithic.  (The one exception is arrogance.  You'll find that here in spades. Why, I myself have arrogance enough to power the mighty computers behind this board for generations to come, and I'm sure you will find similar sentiments among the, erm, *lesser* lights.)<br/><br/>But here's the flip side.  People here _do_ like one another (in general) and are enthusiastic about what they do.  Mostly, this is an awesome thing, for reasons which are, I hope, obvious, but hell, it also has its problems.  Cliquishness and pedestals are constant threats, but perhaps most importantly, when you talk about how bad some game/behavior/theory is, you need to be careful that it doesn't sound like you're busting on the guy behind it.  From the receiving end, it can feel like a fierce defense of dogma, but in reality, it's people sticking up for a friend, which may explain why the knuckles get bloodied up so fast.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's kind of intimidating, and that enthusiastic closeness (coupled with numerous folks who very clearly liked it better when the club was smaller) can be off putting - it's really easy to feel like you're watching the cool kids club.   I know that's a perception I wrangled with up until...well, I'll let you know when I stop.  But what's important to note is that it's (mostly) not true - the community really would rather have you on the inside than the outside, and they demand no kool'aid be drunk, only that you be thoughtful and polite, or barring that, entertaining.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is much farther into how I view the world than I meant to go, but I figured you should know that there's no universal denial of the warts so much as a willingness to go forward, warts and all.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>
