                    So here's the thing:  I had a board-gaming night, and I got huge attendance and lots of fun, and it's massively exciting to be able to sit down with a group of people and have all the materials ready to play a game in about fifteen minutes (yeah, we played Memoir '44) and then play the game to completion and get a huge pile of good, focussed stuff out of that minimal investment.  Because nobody had to commit to anything, or prepare anything, I got a lot of people showing up to play.<br/><br/>I'm not the first to talk about the benefits of a game that can generate fun from a standard start, but just to reiterate:  <b>I want that.</b><br/><br/>But here's the thing.  I've played long-running games, where people come back and revisit the same characters, and where we grow to love the characters and want to see them again.  And <b>I want that too</b>.<br/><br/>So I was lying in bed pondering.  I'd love a roleplaying game where you spent the first ten or fifteen minutes quickly generating characters, and those characters were (in a mechanical sense) <i>consumed</i> in the process of play.  The work you put into them would all pay off, and you'd know when you were done because all your prep work would have been burnt up, leaving some end condition.  That doesn't mean necessarily that the character would be burnt to a crisp, but that the resources you started the game with, to represent that character, would be transformed in a non-reversible way.<br/><br/>And lying in bed, thinking, I said to myself "Well, that would make a lot of sense for some manga ... a lot of them do an episode with a set of characters, and then move on to a whole new set of characters.  But it wouldn't represent ongoing manga, where you do an episode with a set of characters, then do another episode with the same set of characters.  I mean, it would be pretty strange to make up Hitoshi, play until all her resources were consumed, and then say 'Okay!  Now I'm going to use the character creation system to make another Hitoshi, who has resources for the <i>next</i> story I want to tell with her.  Heh.  Goofy."<br/><br/>And then, of course, in the morning I woke up and thought "Oh my God."<br/><br/>Why not?  Why not have every session of a game start with character creation?  If you're playing discontinuous stories then you create a set of characters you've never seen before.  If you're playing a continuous story then you create <i>the same characters</i> that you've been playing with ... but of course you have the freedom to create them <i>in a different way</i>!<br/><br/>Yes, Hitoshi is (say) an ace student, in some broader sense ... but if you don't want to put that ability in mechanically this time then it just tells us straight up that tonight we're not telling a story about her ace student abilities.  No big.  We'll concentrate on the flags you've thrown down for tonight.  Then if, next week, you create a Hitoshi who is entirely focussed on academics then again we know what to concentrate on.<br/><br/>Character advancement?  Who <b>needs</b> character advancement with this system?  If the character creation system would let you make any character within the genre then it will let you make Season 1 Buffy and it will let you make Season 7 Buffy.  So make the one you need.<br/><br/>Moreover, look what this does to the social situation.  If (no, <i>when</i>!) I write <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> this way, look at the type of thing it becomes, socially!  I can say "Cool!  I win Jungle Speed again!  Playing with my feet!  Okay, let's play something else.  How about a game of Misery Bubblegum?"  We make characters, play for an hour, and we've told a cool story.  Excellent!  Now we can play Puerto Rico.  Then, next time people get together, Samantha can say "You know, I've been thinking about poor little Jessie Joy.  I want to see what happens to her next," and we can play <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> again and find out.  Or we can play it with entirely different characters because it's a fun game.  Or we can play Carcassone.<br/><br/>In case you can't tell, I am very, very stoked about this idea.  It's like an indie-mentality for campaign-creation:  Do a little thing that you can do purely with your current resources (these people, an hour of time) but leave the hooks so that if more resources <i>gravitate</i> to that ("Hey!  Let's play again, and see what happens next!") you can seamlessly use the same structure in order to grow the game into a campaign that is precisely as long-term as anyone cares to make it.<br/><br/><b>I am doing this.</b>  I'd really love some advice to help me, and questions to challenge and provoke me, and praise.  I always love the adulation.                </div>

                            Interestingly enough, Mark Causey and I were exploring <b>this very thing</b> not even 10 days ago after our Burning Wheel thing. However, we weren't discussing it so much as The One Rule to Create a New Game Around, but rather a set of modular house rules that could be applied to any system with some elbow grease.<br/><br/>It started because we are playing Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>I wanted to have a guy competent with Picking Locks (we're an all-thief campaign, and I'm th only one with the real bigbad sneaky skills). To be competent, you really have to boost up those stats and play out character generation, otherwise you'd just end up with a Lock Picking of "2", which is enough to try to pick locks... and fail constantly until you've played and played and picked and picked for weeks to build up that skill.  I did trick out lifepath-picking, and have a Picking Locks of 6 or something (if I constantly FoRK in Lockwise, etc), which is a rather competent- even Awesome- amount of skill. So awesome: When I pick a lock, because of my choices, I'm gonna be pretty successful at it.<br/><br/>Then, about halfway through the first episode, I realized that, all along I knew this was gonna be a socio-political game, imagine AMBER in the upper eschelon of a  Thieves' Guild. What the fuck, by my chargen choices I just showed the GM that I want to have my character all about Picking Locks and shit. And I totally am not interested in it. I want there to be Some Locks, and I want to successfully (or have a high chance anyway) pick them, but I want to do other stuff too. Maybe have one adventure where I'm all over the lockpicking, a few where I'm going all Prince of Persia climbing the spires of the city and fighting stuff, and the rest I'm all being my social self.<br/><br/>So after the game Mark and I were hashing it out, and what we came up with was an idea for a game mod (which we'll probably first apply to a variant of The Shadow of Yesterday or d20 to see how it goes) where you do get character generation and the like, just like normal, but with perhaps fewer points.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the campaign or whatever you would choose if there are any bizarre/specialty/out there skills or abilities that you use. You have to at least choose a few points in them up front at the first character generation, to prevent the whole, "Oh, didn't I mention? I also have PSYCHIC POWERS." next session "AND I was trained in Hokuto Shinken Ultimate Battle Fist." next session "Did I mention that I trained with the Magestrike Ultimus Mage's Guild for 10 years?" etc. So if you have something "special" (magic, psi, etc for that campaign world) you have to take at least a little of it up front (but you can learn it later over the campaign).<br/><br/>Now, to get into d20 terms, what we were thinking of is something like this: Round up all your points that you need to spend on character generation: Say, for example, you had like "30 skill points" and "7 feats" total available at your level. In d20, I would do something like this: You have to spend 1/3 of your total skill points in characer generation as normal. Like a normal D&amp;D character, these don't change. But then, every session, you are allowed to take the rest of the points and distribute them however you see fit. And you can choose any new Feat progressions you want (this week I'm badass with my axe, next week I decide to go all dual-wield, the week after that I load up on all social Feats, etc).<br/><br/>So in this way, you have a "core" of abilities that follow you around (that 1/3-1/2 of your set skill points: This tells us that there's some things about your character that don't change, and shows the GM, at the core, what kind of guy you think your character is overall). But session to session, in many cases there won't be too much wild change but the players are free to make wild changes to the "free skill points/feats/charms/abilities/pools" in any way they want to.<br/><br/>Actually, it would be preferable to, int he last 10 minutes of your Today's Session, draw to a close, and do the reallocate then, telling the GM and other players how you're reallocating. The GM takes the characters home and thinks of what to put in the next scenario.<br/><br/>Something like this could be applied to everything from D&amp;D to Exalted to HeroQuest to TSOY or whatever. I'm not sure about Burning Wheel, though; it would seem to miss the point of the lifepath creation, but for the rest such a system would slide into place with an audiable "click", I think.<br/><br/>Thoughts, Tony? This is very much a Traditional'd-Out version of what you were discusssing, as it's not a total free-for-all of completely rebuilding your character each session, and you also have that "character core" that sticks with the character". And it's more geared for concurrent play, not so much as you're wanting the "This week we play D&amp;D, next week we play another game... and four weeks later we return to D&amp;D" etc<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Andy:  I think it nicely highlights that the same technique can address different questions.<br/><br/>Yes, the stuff you're talking about doesn't deal with the social questions I was thinking about.  But you're using "recreate your character on the fly" to <i>encourage</i> specialties that have spotlight times (by letting you play one session of Lockpick Frenzy) rather than <i>discourage</i> them (by saying "Hey, if you ever want that one session then you've got to dedicate a huge pile of resources to something that will only ever be used in that one session").<br/><br/>Now I will admit that I am <i>quite</i> wierded out by the prospect of doing this in Burning Wheel which has ... well ... a not-quick character generation system.  Or maybe it's just not quick because I'm not sufficiently practiced in it.  How much time are you expecting to be spent making the new characters each week?                        </div>

                            What if the burnable resources were at the player level and not the character level for the most part? Like, hrm, a big ol' pile of dice, that once rolled by the player, are no longer used for that game?<br/><br/>Also, what about recording precedent? It's not quite like character advancement, but it is a record of things a character has done previously.<br/><br/>Oh, and one final thought. Session one, you build a cool character the way you want. Grand. In session three, I decicde to revisit the character, by my vision of them and play them. How could precedent come into play here, assuming that it has some kind of mechanical importance.<br/><br/>As a suggestion- Could you hash out a few pregens that then get modified/created at the beginning of each session? I mean basically as a thought experiment, not that no one would ever create a brand new character.                        </div>

                            Bob:  Re: Precedent ... if I win Puerto Rico, like <b>totally dominate</b> the game, what advantage carries over to the next game of Puerto Rico?  None.  Likewise, if I lose big-time, what carries over?  Nothing.  That's exactly where I stand on precedent, in terms of mechanics, in this model.  It doesn't carry over, at all, in mechanical terms.<br/><br/>If I, as a player, choose to always play a build-heavy strategy in PR, and I get really good at it, and keep at it, that's cool.  That carries over, but outside the game mechanics.  I'm pretty sure precedent would carry over in much the same way.  I'd choose not to give Buffy "cowardly," "weak," and "simpering" traits in episode <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2337&amp;Mode=like">#37</a> because episodes <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231-36&amp;Mode=like">#1-36</a> established her as being buff as ten buff men.  But I might well not give her any combat skills in episode <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2337&amp;Mode=like">#37</a>, simply because I don't want to do combat with her in that episode.  That doesn't mean she's not combat capable (in some abstract sense) it just means that her combat skills, for better or worse, will have no impact on the story.<br/><br/>Has this addressed your thoughts on precedence?<br/><br/>Pregenerated characters that get modified ... sounds like templates.  That <i>might</i> be a way that I go after it.  I think that the character creation should be part of a group effort:  my choices should effect the character you can make, and vice versa, and it should all be tied in with creating the world.<br/><br/>Yes, the world should be created each session too.  Some episodes of Buffy are in a world where the High School is prominent and important.  Some episodes of Buffy are in a world where the High School might as well not exist (and that's even before they blow it up).  Create the world you're going to play in that evening, then play in it.                        </div>

Actually, that's the rub; This system wouldn't work well for games with long character generation, like say GURPS (at least, it wouldn't be fast by any means, and I think the system HAS to be fast to be strong).<br/><br/>And further, the double-rub is that it probably can't be done in Burning Wheel and still maintain the "BW-Ness". Even though the discussion came up after a session of Burning Wheel, we're not going to implement it for Burning Wheel, but rather another game. We could do as I said above and I could just, y'know, next week lower Lockpicking from 6 to 2, and raise Persuade from 2 to 6. However, that pretty much takes an elephant-sized shit on the whole process of Lifepathing in Burning Wheel. I mean, seriously, at that point you might as well be playing another game.  And I totally wouldn't want to redo lifepaths every session, that would be worse than burning the last GURPS character sheet and remaking the same character in a new way from scratch.<br/><br/>So, Burning Wheel... not so much. D&amp;D or HeroQuest? Yeah, I smell the possibility there.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            What if the precedent simply was some sort of record of previous history? Non-mechanical, but meant to aid playing the role?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm really badly misunderstanding what you're getting at, though. I was under the impression that you were talking about having some of th character carry over between sessions, but allowing/requiring a new build for the character mechanically each session to emphasize what was important to that particular session.<br/><br/>Am I on the right track, or completely off? My example would be a well known comic book character who is now in the hands of a new writer. Precedent isn't completely dropped, but the new writer might have some very different things they want to do with that old character this issue.                        </div>

                            Andy: There are <i>some things</i> from the HERO/GURPs model that would work much better in this type of thing though:  Specifically, I'm thinking about disadvantages.<br/><br/>"Hunted:  VIPER, 8 or less"?  No, no, no.  There is no eight or less.  Your disadvantage would be "VIPER hates my guts, and I'm handing the GM a whole hunk of resources to make VIPERs hatred of me present and powerful in this particular episode."  If, in the long-term, VIPER is only an occasional enemy then you only take that disadvantage occasionally.  But on the sessions when you take it (or, conversely, maybe the GM gives it to you ... depends on the end system) it <b>will</b> come up.<br/><br/>I love how much clearer that makes the flags.  "DNPC:  Mary Jane," plus "Hunted:  Green Goblin," plus (for once) "Ability:  Support of the city" rather than "Disad:  Bad PR" ... you look at that and you <b>know</b> roughly how that session's going to play out.                        </div>

How would this work differently from say, a game of <i>The Pool</i>, where you got to reassign your 15 dice at the start of each session, but you kept the backstory?<br/>

I mean, I guess realistically, they don't need to say anything at all. I just like the precedence part.<br/><br/>Also, the little game I was working on that I've back burnered worked a lot like that, because there were no character sheets or anything that really defined characters mechanically at all. All of the mechanics are up at the player level. And yeah, they're pretty agmostic. Precedence does inform later games though, primarily about what nuggets ( usually characters, but sometimes locations, too) to use in the current story/game/session.<br/><br/>Mind you, what I was working on was to play with kids with toys, so I'm not sure the same method would be of much interest to adults...                        </div>

                            Stoning for heresy not required - I was trying to find a simple example to illustrate a point, and it flopped - my bad, not yours.<br/>
<br/>
So, let's stat Hitoshi in the Pool. Minus the backstory, here's how she might look for Session 1, which is focused primarily on romance:<br/>
<br/>
Cute geeky looks +2 (costs 4 dice)<br/>
Ace student +0 (no cost)<br/>
Knows kung fu +1 (costs 1 die)<br/>
Looking for romance +2 (costs 4 dice)<br/>
<br/>
6 dice left over<br/>
<br/>
Now, in standard Pool, the scores would stay the same between sessions, unless they are bought up with 'experience'. What I'm suggesting is that you could just reassign the points for Session 2, which is (say) about trying to find the answer to a strange zombie plague that's affecting the students at Hitoshi's school.<br/>
<br/>
Cute geeky looks +0 (no cost)<br/>
Ace student +2 (costs 4 dice)<br/>
Knows kung fu +0 (no cost)<br/>
Looking for a cure to the plague +2 (costs 4 dice)<br/>
<br/>
7 dice left over<br/>
<br/>
(As the romance subplot has been resolved, I'm crossing it off. If it still had legs, we could keep it at +0)<br/>
<br/>
Does this make more sense?                        </div>

I want to further propose something Tony.

                            Doug,<br><br>I imagine you could tweak <i>The Pool</i> to do something similar, but Tony's got two major things going on here, only one of which I've seen talked about much.<br><br>1. Re-create characters every session.  This is an awesome idea, and it's probably possible with any fast-character-generation system out there (<i>Primetime Adventures</i>, <i>HeroQuest</i>, <i>Capes</i>, maybe even <i>Sorcerer</i> if you were practiced at it).  Note that this is, interestingly, similar to something that <i>With Great Power</i> does, but on a shorter time-scale.  WGP allows you to make notes about your character's potential Aspects, but only some of them matter during each story arc.  Between arcs you can totally rewrite your character to focus on different/new Aspects.<br><br>2. Short play.  Tony's also talking about a game that <i>reliably</i> takes an hour or two to play, and one in which the mechanics signal the end of the game.  This seems like a much harder proposition to me, but it also seems like a much more important and cool thing to do.  Look at those games I mentioned above that would let you rewrite characters every session, with one exception they all just keep playing until the group decides to stop.  In fact, the only game I can think of off-hand that has a built in time-limit on play is <i>Primetime Adventures</i>.  When the Budget pool runs dry, and all fanmail is spent and removed from play, it's time to wrap up the session.<br><br>But simply modifying <i>Primetime Adventures</i>' Budget economy isn't going to cut it here, I don't think.  Because Tony's trying to pack two complex things in here: 1) The game needs to reliably end itself mechanically after X real time (in this case, somewhere around 60 minutes).  2) The game needs to reliably produce the standard plot cycle in this time: rising action, climax, falling action.<br><br>It's that second thing that's hard.  <i>Primetime Adventures</i> relies on the Producer to regulate total real-time play through Budget expenditures (if the game is approaching climax and your Budget pool is full, start spending lots of Budget, if you need to stretch things out then don't spend any extra Budget).  This game that Tony's talking about needs to reliably end on time <i>and</i> reliably produce satisfying story.<br><br>Tony: I'm with you all the way here.  I want this game too!  The only problem is that I'm not sure how to accomplish both halves of that second thing.<br><br/>(In case it's not clear, I've been thinking about this topic a lot recently...)<br/><br/>EDIT: cross-posted with Bob, Doug, Joe, and Tony!<br/><br/>Thomas                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hey, Tony.<br/><br/>This is actually one of the central pieces to <em>Sons of Liberty</em>, my way-backburnered game for Q4 07.  You play historical figures -- George Washington, Ben Franklin, Paul Revere, etc.  "Character Generation" is a matter of picking from a list of "favored circumstances" and applying them as triggers for abilities.  So my Ben Franklin has five cards in his hand when he's in Congress and your Paul Revere has five cards in his hand when he's on horseback.  Each session of the game is self-contained, a battle in the much greater war.  Next time you get together to play, maybe you play the same figures again, but you still do character generation, so this time my Ben Franklin has five cards in his hand when he's tinkering, and you're playing George Washington this time, and he's got five cards in his hand when he's at Valley Forge.  And you play another battle in the war -- maybe it's a later battle, maybe it's a prior battle.  In the end, it barely matters at all.  The important thing is that this battle, Valley Forge will be all important and Ben Franklin will be tinkering -- and the GM doesn't even have to thread that into the prep, since the players are going to be pushing in that direction since it gets them more cards.<br/><br/>I'm hoping to hit the same target you are, Tony -- set up and play in fifteen minutes; roleplay for a few hours; put the game away and know that it's available for infinite and casual replay any time you want to.  The other bit that you haven't mentioned is that you don't even need the same set of players for each session.  So in game one you have Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, and by game two Frodo and Sam have wandered off, but Merry and Pippin can pick up the game with Gimli and Legolas.  Continuity is strictly optional.  Even if you want to play it "traditionally" with a storyline and whatever, if somebody's missing and you want to play a session, hell, do a flashback, do a flashforward, do some battle that has one fewer figure in it.  It still plays just fine, and shouldn't disrupt your precious story.  Again, the important thing is that the session is fun to play right then and there.  Stitching things together into a larger narrative is beyond the scope of the game.  Do it in your leisure time. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>In regards to the questions about precedence and the 'core character' and stuff, guys, you really don't need it.  Character resources on the sheet are the substance of the character.  The <em>essence</em> of the character is going to stay the same in casual play; if you really got a bee in your bonnet, maybe you push really hard to redefine the essence, but hey -- the game allows you to redefine the essence of a character if you want to?  <em>Rock on!</em> </div>

                            Thomas: very few boardgames end precisely after a certain period of time: even if there are tight restrictions on length of game (for example, only 5 turns), the speed of the players will vary. So, I think that as long as a session takes say, 45 minutes on average, that ensure that 90% of games will fit into an hour, and the remaining 10% are either good enough that the players will want to continue, or the game's going badly and it's a good time to stop.<br/>
<br/>
So, a diminishing economy may fit the bill nicely enough.<br/>
<br/>
Tony: We've talked about <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> before, so I've got no problem trying that on for size. So how about this one: those dice you give to the other players doesn't just give them influence over your character; it's a resource that lets them throw all sorts of unpleasant shit at you. When they run out of dice to throw at you, game's over. There's your diminishing resource. But what about pacing?                        </div>

                            Doug,<br><br>You're right about timing, I think an average is perfectly fine.  And you're right about a diminishing economy too, but I do want to note that I don't think <i>Primetime Adventures</i>' economy, specifically, will work well because it relies on players for pacing (rather than mechanics).<br><br>Heck, here's a quick modification of <i>The Pool</i> that might work.  You get two pools for chargen, one for fixed traits and one your pool (instead of spending from your pool for fixed traits, this means everyone has roughly the same in fixed traits and precisely the same pool).  Once every character's pool has been emptied (via the regular mechanic) the game is over, or needs to be wrapped up, or whatever.<br/><br/>My guess is that that would produce relatively reliable pacing in terms of tme.  The question is, would it produce good narrative pacing?  That's the part I'm not sure about.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm finding it very amusing that you're thinking of this now, when IMHO [i]Capes[/i] is just about perfect for this.  Indeed, I was thinking the other day about the fact that most supers in Capes seem to have no abilities that would tie into their secret identity... but then realized that the most Capes-like way of handling a secret identity would be to create it as another character!  You could then use a Conflict to "change identity" to your super-self.<br/><br/>Indeed, the click-and-lock system makes it easy to create a new version of your character -- if you want your character to be psycho for a session, just create "psycho-X" as a new character, with a different set of Attitudes and Styles (and maybe even Powers).<br/><br/>It strikes me as well that Sorcerer does this to some extent, with the "when you resolve your Kicker, you can rewrite your character" rule.  But Sorcerer doesn't seem to me to be as suited to a "quick" game as Capes.                        </div>

                            I love this concept.  I love it so much I registered just to comment on it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the question here is what is the tail and what is the dog?  Does character define plot or does plot define character?<br/>
<br/>
If character defines plot, you make up the characters at the start and see what plot results.  So, I could give Buffy the trait "Lost her powers" and the episode "Helpless" might result.<br/>
<br/>
If plot defines character, you just start with blank sheets...or whatever carryover you decide to have...and then form traits throughout the course of play.  In this example, during play, Giles gives Buffy the injection which temporarily disables her powers and then the player says, "I take 'Lost her powers' as a trait."<br/>
<br/>
This discussion seems to assume the first choice, and maybe that will ultimately prove to be the better one, but I feel like I should at least bring up the second option as a possibility.  It has the advantage that the beginning of session character creation disappears entirely.  You create by playing.  I like that.  It certainly is a way to make character creation a group effort instead of an individual exercise.  On the other hand, this makes the game less driven by character and charater more driven by the game.  You don't get that moment at the beginning to say "I want this to be important" that you get when you assign traits to the character initially.  That does seem like a loss.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there is a middle ground, a way to get that initial kick at the beginning of the session, but also to adapt your character to fit where the game is going in the middle of the session.<br/>
<br/>
Well, those are my initial thoughts on the subject, for what they are worth.<br/>

                            Okay, sneak peek:  The character traits you choose are going to be on index cards (of course!) and some of them are going to be issues that you can <i>potentially</i> address over the course of playing the game.  When you address them, depending upon how you address them, they turn into new aspects of your character.  So that's where you get to customize.<br/><br/>But odds are, you're going to end the game without the resources to clear all of your cards.  You're going to end with cards that you've tried to address, and failed.  And then the game's just going to end.  They don't carry over, they don't do anything, they just weigh on your conscience.<br/><br/>You've played Puerto Rico, right Eric?  You know when you end the game without being able to ship that <i>one last massive pile of corn</i>?  That's going to happen in this game.                        </div>
