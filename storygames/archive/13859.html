And a hell of a lot nicer than what I could do by myself.

That's all on you. The gaming "industry" is all about production costs like printing, shipping, and storage. A $50 board game will cost $8-11 per game to print, plus ship, plus store, plus market. If you print 5000 copies of that game, you're looking at not turning a profit, until you've sold 3500 of those. And all of that cost is in the production cycle. Only about 5% of your cost is overhead and other 5% is editing, art, graphics, etc. Which you never pay again, if you re-print the game. Which is why the "industry" loves evergreen products like Munchkin and Gloom and Ticket to Ride.<br/><br/>Btw. Sexy cards.
