                    OK. I don't know big crappola about copyright law or IP rights. I know contract negotiations from doing design work, but not really the matter of protecting my own rights.<br/><br/>This contest is going to be a weird grey area, wherein really two creators are both owners of a project. I would really love it if someone who was better acquainted with copyrighting could figure out something that would insure this project is free of dickery and as no-hassle as possable. This is what i would most like:<br/><br/>Easy to use, include, and something that blanket covers all the sheets. Put them all in the public domain? Creative commons them? I'm posting all of the entries to my personal webspace, is there some sort of web copyright thing we can do? <br/><br/>The games however should be retained by their creators (clearly). <br/><br/>Maybe this will preclude people from doing sheet only submissions and that would be a bummer, but i don't want anyone to have to worry about their rights. <br/><br/>I wish i could just say Don't be a dick. I guess i could, but i don't want the blood on my hands if it goes pear shaped.                </div>

                            Kevin,<br/><br/>Damn, I'm sorry that I caused a train wreck over in your main thread. Like I said over there, I'm no expert in this area, but what I do know indicates that the sheet creator has the right to limit commercial use of their work unless they specifically give that right up through Creative Commons, making it public domain, or whatever. The clearest way to show this surrender of rights would be to include a disclaimer of some sort on the sheet itself when submitted. I really don't know, but maybe putting a disclaimer on your Web site could serve as a substitute, allowing any submitters to remove their sheet if they don't agree with it. <br/><br/>So is there an IP lawyer in the house?<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>

                            I think the easiest solution is to just let the rights be what they are: The creator of the sheet and the writer of the game share copyrights. People don't need to sign away their copyright to give someone permission to use it.<br/>
<br/>
If you design a sheet and send it in for this contest, it's obvious your sheet will be put up on Kevin's website, it will be used in a game somebody else writes, and that game will be made public in some form for free as a pdf or on a website or whatever. So I think permission for those things is implied if you enter the contest.<br/>
<br/>
But if the writer of a game wants to keep developing a game or make a commercial version of it, he can't do this without some sort of agreement between him and the creator of the sheet.                        </div>

                            I am not a lawyer, adjudicator, petitioner, or speaker for the dead.<br/>
<br/>
On a personal level, there are two parts to this for me.<br/>
<br/>
I've been shafted in the past having my work used by someone who became quite influencial in the gaming industry and provided a nod to my contributions and those of others at the beginning of the books.  I wasn't the one shafted the worst, but it still pissed me off.  But, now I've moved beyond this.  I entered a contest knowing full well that I was offering up a sheet to be used with an acknowledgement from the developed game as a reward.  It was a just for fun challenge that could let creativity flow.  My hesitation about full fledged public domain is that people outside the parameters of the contest or our local creator pool could directly benefit from the contest with never contributing anything.  This is why I think a Creative Common-Attribution agreement or something similar is a better option than public domain.<br/>
<br/>
If public domain rules the day though, I will not remove my sheet from the contest.  The thought that the person who benefited from my work in the past might benefit from something else I did is disturbing and disappointing, but something I can live with in this regard.  Now I will return to happy thoughts of the contest.<br/>
<br/>
Though I am against specific individual deals, if there were to be a decision that these sheets are public domain and these others are creative commons, then including that in the file name of the sheet with an explanation on your site could free-up those such who insist that their work be public domain.                        </div>

                            It's good to know people at least care about this.  <br><br>This seems to be a dispute between folks who don't want any restrictions on the re-use of their materials at all and those that want a clear and binding agreement.  The most liberal of the Creative Commons licenses set clear, sensible guidelines for use and re-use and I support that in principle.  One nice thing is that you can always allow an individual to do more than the blanket license allows, so if Nathan wants to use my game as toilet paper and sell it, all he has to do is ask and I will give him three thumbs up.  <br><br>But ultimately the IP guidelines Kevin chooses aren't going to make much difference for entries in the Gelatinous Cube Challenge.  It's a tempest in a teapot.  I'll participate no matter what and I'm not worried about it at all.  <br><br>The lesson here, as far as I'm concerned, is that if you want to have a contest or encourage people to contribute some stuff to some thing, just spell out from the beginning what status their work will be accorded.  If that's "let your freak flag fly", awesome.  If it's "I'll own it and say I wrote it", that's awesome too.  Then people can choose to participate or not without acrimony.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Two thoughts:</p>
<p>1) Requiring IP agreements <em>after</em> sheets are made and submitted is difficult and somewhat strange.</p>
<p>2) It doesn't matter.  We're all good people and artists and will necessarily come to an agreement.  If my sheet author is a giant dick about the rights to his sheet (insisting that I have to release it CC non-commercial sharealike, for instance), that will mark the first time, ever, that our community has had an IP dispute.</p>
<p>yrs--<br>
--Ben</br></p>
<p>P.S.  In the future, I think it would be a good idea to define all IP rights before a co-authored contest.  This can be as simple as "Rights granted for designers to use this work for the design of a role-playing game under the auspices of the Reverse/Engineer challenge," though.  I <em>hope</em> that our community does not start insisting on CC licenses to participate in its events.  I like our events, and would hate to have to stop participating, or do participation only from the fringes.</p>

Sure, hindsight and all that.  This is the first contest that Kevin's done, and the Creative and Awesome came in tidal waves, crashing against the hull of our cruise ship. It wasn't until later that someone's like, 'Oh, BTW, are there any lifeboats?"<br><br/>So yeah, good lesson all around for future endeavors (for the author of the endeavor, as well as participants, who can ask right away, "What about IP?"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></div>

                            What Jasper said.  I don't think you wanna get involved in the world of IP shit, Kevin.  Just run your contest and let the people involved sort out IP issues later if they need to.  Personally, I think anyone who enters this contest will be awesome enough that problems are extremely unlikely (and, in any case, they're not your responsibility).                        </div>

                            Yes, this definitely has nothing to do with you personally Kevin, no matter how you structure it.  Defining the parameters is more a service to the contributing community.  I feel pretty strongly that being proactive is good, though, and as originator you have the authority to do that, which could (in future) make everything cozy and simple.                        </div>

                            Jason, I love you dude, but I fundamentally disagree here.  <br/><br/>"Being proactive" in this case means imposing a set of legal restrictions on people who want to participate in the contest, restrictions that weren't clear from the beginning.  That doesn't equal more freedom in the long run.  The freedom is just spread around differently.  People signed on to this beast assuming that they would keep all rights to things that they made unless they specifically decided otherwise.  That's how these things typically work.  Imposing a uniform standard at this late date might cause some people to bail on the whole project, and that blows.  Next time, gadget, definitely.  But I think we're tardy to the party on this one.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think the way people think about IP is the most devisive issue in the indie community, because we don't all think about it the same way but we all feel very passionately about it. Any decision you make on this is gonna make people unhappy.  Even, in this case, making no decision.  But since this wasn't declared up front, I think that's the only fair decision to make.                        </div>

                            it was a big mistake for me to not have defined these parameters before the contest began. telling the whole truth i just plum didn't think of it. <br/><br/>I (personally) think Jasper has the right idea, and that will probably float pretty well. <br/><br/>In future events i will include loose guidlines for IP rights, hopefully with many choices for the creators (including a "don't worry about contracts or licenses, and just put it out there, whatever will be will be" option for people like ben and i who are pretty unconcerned).<br/><br/>sorry to forcibly lump myself with you ben, i agree with your principles here pretty heartily, i hope you aren't offended.                        </div>

                            Awesome, Kevin.  Don't feel bad - you'll note I did the same thing with the Owlbear contest - no discussion of it at all.  Nathan's in charge of bookitizing that, so the whole mess (or non-mess, depending on your POV)  is in his hands.                        </div>

                            Basically my viewpoint - for my own submission only - is that my sheet may be used as per the initial contest setup, which has attribution built-in. If anyone else wants to use it I ask for attribution as well. So mine's CC-Attribution, if you want a formal license. I'm not going to limit what you do with it beyond that.<br/><br/>Normally I release my stuff Attribution-Noncommercial, because I put a lot more time into it than I have into this - with a dual license that says "If you want to sell it, talk to me, we'll deal." But in this case Attribution will be enough.                        </div>

                            Hi guys,<br/><br/>Kevin, not doing anything at this point is completely cool with me. My orginal post was merely a suggestion since this is the first indie design event I know of that involved two participants collaborating on one game as part of its guidelines. As such, it seems like a special case. <br/><br/>In other contests (like the Ronnies and Game Chef), I clearly marked my entries with the "c in a circle" reserving copyright in my creative work. I didn't really care what other entrants did with theirs since it did not affect me. Here, however, the rights of the sheet creators does affect my my own work. I'll rely on Ben's well-founded faith in our community to cross that bridge when I come to it.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>

                            Hrm.  I'm a little confused about this whole kaffuffle.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if any of you have taken a close peek at my sheet, but it's got a totally non-touchy-feely-screw-this-dirty-hippy-shit copywrite tag on it.  That's because it's mine.  I made it.  That doesn't mean I'm not willing to negotiate with someone else to include it in a game.  (In this case, negotiate would likely boil down to "keep my name on it, and only allow duplication for personal purposes...but that's actually irrelevant).<br/>
<br/>
What is really confusing me is this: this whole IP thing is a non-starter.  Whoever gets my sheet (or any other sheet) isn't making a sheet.  They're making a game.  The game is their IP, the sheet is mine.<br/>
<br/>
So, where's the issue?                        </div>

                            Now, I think that the DBAD* Princiiple will mean that this scenario will NOT happen.

I'm gonna sell my game with the sheet in the back of it!<br>[game sells a million copies]<br>Sheetwriter: Hey, shouldn't I be getting some of that?

                            Nathan: Sure, but there should be some agreement between the two creators before the gamewriter starts selling the sheet. If this is a financial agreement or "sure, use my sheet", that's up to them.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see a problem with saying: "You may only use my sheet for non-commercial purposes." If the sheetwriter says so, I'm sure he's got his reasons. No point in calling him a dick beforehand.                        </div>

                            My two cents on the specifics of this contest and my involvement:<br/>
<br/>
  * I got involved for the challenge and the fun - not to make any money on it.  <br/>
  * If someone takes my sheet and is successful with it, great - but I would like to remembered/recognized for it.  Optimally, I would love to have the opportunity to be involved with the revision/refinement of the game (post-contect of course) intended for market.  I recognize that creative visions vary, so would not hold my breath over that.<br/>
  * Likewise, if something comes of my entry that I would like to translate into a "for market" product, I would definitely plan on talking to the original sheet designer and see how they would like to be recognized, involved, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So, short form - use my sheet.  I plan to be cool to whoever does and hope that the person whose sheet I get is cool to me.<br/>

                            Do we need something beyond "by entering the contest you agree that your character sheet can be used as part of the resulting game"?<br/><br/>Putting the sheet in the public domain, or using some of the CC licenses would be compatible with that goal.  As would a sight-unseen single party republication license.<br/><br/>I think it's mere good-sportsmanship that would demand that a printed game remit at least a free copy to the designer of the character sheet.  <br/><br/>That said, I freely place my sheet under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" rel="nofollow">CC-Attribution</a> license - in other words, I just want some recognition.  And I'd like a free copy, but that's all about how a prospective publisher was raised.                        </div>
