When do you Test vs Ob, when do you Versus Test, and when do you use an extended conflict method like Duel of Wits or Fight!? <br/><br/>I know there's some leeway and it's often up to the table, but I'm curious what rules of thumb you all use, if any. I run into problems when a scenario could play out with any of the three: Persuading the guard could be a simple Test vs Will as Ob, Versus Test with Persuasion, or a full Duel.<br/><br/>2. Do you really toss out Obstacles during Versus Tests?<br/><br/>Thief with Will 4, Persuasion 5<br/>Guard with Will 6, Persuasion 3<br/><br/>A simple test to persuade the guard to let the thief in requires a Persuasion roll (5 dice, Ob6). Good luck! Now what if the guard wants to shoo the thief away at the same time? Now they need a Versus Test, Persuade vs Persuade (5 dice vs 3 dice). It has just become a hell of a lot easier for the thief to talk his way past the guard.  How did this happen? Why? Do you throw in some advantage dice on the guard's side to compensate for his higher Will? It would make sense.<br/><br/>3. How can you change a character's mind in a major way?<br/><br/>The same thief says to the guard "The real money's in thieving, bloke. Now give us those keys and we'll both be rich men!" In this case the thief is trying to persuade the guard to give up his post and become a criminal. Assuming the guard resists, do you handle it with a Simple Test vs Ob or Duel of Wits? Can this even be done? Seems pretty potent if a social bad ass can run around rewriting NPCs (PC: "Leave your wife dude." NPC: "Yeah, okay."). Come to think of it, combat bad asses can just as easily erase the NPC all together so I guess it's not that ridiculous.<br/><br/>4. How do Beliefs enter social conflicts?<br/><br/>I've seen other games where it was very difficult to change a character's core (Exalted's 'Motivations'). Can social tests rewrite a character's Beliefs? Do Beliefs lend a benefit to applicable social conflicts? If I believe "Elves are inherently superior to Men" do I get some kind of Advantage or immunity when a man attempts to persuade me to break elven customs?<br/><br/>Lastly, I'm thinking of limiting FoRKing to 1 request per roll to eliminate 'FoRK Fishing': when a player asks to FoRK Armorer into his Strike ("I know where the armor is weakest!"), the table/GM calls a quick Yay or Nay, and then the Player rolls without scrounging for additional FoRKs. Does that sound unbalanced in any way?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance kids!!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183137/#Comment_183137" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T21:29:06+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  9:29PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2008 9:29PM by noclue.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarvis</cite><br/>1. When do you Test vs Ob, when do you Versus Test, and when do you use an extended conflict method like Duel of Wits or Fight!?</blockquote> If the action is not opposed by a PC or NPC use Ob test. If the action is opposed, but the conflict is not central to any character's story arc (i.e. isn't hitting a Belief or isn't part of a major PC goal), probably use Versus. If the conflict is meaty and everyone feels it needs to be a focus of the session, go to scripting.\n<blockquote>2. Do you really toss out Obstacles during Versus Tests?</blockquote>Not sure I understand your question.\n<blockquote>A simple test to persuade the guard to let the thief in requires a Persuasion roll (5 dice, Ob6). Good luck! Now what if the guard wants to shoo the thief away at the same time? Now they need a Versus Test, Persuade vs Persuade (5 dice vs 3 dice).

He'd do better avoiding chatting with silver tongued bastards and just eyeballing em until they move along. That said, if they're really going to start trying to persuade each other maybe its time for a DoW.\n<blockquote>3. How can you change a character's mind in a major way?</blockquote>Agree to that as stakes and start scripting.\n<blockquote>The same thief says to the guard "The real money's in thieving, bloke.

Just agree to different stakes. But corrupting guards can be loads of fun. I highly recommend it.\n<blockquote>If I believe "Elves are inherently superior to Men" do I get some kind of Advantage or immunity when a man attempts to persuade me to break elven customs?</blockquote>I don't think so. Beliefs don't protect you from temptation and weakness. But you do get artha regardless of whether you decide to follow your belief or break it.\n<blockquote>Lastly, I'm thinking of limiting FoRKing to 1 request per roll to eliminate 'FoRK Fishing': when a player asks to FoRK Armorer into his Strike ("I know where the armor is weakest!"), the table/GM calls a quick Yay or Nay, and then the Player rolls without scrounging for additional FoRKs.

But if a FoRK makes sense, we roll it in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183142/#Comment_183142" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T23:05:30+00:00" title="December 12, 2008 11:05PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2.  Maybe grant some Advantage Dice to the guard due to the asymmetry of the requests?  I agree with noclue that the guard is better off sticking to his high Will, which makes sense in game, as the guard probably only cares that the thief bug off after he's asked to be let in and is still hanging around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right though that versus test are a lot easier than normal tests.  I think that's the cost of trying to get something that you want, you open yourself up.  The other side of that is, the player doesn't get to log a more difficult test for advancement.<br/>\n<br/>\n3/4.  Remember Duel of Wits is not mind control, and I think this extends to the simpler social mechanics as well.  The character only agrees to do what you ask, maybe he's rationalized this somehow, but you haven't changed what he believes.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  There are traits that give you extra Dice or Body of Argument or something against something that contradicts your beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to FoRK fishing I think what's best is just have the player describe what their character is doing, or speak their argument or whatever, without staring at their skill list.  Then have them monger for dice.  This way they can get a couple legitimate FoRKs in when they need it, but you don't every player going through every skill on every test asking if they can FoRK.  Did you describe how it contributed?  No?  Then no FoRK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183145/#Comment_183145" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T01:02:08+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  1:02AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks so much guys.
