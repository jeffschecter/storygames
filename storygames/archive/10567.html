The GM will probably end up simply playing a much! more powerful, socially-connected character (a tyrant, in contrast to the other players portraying noteworthy members of local clans), and possess greater, but not fundamentally greater, authority and credibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234456/#Comment_234456" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-27T11:42:55+00:00" title="September 27, 2009 11:42AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon is correct, Misspent Youth does this, stealing most proximally from Primetime Adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234466/#Comment_234466" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-27T13:08:36+00:00" title="September 27, 2009  1:08PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is one of the best features of PTA, and if your game does this, it puts it more prominently on my map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234469/#Comment_234469" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-27T13:48:41+00:00" title="September 27, 2009  1:48PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Anyone heard of a game in which players can declare new scenes?

Players declare who is in the scene, what the set up is, and what sort of conflict the scene is about (character issues or story plot).<br/><br/>And, I'm going to counter what you said to Jonathan. D&amp;D <i>does</i> explicitly address this. The DMG2 has a whole chapter on giving players narrative and GM authority, including having players set of and drive scenes. At least 4E does. It's very integrative of indie gaming methods. You can even do it mechanically with skill challenges (although there's no direct advice on this, it's fairly easy to discern). However, I've seen a few discussions that do mechanize this (the Chatty DM blog discussed a system to mechanize player input by letting them start with their own minor quests, which builds their initial scenes and grows plot from there).<br/><br/>A Penny for My Thoughts is probably the strongest GM-less game that has a mechanic for players setting new scenes, but it's method is very particular (which involves "purchasing" the right with your pennies, pulling a scene element out of a hat and having the other players ask questions about it). Capes and Polaris simply go around the table, but like PTA, may have pieces that shine some light for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234472/#Comment_234472" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-27T14:21:30+00:00" title="September 27, 2009  2:21PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Alvin">@Alvin</a>: I am completely ignorant of 4E, so what you say is both good to hear and news to me.<br/><br/>Looks like i pretty much can't avoid looking at PTA; I'll have to take a look ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_234492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234492/#Comment_234492" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-27T22:28:51+00:00" title="September 27, 2009 10:28PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Tomas">@Tomas</a> again: why do you think I should "keep players as players" (my phrase, not yours; no idea why I put quotation marks)?

I'd say that if you're headed in a GMful direction, you might as well start walking now. Jason Morningstar's forthcoming Fiasco gives each player in turn the option to either initiate a scene or ask for a scene to be initiated by consensus, and my group has played it several times now for great justice. It led to the best single session of gaming I have ever had, and I can't think of a better reason to consider using it as a model. So, yeah, I recommend taking a look at that for your research. His Drowning and Falling, with its rotation of GM responsibilities, might also be relevant to the direction you want to go - the idea is that everyone starts with approximately equal GM-ness, in the form of their opening hands, and then chooses how to spend it.<br/><br/>InSpectres has Confessionals, which allow players to impose new meanings on existing scenes. That could be a cool thing to explore! The neat thing there is that you actually interrupt the ongoing scene briefly, re-author some part of it by re-interpretation, and then go back, where you get to see it through new eyes.<br/><br/>I am working on a game right now where the rules dictate that players frame scenes within other players' scenes under certain circumstances. If you're interested, I could mail you a copy (whisper me your email address). But it's super-structured, inspired by the Jeep games, and may not be what you're looking for.<br/><br/>MLWM is driven entirely by players asking a fixed GM for scenes, of course.  PTA is similar but more structured.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234573/#Comment_234573" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-28T14:47:15+00:00" title="September 28, 2009  2:47PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2009 2:54PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/c">@c</a>: I have some ideas that are starting to shape up, actually. For starters, I'm going to expand on the concept of the relationship map, such that it includes a location map (to keep it all straight), a Grudge list (to keep abreast of bad blood between groups, a big part of the game), and a scene history list, which uses a fairly intuitive notation to jot down each scene as it concludes, for posterity. <br/><br/>The way scenes are formed is kind of a piggyback method: anyone can call for a new scene, but must include at least one pre-existing character OR be set in a pre-established location. Using both a familiar place and a familiar face (ha ^_^) is just fine, too, but it's basically a way to give a smidge of structure, enough to keep things a bit more contiguous. Going off the notion that we can't effectively portray our own adversity, anyone can play any character in any scene <i>provided that</i> said character is not directly, currently at odds with that player's main character/protagonist. I want to encourage players to portray "NPCs" (non-protagonists, really, or, to use a Morningstar-esque term, non-*tagonists) in addition to their own characters; it's a good skill to pick up. I'm also thinking about letting anybody have a crack at playing any character (with the aforementioned caveat about adversity, of course), as a way of both softening the blow of missing/irregular player rosters and reinforcing the idea that each player (GM included) has only a single character that is "just theirs" - kind of trying to strike a balance, I suppose. <br/><br/>I think it'll make it a lot easier for everybody around the table to do this kind of thing if they have the Big Map in front of them - if they're aware of all the non-tagonists, scene settings, rivalries, and previous scenes (and thus the various plot threads running all at once), they'll be better equipped to shape something more coherent, and to help shape something more coherent.<br/><br/>One last thought, on whom-can-play-what: in my experience, it's a little silly to have a scene in which NPCs are rolling against each other and the players are totally left out. The idea of almost totally opening up the who-plays-what list is based on some playtesting notes from an older design of mine, <i>Mask of the Emperor</i>: provided that a non-tagonist is not an enemy of protagonist A, it's okay for player A to both roleplay and roll dice for that character. The big thrust of my idea is this: under no circumstances should a single player (GM or otherwise) be rolling dice for multiple characters that oppose one another. At the same time, the GM shouldn't have to resort to pure fiat to handle conflict between non-tagonists; I don't want to create gaping holes in the system's "coverage" like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236450/#Comment_236450" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T17:04:26+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  5:04PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2009 5:05PM by thadrine.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/>Without a character to focus on; without the strong identification with a character, the game-play will produce a more shallow experience for the player.
