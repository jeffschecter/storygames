As in, something arrived at in isolation that maybe tries to get at what seems to be missing from the hobby.

Most people familiar with roleplaying games already <i>know</i> you can make up your own games. Most people who <i>aren't</i> familiar with roleplaying games but who might be interested in playing one are probably going to be put off by the idea of a "game" that tells them to invent their own game before they can play it.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>The narrative explains they did it:  Because the Serenity RPG sucks sweaty donkey balls, though they don't spell it out in name. Hah! Great.</blockquote>\nAs someone who bought the <i>Supernatural</i> RPG (which uses the same system as Serenity)the other night, loved the flavor text, swore and grumbled through just about everything rules-related, and is already working on his very own Supernatural Heartbreaker, I heartily agree with his motivation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
