I took the role of Nemesis, since I had read the rules.  Also playing were my wife Jill, and regular members of our gaming groups Maude and Jonathan.  During the brainstorming portion I asked everybody for their favorite action movies, and got the following:  <br/><br/> Die Hard<br/>Escape from New York<br/>Commando<br/>Last Action Hero<br/><br/>Jonathan started off the brainstorming by mentioning time travel, I added the idea of \u2018buddy cops\u2019, since it\u2019s a classic of the genre.  There was a lot of side-tracking as we talked about what we liked in various movies.  Maude threw out 20s gangsters as an idea.  Jill liked the way the villain in \u2018Last Action Hero\u2019 discovered that in the real world, cops didn\u2019t respond immediately, so he had limitless opportunity to do anything he wanted.  A time-traveling villain would be like that\u2026  There was a brief side-track as Jonathan joked about musicals and documentaries \u2013 the documentary idea would wind up getting worked in later.  Jill raised the objection that buddy cops always means two, and we had three players.  I pointed out that there\u2019s always a love interest, and we were off and running.  <br/><br/>We wound up with:<br/>Time-traveling villain<br/>Buddy cops go back to capture him<br/>local guide / love interest<br/><br/>The  time traveling villain would travel back to the 1920s, and get involved with gangsters somehow\u2026<br/>We talked about Geraldo Rivera and Al Capone\u2019s vault, and I created the Nemesis \u2013 a Temporal Journalist doing a documentary about AI Capone!  I decided that he would be from the year 2147.  We worked out that the Government controlled time travel, but that a grant program provides limited access for academics and researchers to enter the past.  I still needed a diabolical plan.  Jonathan did a little quick research on Chicago in the 20\u2019s, and discovered that archaeologist Howard Carter had been in Chicago in 1921.  I had a sudden flash of inspiration for an opening scene for the trailer.<br/><br/>And then it was time to start:<br/><br/> Timequake<br/><br/>Trailer:\t<br/>Darkness.  Voice over, whispering in awe, "Wonderful things\u2026"  Iris open to a view of gleaming gold in Tutankhamun's tomb.  Pull back to floating video cameras and hover-lights.  Pull back further to show Victor Landrum giving an interview to the press about his discovery of the miraculously unlooted tomb of King Tutankhamun.  <br/> Cut:  Time Police HQ \u2013 The Situation Room.  \u2018Minority Report\u2019 style holographic computer displays surround police operators.  Red screens flash!  An operator with a headset shouts "Timequake detected!  Standing wave will reach the present in 19 minutes!"  An officer responds "We've got no time.  Send whatever officers we have available!"  (This was the point at which the movie got a name.)<br/> Cut:  A man dressed as a twenties gangster with a broad-brimmed hat stands holding a huge futuristic gun.  A woman dressed as a flapper stands back-to-back with him, with an even bigger gun!  (We decide that this image would also used as the movie poster. \uf04a )<br/> Cut:  Metal doors labeled 'Firing Range' iris open, and the 'flapper' is inside, running and gunning through a virtual environment at impossible speeds.<br/> Cut:  The 'gangster', dressed in a white undershirt, looking into a mirror, checking his graying hair -- then popping open a cybernetic shoulder panel and working on something inside\u2026<br/> Cut:  A woman on a busy street in the 1920s.  She looks around, and adjusts her glasses.  We hear the quiet sound of a shutter, and see faint graphics scrolling up her right lens as she documents the past...<br/> <br/>Characters:<br/> <br/>Dani McNamara<br/>Background -- <br/>loose cannon cop<br/>Stake --<br/>Preserving her humanity despite her augmentation<br/>Resources --<br/>Next-generation nanotech augmentation<br/> <br/>Frank Jones<br/>Background -- <br/>old-model Time Cop<br/>Stake -- <br/>Proving that he's 'still got it'!<br/>Resources -- <br/>Cybernetically enhanced<br/>Street-level contacts (added in Scene 1)<br/> <br/>Dr. Elizabeth Drayton<br/>Background --<br/>Pedantic historian<br/>Stake --<br/>Preservation of the timeline at any cost<br/>Resources --<br/>Knowledge of history<br/> <br/>Nemesis:<br/> <br/>Victor Landrum<br/>Background --<br/>Academic Journalist with numerous time-documentaries and awards to his credit.  <br/>Diabolical Plan --<br/>Victor plans to kill Howard Carter in the past, then discover King Tut's tomb himself back in 2147.<br/>Resources --<br/>Personal -- Handsome &amp; charismatic (Impact 1, added in Scene 3)<br/>Minions -- Documentary Video Crew (Impact 1, added in Scene 3)<br/> <br/> <br/>Establishing Shot:\t<br/>\tThe opening scene from the trailer plays out.  The hovering cameras and lights spin around, and in their lenses we see various scenes from the past, present, and future.  One scene is of the discovery of Tut's tomb by pith-helmeted explorers.  The scene shimmers, and suddenly the Valley of Kings is deserted, the only motion blowing sand.  The various scenes floating across the big screen arrange themselves into the movie\u2019s title:  TIMEQUAKE.  Then they explode into a swarm of overlapping images\u2026<br/> \tA scene comes to the fore, the Control Room at Time Police Headquarters.  The Operator and the Chief reprise the scene from the trailer, in expanded form.  "Our only hope of continuity is to stop the Timequake.  The epicenter is in 1921.  Latitude and Longitude show Chicago."  A technician reports.  "Sir, we have power for two insertions."  The Chief nods.  "Generate the data wafers.  Get McNamara and Jones up here on the double -- and get someone from Compliance to outfit them!"  <br/> \tOfficer Danielle McNamara, in her skin-tight police uniform, arrives first.  She waves aside the proffered data wafer, cocks her head to one side, and directly downloads the data into her nanotech implants.<br/> \tOfficer Frank Jones, also in a futuristic police uniform, shows up, opens his shoulder-access panel, and installs his data wafer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204610/#Comment_204610" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T22:58:16+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 10:58PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 1\tDani &amp; Frank insert into 1921 amid a blast of blue lightning, arriving in a back alley behind a speakeasy.  A bum with a bottle lying in the alley sees them, looks at the bottle, looks at them, puts the bottle down\u2026  Tinny piano music comes from inside.  Frank looks at his partner.  "I think they're playing our song."  They enter the speakeasy when the back door is opened so that two bouncers can throw someone out into the gutter.  (Jonathan directed the scene, and added \u2018Street-level contacts\u2019 as a resource, so that the bum could figure in a later scene\u2026)<br/><br/>Scene 2\tInside the speakeasy, the piano music is louder.  Flappers and well-dressed men drink and dance.  Dr. Elizabeth Drayton is using her glasses to record events and taking subvocal notes.  Half the video crew is here as well.  Pedantically, Liz leans over to correct someone's slang usage.  She notices Dani &amp; Frank's entrance, in their 'Hollywood 20's' garb.  "Let's play 'spot the out-of-place time travelers." She says to the man next to her.  Jerry, the unit Director. Glances where she indicates.  "Oh, God -- Time Cops!" he groans.  Frank says "Let's play 'spot the out-of-place time travelers." to Dani -- only he's serious.  Looking around, they spot Al Capone, and other notable Chicago Mafiosi, but not any of the video crew.  They blend in too well.  A unit Gopher sidles up behind them and says "Dr. Drayton would like to see you."  Going to her table, they are confronted by the angry scientist.  "Has Timepiece lost it's mind?  You look like comic opera gangsters!"  About to caution them further about their appearance, she is cut off by Frank, and briefed on the Timequake.  She protests the Time Cops arrival and involvement, but Frank gets the last word:  "Your resources are now at our disposal."  (This one was Jill\u2019s scene.  She and Jonathan had a good time doing in-character dialogue, then re-wrote some of the dialogue to make Liz less cooperative, because that seemed more dramatic, and set up future conflict between Liz and Frank.)<br/><br/>Scene 3\tDani accesses her implant, and determines that the Timequake origin is 17:38, this coming afternoon, somewhere on the University of Chicago campus.  Around the heroes, the party continues unabated into the wee hours of the morning.  The documentary crew surreptitiously gathers video and audio data...  (This scene was Maude\u2019s.  I got the impression at the time that Maude didn\u2019t know exactly what to do with her scene, so she just went directly toward the plotline we had penciled in.  I asked for permission to bring in the Nemesis, and used it to give the following cut scene.  I needed to establish my villain to the \u2018audience\u2019, and give him information about the heroes.)    <br/><br/>Cut Scene\tThe Gopher from Scene 2 knocks on a hotel room door.  Victor Landrum lets him in.  Victor lives well, with nice whiskey and cigars, and a velvet smoking jacket.  Three beautiful women are lounging around as well.  "Sir, I just thought you'd like to know\u2026  Two Time Cops showed up at the bar."  The Gopher looks nervous.  "Those sports bets you've been having me make\u2026   I know doing stuff like that is against the rules\u2026"  Victor tells him to relax, and that he will take care of everything.  "Just keep our bookie under wraps for another day or two.  Everything will be fine."  He pats the Gopher on the back, but the camera shows Victor's face.  He is\u2026 concerned.  (I wanted to establish the Gopher as a Henchman, but I didn\u2019t have enough Threat Tokens.  I contented myself with spending two tokens, one on a personal Resource, \u2018handsome &amp; charismatic\u2019, and one to make the documentary crew Victor\u2019s Minions.  <br/><br/>Scene 4\tPolice raid on the speakeasy!  As the police burst in, billy clubs at the ready, the speakeasy staff is hiding the entire operation!  "Cheese it, it's the cops!"  Frank yells, getting into the spirit of the local slang.  Dani pulls up a map of the building on her implant, and locates a secret door behind the bar.  It leads to an escape tunnel.  Frank grabs Liz, who grabs Jerry the Director and a couple of the other video crewpersons, and they make their escape.  As Frank tries to shut the door, a billy club bounces off his (reinforced) skull.  He grabs the man wielding it, and recognizes the 'bum' from the alley earlier.  "From one cop to another -- you've got more important people than us to arrest tonight."  Frank shoves the man away and slams the door.  (Jonathan\u2019s scene again:  He wanted an Action scene because the Danger to everyone\u2019s Stakes was rising.  The police were his idea, and as Nemesis I got to run them.  Some issues arose with the action rules, which I will summarize below.  Jonathan used his Stake and his starting Resource to get extra cards, and Maude used Dani\u2019s Resource to throw in an extra card as well.  They won decisively, and got two Outcomes.  They each used one to erase their Resource use.  Jonathan\u2019s Stake dropped back one Danger level, so his final narration showed Frank proving that he can still get the job done!)<br/><br/>Scene 5\tAt the University of Chicago, early dawn.  Liz says "How can we tell when the Timequake starts?"  Dani replies, emotionlessly.  "I'll know."  Cut to an overlay of graphics scrolling by on Dani's pupil.  A montage shows them wandering around campus, aimlessly searching.  Liz spots a poster for a lecture by Howard Carter, scheduled for that afternoon.  "Howard who?" asks Frank.  Liz gives the exposition...  (Jill\u2019s scene.  There was some discussion about a scene of the heroes escaping through the tunnels under Chicago, but Jill decided that that would just wind up on the cutting room floor anyway, so she skipped ahead.)<br/> <br/>Unfortunately, we had to stop at this point, due to time constraints.  The threat Track was at 5 (just one short of entering Act II) and I had 3 Threat Tokens available.<br/><br/>_                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204611/#Comment_204611" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T22:59:09+00:00" title="April 30, 2009 10:59PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are the issues we ran into during play:<br/> <br/>The Nemesis needs to start with some Threat!  Perhaps 5, at the outset.  Otherwise, the Nemesis really can't affect things in the first few scenes.  I wanted to establish the Gopher as a Henchman -- but I didn\u2019t have enough Threat to buy a Henchman at any point.<br/> <br/>Without the ability to frame scenes myself, I had trouble getting the Diabolical Plan rolling.  <br/> <br/>In an Action Scene, when one side has more cards than the other, are all of the unopposed cards turned over singly with narration for each, or can they be turned over at once?<br/> <br/>I like the new 'helping' rules; they make sure that the scene Director's character is in the spotlight.  However, looking forward to when we eventually would have gotten to the climactic battle, I'm not sure that one character should be in the spotlight.  On the other hand, mechanically, giving everyone their Background cards for the climax makes the Nemesis tremendously outnumbered...  <br/> <br/>The Danger to each character's Stake goes up with every scene, which seems a little fast -- although that does encourage the players to get those Stakes in there during Action sequences!<br/> <br/>Everyone was enjoying the story so far, and there is some hope that we can schedule a session to finish the movie.  There were some problems with scene-framing, but nothing too rough.  I think we all need to get more \u2018cinematic\u2019 with our ideas of pacing, and less hung-up on \u2018what happens next\u2019 to the existing point-of-view characters.  <br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204785/#Comment_204785" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T12:21:35+00:00" title="May  1, 2009 12:21PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Dain,<br/><br/>Firstly thanks very much for running a playtest for me, I really liked the idea for your film!<br/><br/>There was another playtest recently posted over at the Collective Endeavour<br/><br/><a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/1634" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/1634</a><br/><br/>where things did not go quite as smoothly as they did with you. That prompted me to look at the game again and rework not only the language but some of the mechanics. Here is what I changed:<br/><br/>Threat: is now gained at the start of the act and must be spent by the end of the act it is gained in. This stops the nemesis hoarding threat and also means he has something to use right from the start. The amount of threat gained is less as well to reflect...<br/><br/>Nemesis resources: this are now like the hero resources in that they start at 3 impact, but cost 1 threat.<br/><br/>Resources: can now not be bolstered after they are bought, this will encourage the creation of a variety of resources over the course of the game. I have also clarified the way resources are blocked by consequences after an action scene.<br/><br/>Nemesis scenes: these are back in after me taking them out for the last version. The nemesis gets a scene after each protagonist, the players controlling a hero, has had a scene. This allows him to get some time to develop his diabolical plan and also create some resources. The nemesis' role in other scenes is also clarified.<br/><br/>Colour and action scenes: each protagonist gets 2 colour scenes per film and everything else is an action scene. I am working on better advice as to what constitutes and action scene.<br/><br/>The rules for other players helping with an action scene have changed a little and I have clarified a lot about the finale. Will get the new version out to you, and anyone else who is interested, soon.<br/><br/>Thanks again<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204797/#Comment_204797" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T14:05:06+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  2:05PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2009 6:48PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a current version of the playtest document available?
