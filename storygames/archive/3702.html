Serenity/Firefly, BSG...<br/>At Dexcon I had two almost full tables from running a game set in Terry Pratchett's Discworld.  Although in the genre/property celebration game, most players don't care about the system.<br/>Unfortunately, the property thing only works sometime.  I almost never get a full table for adventures set in the Brisco County Jr. world.  Andrew's LARP set around the series "The Lost Room" was canceled due to low turn out (and my wife and I were two of the signed up players), but thats an amazing property for a LARP.<br/><br/>At the previous Dexcon or was it Dreamation, someone did a trifold/stapled handout with all the indie games and a brief description.  I thought that was a good idea, but I'm not sure if it helped bring in players.<br/><br/>At Dexcon, WEGS was a tremendous amount of hack-n-slash fun, but for all the advertising Larry did he still ended up canceling about 1/2 his slots due to lack of players.<br/><br/>So, how do you get more players to come to the Awesome?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83144/#Comment_83144" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T07:56:18+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  7:56AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't surveyed players about why they play in one of my games.

Ever year I ran that GURPS game at GenCon SoCal (which, being right across from Disneyland, made it relevant), I had a packed table (which is six players).  That counts when I ran it twice.  One year I was asked by the con staff if a 7th player could join, because of some sort of event mix-up.  I think the third year I ran it, people came in because someone talked about my game the previous year to all their friends.<br/><br/>I can't recall my blurb for that game.<br/><br/>Let's see.  My Spirit of the Century game at the last Conquest Sac was full, with only two of my home players in the group knowing anything about SotC.  Along with being a favorable slot (6pm - 10pm on Saturday), I suspect it also had to do with pulp, the use of exclamation marks, stuff like that.<br/><br/>My blurb for that game:<br/>"During the Great War, you and your friends defeated the great villain, Gorilla Khan.

My approach has been:<br/><br/>- I always go for a game that is very different from the mass of other games posted, but not so outlandish that people can't figure out what it's about.  Many story games are great for this.<br/>- When inspired, I try to use a movie or book setting that many people are interested in but that is not already covered by a licensed game.  Examples have included <i>Firefly</i> (before the <i>Serenity RPG</i> was out), <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i> (before the crappy movie), etc.<br/>- Most important, I always have a short catchy game blurb that (hopefully) makes people excited and curious.<br/>- When I'm feeling enterprising, I may link the blurb to a pre-con Website giving more info.<br/><br/>I try to use simple systems that allow minimal explanation at the table.  I normally have pre-gen characters ready unless the game also includes on-the-spot character creation (e.g., <i>Wilderness of Mirrors</i>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83217/#Comment_83217" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T10:47:41+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 10:47AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First a question - Does your game have to limited to the role playing hall?<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask because it is nice sometimes to take a game into different crowds. One way to do that is to do up a version as a board game, another as a miniatures game and a third as a role play game. I've billed Engle Matrix Games as all of these at one time or another. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started out doing Con games I went to miniatures conventions - so I called them miniatures games. When I first went to Gen Con (1991) that's how I billed them. The thing with miniatures games are that people will walk by and if they like your lay ot they will join. So to get this walk by traffic I made nicer stuff. When you do this though you have to pay attention to people walking past, make eye contact and invite them to ask questions. Some will join - those who don't have still heard the pitch.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course having a good blurb is useful. At big cons people look at the titles and game system. Players who only came to play D+D are a lost cause - they won't be swayed by anything. The more adventurous types will scan titles. You need to catch their eyes. Zombies in Disneyland does that (though don't say that too loudly - the mouse police are very techy) Kill puppies for Satan does to. Movie tie ins and genre pieces like "Cthulhu" anything pull others. Historical pieces pull some. There really is no way to know what will hook but enthusiasm does matter. A brief dramatic description is better than something boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I had to learn by repeated failure was that the esoteric subjects I like are NOT popular. Nothing about 1848 revolutionaires attracts any attentions. Darn the unfairness of it all!<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle <br/>\nHamster Press                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83443/#Comment_83443" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T09:16:27+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  9:16AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well... what gets people to my table is me asking them.

I'm a sucker for catchy descriptions!  <br/><br/>But so much is in the eye of the beholder.  In the other thread, jim pinto gave examples of blurbs he's used, and he seemed to be surprised and disappointed that they didn't generate more interest at the convention.  On the other hand, like others said in that thread, they read like vanilla fantasy to me.  The difference is that the GM has an entire setting and story in his or her mind's eye, but the rest of us only have the meagre 200 or so characters allowed by the convention program.<br/><br/>At Go Play NW, we had another example; one GM (you know who you are!) had trouble getting players for a homebrew that was probably very interesting, but was not promoted well.  The description included some key no-no's: fantasy, homebrew, "20 years in the making."  Instead of being advantages, in a description these become giant liabilities.  Everyone hearing them flashes back to some weird GM they've know years ago, still living in his parents' basement and compulsively detailing his Tolkien-clone setting. Do I think this is what was being offered?  Probably not, but neither was there anything to tell us what it was about the game that should wow us.<br/><br/>I'm giving these examples not to point fingers at people, but to illustrate a very common problem at conventions.  While a one-sentence zinger description is no guarantee that I'll have fun for four hours at the gaming table, a dull, confusing, intimidating, or clich\xc3\xa9 one is almost certainly going to be a turn-off unless I know the GM personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83702/#Comment_83702" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T15:10:42+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  3:10PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lxndr</cite>Nothing.

The thing that continues to put me off of Fastlane is that it isn't about anything.  That's a harsh, unfair criticism, but even GURPS Basic has a default setting.  Fastlane continues to come across as a game about <i>anyone</i> who lives on the edge.  With a roulette wheel!  And while I personally don't need a whole lot of setting, I need something concrete to figure out what the game is about.<br/><br/>Which relates to the topic at hand in that the subject of a game and it's GM are the two biggest attractors for me at a con.  "Fastlane" doesn't tell me a whole lot about what we'll be playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83779/#Comment_83779" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T08:04:46+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  8:04AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jbuchert</cite>1) Your reputation as a GM<br/>2) A cool game system that's all the buzz that people want to try<br/>3) Your blurb (and other possible ads you may have)<br/>4) Location!

I'd add in:<br/><br/>6) Target marketing: Think about how your game satisfies someone's urge along the lines of "I always wanted to play ___________", where the blank might be a system or a setting or a TV show or movie or whatever.  Mash up as many of these elements as possible into a single thing to maximize "draw".<br/>7) Allies: Get a few "folks about town" out in the mix to do some recruiting on your behalf.  As the source of the game, you're the pusher, your value as someone saying "hey, you should play my game" is tainted by your direct interest in running the slot.  A friend of yours telling someone "Hey, you should play in his game!" comes off as more genuine, and thus maximizes the enthusiasm angle.  (This is honestly why I'm very content to let other people run SOTC or DRYH at cons.  I feel the results emerge more genuinely from love of the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83825/#Comment_83825" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T18:02:24+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  6:02PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judson, you're right. About games like Fastlane being hard sells in terms of con games. Universalis is even worse. In fact, I don't know that I've to date seen a scheduled con game of Universalis. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I've personally played it a ton at cons, and have seen it played by others at cons a lot (and no, not just with Ralph there, either). That's because it is, very specifically, the sort of game you play off the cuff. I think Fastlane is that way to a certain extent, too. There are few people who carry around that roulette wheel. But if they do, they can be ready to have a lot of fun at the drop of a hat. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I don't bother scheduling games, and I think it's not the best way to get play to occur.

Instead, I saw the three days of the con being like this.<br/><br/>The concept of the scheduled block of time comes from the "tournament" -- using D&amp;D (and children's) competitive rules for a group of strangers to meet on equal ground to overcome a series of neutral challenges contained in the module.<br/><br/>This functions well for a scheduled block of Squad Leader, Risk, Monopoly.<br/><br/>And it <i>can</i> work well to introduce people to games like <i>Dogs in the Vineyard </i>and son on.<br/><br/>But unlike "tournament" style games, I'd argue that "'story-games" -- whatever those are -- are not about overcoming the challenges of the dungeon as a team, competing against other teams using the same numbered character stats and room descriptions.  (Which, by the way, <i>makes perfects sense for a Gamist, competitive event.</i>)<br/><br/>A game of <i>Dogs</i> or <i>Primetime Adventures</i> might best served by not being crammed at the table with strangers, but with people you'd like to play with.  (I think of Ron's "band analogy" here.)

Participants have usually paid good money to be there, and they need means to get in at least some of the games they're interested in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83877/#Comment_83877" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-29T11:59:36+00:00" title="July 29, 2007 11:59AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sophie,<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>Part of what I responding to is Paul Tevis' request for more brainstorming on this....

So you'll probably have another game with the same group. And...so...groups don't mix so much. This is why I like timeslots, really.<br/><br/>Also, I'd imagine you'd be more likely to play with the people you know.<br/><br/>Also, I don't want to be at a convention with anyone who spends their time chillin'.

We went home and singlehandedly recreated every aspect of the game after the demos just so we wouldn't have to wait until Gencon to be able to play it. Icon was like 4 months ago, and at the moment WEGS is our DAILY game of choice. Some of my friends are so addicted to the game that they just can't stop. Sure gaming tables at Cons will flourish or die dependant on lots of minute details and tricks that people can employ to guarantee a good turnout - but this does not in any way reflect just how hands down awesome the game is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to reassure everyone out there who hasn't had a chance to play this game, and won't until the basic books are released - hold onto your hat, because a maelstrom of intensity is about to take the gaming world by storm. I'm not affiliated with WICK at all, but I can say that every person I know who's touched WEGS, and been a part of that frantic vegas style poker chip spointing dice rolling action, has not been able to put the game down. If you're at a Con - free food and booze, or flashy index cards might get you the gamers of the moment, but it takes a really super sweet game to keep the gamers hooked long after the convention lights have flickered off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWEGS is that game! I'm not just whistling dixie here people. Consider me a prophet giving you omens of the future. Pandoras box has been opened, my friends, and will be completely open at Gencon this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd inside that box, are spoints.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the major problems at ICON is that gamers have to stare at a table of sheets with minor blurbs about the game, and then sign up their name for it. Many game slots go unfilled, and often times if a slot gets filled late, the game master has already left because of low turnouts earlier. (This happened to me twice this year.) Players signing up will pick games based on their name alone, and whether or not anyone else has signed up for it. This lets new games go unnoticed, or games with great masters and potential get lost in the shuffle of mediocrity. I think the best way to remedy this would be a tripod with a poster. Advertisement at the table itself is essential, and a little advertising goes a long way. Another good trick for keeping gamers attention, is to have a bag of candy. Something simple, like jolly ranchers, or some sort of mint. Many gamers smoke, and will get antsy if they don't have something orally fixating them. Often times this leads to quick breaks to go get munchies mid game. Something for the gamers to stick in their mouth, generally helps them focus on the task at hand rather than getting lost. Also non smokers love candy, and sugar highs help at cons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
