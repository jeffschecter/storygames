Where do you go to get them? And in what format do you buy them? I gather .epub is a common format, but is it the one you actually use?<br/><br/>If you were buying an RPG book on it, how would that work? For example, I can create a file in .epub format, which you could view on an iPod Touch. But you wouldn't just download that from my website, I presume. How would you buy that book? What sort of online store thing would you go to?<br/><br/>As you can tell, I'm fairly ignorant about such things: my interest has been piqued by my brother's iPod Touch, on which I've managed to open an .epub file I've created.

Mostly for this exact reason. What I have found is that I will likely choose an e-reader that supported PDFs due to RPGNow.com and how a lot of gaming companies seem to be selling watermarked PDF copies of their books ususally even before the print copy is available and also as a bundle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that a lot of e-readers support PDFs but some are better at it than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for purchasing an e-book. The primary way most e-readers seem to be going is access to an online store made available through the software. So Kindle goes to amazon's kindle store. The Nook access's Barnes and Noble's ebook store. There may or may not be separate online stores as an app for the iPhone.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor an independent publisher trying to break into e-readers. I'd imagine you'd be selling your file, and letting people download 'em, and then let the customer load it to their e-reader however they do. If you were going to be a courteous seller, you'd probably look up the uploading instructions for the various types of e-readers out there in order to create a guide for your customers to follow. I'm sorry I don't have more specific details on that but if I do buy a e-reader I'll try and remember to post here what I find out about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain the above is based upon research, not actual fact or trail testing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240942/#Comment_240942" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-08T02:43:17+00:00" title="November  8, 2009  2:43AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are going for ebook readers, use an ebook format (not PDF, in other words). Epub should now be supported by most readers, but if you manage to produce the text in some abstracted format it should also be not that much work to have some automated process to build the same text in several formats (mobi, for example, but also plucker, plain html, rendered pdf...).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know most or all of the ebook readers can actually load content from places other than the official bookstore of their seller (if any), so you'd need some FAQ instruction page for the most popular 3 or 4 (with help of the users of those readers should be fairly easy).<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting IN the online bookstores, I don't know.

It's known that the Kindle requires special software to convert and read PDF files, and this doesn't always work correctly. I believe the Sony Reader also has some PDF issues. The iRex iLiad seems to read PDF perfectly. The iPhone and iPod Touch have good PDF reading utilities available, but the small size of the screen means that these are very difficult to read without being reformatted specifically for the device.<br><br>The only format I know for sure will work on all of these devices is RTF, which means no pretty pictures. The iLiad and the Kindle both support MobiPocket, which is my personal favourite (it's basically a modified version of HTML) but the Sony Reader does not. The Sony Reader and numerous other older systems supports ePub, but I'm not sure about the iLiad and it's not mentioned in the Kindle's product specs. HTML seems to be the next best bet, but I am not 100% certain that all readers will display images properly, plus you've no direct provision for embedding those images.<br><br>And as for getting your products onto the iPod or iPhone permanently rather than using a web browser... I don't know. There are ebooks on the iPod accessory store, but I don't know how they are created. Given Apple's policy of sticking two fingers up at Microsoft, you'd probably beed a Mackintosh to make them. For the iPod, the best format is probably a specially formatted mini page PDF, as there are plenty of good third-party applications out there that read them.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mordheim" title="mordheim"><img alt="mordheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.darkreign40k.com/drjoomla/images/comprofiler/tn62_47cea863027df.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mordheim">mordheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241019/#Comment_241019" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T00:49:47+00:00" title="November  9, 2009 12:49AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the iPhone there is Stanza (http://www.lexcycle.com/)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere you can read how you can transfer ebooks from your pc to the iPhone:<br/>\nhttp://www.lexcycle.com/faq/how_to_get_books_onto_stanza_iphone<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241023/#Comment_241023" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T04:35:43+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  4:35AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have one Kindle and two iPhones.

You turn pages with your thumb, sliding across the screen so it feels like turning a page (and there's a subtle page flipping sound).  Generally a very satisfying implementation.  The books are arranged front-facing on a bookshelf so I can see them, and each one has a 'ribbon' bookmark for holding your place.<br/><br/>I paid $0.99 CAD for it, and feel quite good about the purchase.

It also recently has added an extract to plain text feature allowing for faster reading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241350/#Comment_241350" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T17:30:49+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  5:30PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now I do all my ebook reading on my iPhone.<br/><br/>Most of the ebooks I buy are PDF format game books, so I use GoodReader, which is the only PDF reader on the iPhone that actually makes reading large PDFs feasible.  GoodReader has an embedded web server for the purpose of allowing you to upload files to it over the local network.<br/><br/>For ePub/Mobi/etc formats, there is Stanza. I used Stanza to read a series of potboiler SF novels (Lost Fleet), which I purchased from the various online bookstores that are supported from within Stanza (there are a bunch of them).  I'd buy from whichever one was cheapest. It'll then download the ePub or whatever directly to your phone. Thing is all the books you pay for are DRM encumbered, which basically means that after your done reading them you are left with nothing.  I'd only ever do this for books I was sure I'd just throw away anyway.<br/><br/>I've also made a few Stanza books from text files or simple PDFs using the Stanza desktop software.  It lets you transfer stuff to the Stanza reader app on the phone.<br/><br/>I actually read the first of those novels using the iPhone Kindle reader just to see what it was like. It was fine, but Stanza has so many more features that I'd never use the Kindle app again. You of course buy stuff for that on the Amazon site, and then it downloads to the reader app when you start it.<br/><br/>I also have Eucalyptus, which is gorgeous, has the best UI of any reader app, is massively overpriced, and only connects to the Project Gutenberg archive. I'm actually using it for most of my reading lately, since I'm on a kick of reading old pulps, but I can't recommend it.<br/><br/>I've not seriously investigated any of the dedicated eBook readers since as far as I can tell, none of them really do the "I want to load and read PDFs I already own" story very well, if at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241371/#Comment_241371" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T21:49:10+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  9:49PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rafial</cite><br/>I've not seriously investigated any of the dedicated eBook readers since as far as I can tell, none of them really do the "I want to load and read PDFs I already own" story very well, if at all.</blockquote>\nThe sad truth is that none of the dedicated ebook readers do pdf worth even half a damn.  The nominal support that most of them provide and even advertise is inadequate to say the very least.  Ryan Dancy was talking about White Wolf going to ebooks, on a pdf model.  I think he'll change at least some of that the first time he tries to load a pdf onto that shiny new kindle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
