This is a cross-posting from the rpg site. Sounds strange, I know <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Here's the deal:<br/><br/>I like octaNe. A lot. The only thing that irks me is the fact that a player can potentially end a scene whenever he rolls one single 5 or 6 on (usually) 3D6. Basically, it's a scene resolution approach. <br/>I like to have good fights in my games, with a lot of flavor and detail. And I like to have tension in those fights, uncertainty that keeps us on the edge of our seats when we roll the bones.<br/><br/>Which is something that scene resolution just can't do. It's almost counterproductive in this way; at least this is my experience with it. <br/><br/>So how can I turn octaNe's scene resolution into something more blow-by-blow-like? I appreciate your ideas, fellas.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331062/#Comment_331062" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T16:59:51+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  4:59PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's where Hazards come into it, right?<br/>If you're trying to draw it out more, without necessarily making your bad guys extra tough, how about giving baddies a "Plot Point Buffer"? It'd work like a temporary Hazard, so after a certain number of Player-scene-control results (4+ rolls) are sucked up into the great Buffer Black Hole, it'd be used up, and the baddie would be at the whims of the character as normal.<br/>So, for example, say you were fighting a gang of mutant bikers with a Buffer of 3. If you rolled 4 dice with a 2, 3, 5, and 6, since the <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are the only rolls that give the Player control over the scene, they'd be removed, leaving the <b>3</b> as the final result (being the next highest), and the gang's Buffer would be reduced to 1 (since it removed two dice).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/norbertgmatausch" title="norbertgmatausch"><img alt="norbertgmatausch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/412/n6C0O3XAEQ2GP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/norbertgmatausch">norbertgmatausch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331071/#Comment_331071" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T18:33:00+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  6:33PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!<br/><br/>So that means you'd change the Hazard rules so Hazard points would only eat up the players' "full control" results? Is this what you're saying? That might work, I'll have to try it next time.<br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Wait a minute... a thought just crossed my mind... what if I said that for every point of Hazard a, er, hm, well, hazard, has, there has to be one "snapshot" of the conflict?<br/>Like, we have a Hazard 3 here (an extremely nasty T-Rex with steel-reinforced teeth that's controlled by a mad midget scientist riding in a bulletproof cockpit fused onto the top of the dinosaur's head), and regardless of the dice result, the players and GM have to narrate 3 different "angles" or snapshots of this fight. So, it would be cool if the GM removed one high die at a time and narrated with the player what is happening, and repeats this process till the Hazard is reduced to 0.<br/><br/>This could work, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331117/#Comment_331117" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T23:48:24+00:00" title="June 21, 2011 11:48PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Normally, I would personally avoid changing the Hazard rules, since I think it works pretty well for cinematic action games. The whole Buffer idea was more a "first thing that comes to mind" thing.<br/>Your idea might actually work better, since it wouldn't be changing anything, per se, but instead zooming in on the action. Best thing to do would be to try it out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
