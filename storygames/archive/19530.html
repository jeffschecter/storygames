If you don't have something you can take something out of someone else's pocket.  Put the Thing in a Place.</li>\n<li> By enacting characters in turn, the players will collaboratively tell the story of how the Thing came to be in the Place.  Turns will proceed in alphabetical order by last names.  Each turn is a <i>Scene</i>.  The first person is <i>"Thing Handler 1",</i> the second will be <i>"Thing Handler 2",</i> etc.  But give them real names, I mean, come on.  And some background stuff.  Maybe a problem.</li>\n<li> Each Thing Handler must try to make sure that their Scene includes at least one of these <i>Doozies:</i> (1) emotional conflict, (2) physical conflict, (3) chilling horror, (4) sexual tension, (5) sexual release, (6) somebody most of you know, or (7) Chuck Norris.  You will get a point for every Doozie you include.  A Doozie is considered included when you say it is, but only if no one else disagrees.</li>\n<li> Other players may be drafted and cast by the Thing Handler to play whatever other roles are necessary to complete the Scene.  These <i>Non-Handler Characters</i> (NHCs) may be played as cleverly elusive, understandably resistant, frankly terrified, or otherwise in less than 100% total agreement, but aside from displaying their difficult decision in a heart-wrenching and oscar-winning way, they are not permitted to do anything except go along with whatever the Thing Handler wants to happen.  They have no choice, for some reason.  Drama, people.</li>\n<li> Each Thing Handler must end their turn by describing how they left the Thing behind, lost it, sold it, transferred it to the next Thing Handler, or otherwise parted ways with the Thing - except for the last Thing Handler, who is called the <i>Omega Handler.</i>  The Omega Handler must end their turn by describing how it was through their own actions or decisions that the Thing ultimately came to be in the Place.</li>\n<li> Now compare point scores.  The person with the greatest number of points gets to pretend they just found the Thing and are going to keep it, while the person from whose pocket the Thing came must act like they don't even care, but secretly they do.  If they are the same person, they're probably schizophrenic or something.  That's cool.  Then there's more drama for a while.  But then give it back.  Because, come on, it's their Thing.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434718/#Comment_434718" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T13:18:16+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  1:18PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2014 1:13PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Update: After some discussions with players, it seems that "Pocket Things" was <i>not</i>, in fact, too far.  <br/>A slightly revised version is <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/131525/Pocket-Things" rel="nofollow">now available</a> on RPGNOW as a pay-what-you-want, one-page PDF.<br/><br/>I promise to go farther next time.

I have not playtested the RAW, although it is based on an informal game my brother and I used to play.  As far as playing time, I'm thinking maybe 5 minutes per player, tops.  Larger group the better, almost certainly.  I added the words "three or more players" to the rules because it does seem almost mandatory, but in fact when my brother and I played our version we would simply hand the agency back and forth, pretending to be different characters each time.  This basically continued until someone saw a "perfect opportunity" to put the Thing in the Place.  There were no points or Doozies in the original game.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">This thread is about Too-Farness in general.  There are several things about PT which I believed might cause people to consider the game to fit that description.  I agree with Paul that it's a little intimidating :-)  But yes, please feel free to submit your own ideas or rules which Go Too Far.</span><br/><br/>This thread has been focused more tightly, in order to allow the "Too Far" tag to be used for other games.<br/>- TF, 14 Aug 14<br/><br/>N.B.: The original game was inspired by a "made for TV movie" from the 1970's called "The Gun", which traced the path of a single handgun from owner to owner until it was involved in a murder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Raisin" title="Raisin"><img alt="Raisin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Raisin">Raisin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435038/#Comment_435038" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T12:35:40+00:00" title="July  9, 2014 12:35PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That movie, is it any good apart from the concept?

It was the conceptual structure - <i>tracing the path of an item as it moves from hand to hand</i> - that caught me.<br/><br/>It's not hard to imagine breaking the 4th wall in PT, since you already have an impetus to include "somebody most of you know".  I think the reality divergence and recursive/reflexive possibilities are huge, and potentially hilarious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
