From what I've heard about Sorcerer, it sounds like that's exactly how it works in that game. I'm kind of stuck at this point in my design, so I decided to come here and ask a few questions:<br/><br/>Can you explain to me a few things about Sorcerer? <br/><br/>1. How do you decide how much of the "damage" is temporary and how much is lasting?<br/>2. How long does "lasting" damage last?<br/>3. Is there any lasting damage from social conflicts, or other non-physical conflicts? Or do you just get bonus dice on one followup roll?<br/><br/>I'll be extra happy if you have some insight into _why_ the answers to those questions are what they are, and how it affects play, but that's, like, extra credit or something.<br/><br/>Thank you all for your help, as always.<br/><br/><br/>Paul T.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138464/#Comment_138464" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T02:27:34+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  2:27AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul,<br/><br/>1. There's a damage chart for that, where for example damage from fists or bludgeoning weapons do X successes temporary plus 1 lasting damage.<br/>2. All lasting damage lasts until the end of the entire conflict (whereas temporary only goes into the following 'round'). After the conflict ends, lasting damage is halved, and that rest stays with you until you do something about it (medical help, whatever).<br/>3. No, but bonus dice yes. Unless of course you have some weird kind of demonic power that does "social damage", that would be possible. But that's colour I suppose, it still would be either non-lethal or lethal special damage according to the rules.<br/><br/>Remember that a point of damage (lasting or not) is part of Sorcerer's currency and subtracts from any roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138571/#Comment_138571" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T11:54:41+00:00" title="April  7, 2008 11:54AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to refine what Per said.<br/><br/>1) For physical damage there's a chart that converts Victories on the die roll into Temporary and Lasting penalties depending on the type of weapon used.  These penalties affect ALL your scores and thus ALL interactions.<br/><br/>2) Temporary penalties only affect your next action.  Lasting affect all actions and are halved at the end of a scene.<br/><br/>3) There are no such penalties for social conflict.  In 99% of cases just rolling the victories as a bonus into another roll is sufficient.  However, it would not be outside the scope of the rules to have "lasting" penalties that affect a *specific* type of interaction.  For example, let's say there's a guy who rough ups his girlfriend.  So, you come and intimidate him about staying away from her and score two victories.  It wouldn't be unreasonable to apply a two-die penalty to the boyfriend for EVERY interaction he has with the girlfriend.  But again, that is pretty rare.  This is, in fact, how Binding rituals work.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138658/#Comment_138658" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T06:08:06+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  6:08AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, fellows!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138662/#Comment_138662" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T06:37:29+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  6:37AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since we're on the topic, has death in Sorcerer been discussed anywhere?

Let's be clear. It's not "undefined."  At 2 X Stamina a character is DYING and will die unless tended to with intensive care.  So, does the fiction allow this to happen?  Does any character take action to make this happen?  The Players at the table make decisions about this.  But it's not willy-nilly handwaving. When that threshold is reached, decisions must be made <i>NOW</i>.<br/><br/>2) You can play <i>Sorcerer</i> with any-sided die you want.  The rules discuss this, actually.  Basically, the larger the die, the larger the odds are to have more decisive victories.  d20s will produce more victories in a roll, while d4s will produce a closer range of results, and thus, less emphatic victories.  d10s are the default, because those the dice Ron uses, and uses as examples in the book.<br/><br/>3) <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> allows PCs who do not have bound Demons, so yes, it is possible by the rules.  However, significantly, Sorcerer &amp; Sword expands the rules one can use for sorcery, in introducing Pacts with Demons.  Pacts are "deals" with Demons, while a Binding is like a "relationship" with a Demon.  The significance lies in the fact that if a PC decides he needs to get access to more power it is available -- through Binding and Pacts -- and Pacts make getting power less of a long term commitment.  Remember that dealing with Demons is a stick and carrot a PC can grab for because it makes getting things done easier. But a Sorcerer might end up banishing his own demon, or having it banished by another PC, in which case he'd have to contact, summon and bind a new demon.  Or not.  The Player, of course, makes the choice of how far the PC will go, and by what means.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly what you mean by defining Demons as "mundane/real."  I've come up with 6 things you might mean, so could you clarify?<br/><br/>4) There's no problem as far as I know.  But it's one of those things that is experienced best in play.<br/><br/>The key is that the Player "receives" the information from the die roll ("He did beat my Will!" or "He didn't beat my Will!") and then makes a decision on how to proceed on behalf of the PC.<br/><br/>Last weekend I was playing Sorcerer &amp; Sword.  My guy was trying to kill another PC.  The PC I'm trying to kill shouts, "I'm trying to help you save your fiance!"  He made Will roll against my Will.  He won.  If I continued, I'd be attack with his successes tacked onto his next rool.<br/><br/>I have a choice.  I either press on.  Or don't.  <br/><br/>I chose not to press on, and the other Player's PC and my PC joined forces.<br/><br/>Ron and I were talking about this a couple of weeks ago and he pointed out this happens a lot.  Players are given, through the color added which is attached the die roll, a bit of information that gives them pause.  Sometimes they take the "hit" and change their course of action (as in the example above), and sometimes they press on with the odds not worse against them.<br/><br/>It seems like it <i>would</i> lead to problems.  But it doesn't. It just dumps a choice on the Player, informed by the details of the fiction.  It works fine.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138975/#Comment_138975" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T08:04:33+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  8:04AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Is it possible to play regular people in Sorcerer?

I've read many posts which attempt to explain Sorcerer's metaphors by way of addiction (the alcohol gives him strength, but could destroy everything he loves) and similarly mundane subjects. It's easy to see the base source material - mainly, Goethe's Faust - as allegory for all manners of mundane dramatic dilemmas. Considering this, it seems easy to adapt Sorcerer to include "mundanes" as PCs.<br/><br/>But there are other considerations, such as "Lore" and Telltales, which only "sorcerers" and "demons" possess. How do you translate that into an addiction theme? Those mechanical bits imply a secret world only sorcerers can access, which goes contrary to the idea of mundane demons and sorcerers. This is mirrored by some comments I received <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25808.msg248305#msg248305" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for example:\n<blockquote>Functional Sorcerer play demands that demons are unnatural abominations that must not, cannot, <i>do not </i>exist.</blockquote>\nI'm not convinced of why this is, and to be honest I think Peter's statement is only semi-correct, but there is definitely <i>something there</i> which states that translating demons into perfectly mundane things, which implies anyone and everyone is or could be a sorcerer, somehow breaks the game.<br/><br/>The translation of Kult into Sorcerer terms I'm working on intentionally messes with this idea, but the "secret world" of Kult states that every human is a deity in denial. Thus, everyone can technically be a sorcerer (and some are without knowing it) but demons are more or less defined by their detachment from the mundane.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138989/#Comment_138989" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T08:49:23+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  8:49AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2008 10:02AM by Per_Fischer.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "mundane demons and sorcerers", Mikael, but there's certainly scope in Sorcerer to colour what demons and sorcerers are just the way you want and still jam on the game's big metaphor of dysfunctional relationships. A demon could be a telephone, a police badge, a copy of your grandmother, a white layer of mist, a monkey, a lump in a blood vein, a bottle of gin or a slithering snake demon etc.<br/><br/>An addiction theme could be enforced by having demonic needs of taking drugs, drinking alcohol, having sex in the middle of the road, whatever.

Are you assuming that "Demons" are bat-winged monsters from hell with forked tales?  Cause they're not.  Demons are things that don't belong here, that people have summoned to gain the power they need to do the things they want.<br/><br/>Here's a quick description of a game I started up last week.  I sent this out as part of an email to my players a few weeks ago:<br/><br/><b>The Brotherood<br/><br/>You\u2019re all Prisoners in state penitentiary located in the middle of nowhere somewhere between Los Angeles and San Francisco.<br/><br/>Your character might have been guilty.  He might have been innocent.  But he ended up in The System.  <br/><br/>Your character knew no sorcery before getting into prison.  But there are a few teachers there \u2014 people who know how to get by by summoning the unnatural powers within the walls of the old prison.<br/><br/>Demons are tattoos, shivs, razor blades, cocaine, cigarettes, money, shadows, pin-ups, fantasies of the world outside and all things prison.  <br/><br/>The Lore of Sorcery are acts of domination and submission between men.<br/><br/>Humanity is standing up for your own moral code.<br/><br/>It\u2019s important to remember that the word \u201cdemon\u201d in this game doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthings from hell.\u201d  Think more of the girl from \u201cThe Ring\u201d -- where something has gone WRONG with the fabric of reality.  We\u2019re building our own specific and self-contained story, with it\u2019s own specific mythology and world.  <br/></b><br/><br/>The PCs we created last week are: <br/><br/>1) a Lifer in the prison who's demon is a cell block; he doesn't want to leave because he's very comfortable where he is.<br/><br/>2) a man who committed a crime and bound a demon to confront the sorcerous cult leader who rules his nationwide organization from inside the prison.  (The cult killed the man's daughter.)  His demons are the tattoo of Desert Eagle on his arm that allow him to produce a gun in his hand whenever he wants, and a second demon that is the tattoo of a third eye on his forehead that let's him "astrally" project when he mediates on the cot of his cell and learn more about what's happening many places.<br/><br/>3) a corrupt cop sent to jail for killing a fellow police officer who summoned and bound a demon to survive a place where cops are the biggest targets short of child molesters.  HIs demon are tattoos that cover his body (he looks just like a criminal now!) that let him to internal damage to people and let him withstand a lot of damage... All while looking like all he did was maybe give you a friendly slap on the shoulder.  The tattoos shift and change, showing a collage of all pepole he beat the hell out of.<br/><br/>In <i>Sorcerer</i>, each group (for each fresh story) creates the parameters of Demon, Lore and Humanity.<br/><br/>Does that answer your question any?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139002/#Comment_139002" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T09:29:14+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  9:29AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2008 9:34AM by lachek.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, see, Per, none of that makes any sense to me. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying I don't understand.<br/><br/>I've never played Sorcerer. I'm gearing up for it. But you say "as is", as if Sorcerer has a default setting, which it does not. I own <i>Mu</i> but I can't imagine playing it without playing something more straightforward (mundane?) first. The Kult hack is my attempt at translating something I know and where the players can feel fairly at home to fill in the blanks of Sorcerer without compromising the game of Sorcerer itself.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm not wracking my brain over this. It's very straightforward. I have all my terms and translations in place and they all work out in theory. We will see how it works in play, but I'm fairly confident. I'm not bringing this up to rehash a Forge conversation and hijack Paul's thread, I just wanted to offer my thoughts and sympathy regarding this IMHO unclear segment of Sorcerer setting creation.<br/><br/>Here's what I don't get, and I hope this can help Paul with his question as well.<br/><br/>#1: How can you say "a demon could be a telephone, a police badge, a copy of your grandmother, a white layer of mist, a monkey, a lump in a blood vein, a bottle of gin" and reconcile that with Lore, Humanity and Telltales? I can see how the stats might be translated to work such that you can "Contact" and "Summon" and "Bind" a bottle of gin, although it's a big stretch. I can see how you might define Humanity such that you may experience a loss of it when dealing with alcohol. I can see what a Telltale of being an alcoholic might be, too. But what about "demons want to hide their presence from humanity"? What about "only a sorcerer can interpret the meaning of a Telltale"? What about the whole <i>mystique</i> of being a sorcerer, essentially a human who can solve all his problems (he thinks) by cheating? What prevents anyone from becoming a sorcerer, when demons are something so mundane? Why wouldn't every power-grubbing jerk in the world be a hardcore alcoholic?<br/><br/>#2: How can you say "reality is real and demons do not exist", when demons are as mundane as telephones, police badges or a bottle of gin? Or do you mean that demons are not those things, but some sort of idea which manifests as those things? That the sorcerer "imbues" these mundane things with demons, which cause the dysfunctional relationship to occur? That demons are ultimately fictional, and all sorcerer/demon conflicts are really internal conflicts within the sorcerer? I can appreciate the allegorical mumbo-jumbo, but it's sure as hell not necessary for Sorcerer play to occur, seeing how these notions are nowhere to be found in the core text. It has also been oft-repeated, by Ron and others, that Sorcerer play often result in demonic ass-kicking with no particular nod towards allegory or philosophical statements.<br/><br/>Paul, if none of this helps and/or confuse the issues, let me know and I'll make this a whisper.<br/><br/>EDIT: Per, is there a link to one-sheets?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139018/#Comment_139018" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T10:03:44+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 10:03AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2008 10:07AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a page with a lot of <i>Sorcerer</i> <a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php?title=Sorcerer:_A_Menu&amp;printable=yes" rel="nofollow">games, one sheets and descriptions.</a><br/><br/>It might be time for a new thread, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139055/#Comment_139055" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T11:24:03+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 11:24AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mikael,<br/><br/>The whole demons do not exist thing really bugged me for the longest time.

So let's put that aside for a minute.  To be perfectly clear, everything I'm about to say applies in full to the 100% supernatural context of Sorcerer.  Slavering fanged monsters chained in my basement, rune covered rings that let me turn invisible, a misty serpent thing that whispers the secrets of the universe in my ear. <br/><br/>Okay given ALL THAT.  The words "hidden world" do not apply to Sorcerer.  There is no "hidden world."  Sorcerer's do not "see reality for what it is" or anything like that.  Sorcerer takes place in the here and now world as you and I understand it.<br/><br/>What that means in practice:<br/><br/>There are no Sorcerer/Demon only agendas.  Anything a Sorcerer would be "up to" is anything you and I would be up to.  I once played a Sorcerer game set in post-Katrina New Orleans.  What the PCs cared about were things like family safety, preservation of property, establishing legacy.  The content was supernatural as all get out but what was "at stake" in story terms was everyday ordinary family politics in the wake of a disaster.<br/><br/>Another important aspect is moral accountability.  Demons, even when acting supposedly on their own, are an extension of the Sorcerer.  A Sorcerer can not escape moral accountability because his "demon did it."  The demon is only here, because he WILLED it to be here.  In real world terms he can not escape the consequences of the real world by shunting responsibility on to the demon.  If the police can find even a shred of evidence linking the Sorcerer to a crime (even one that the forensics team can't quite explain) they are coming after the Sorcerer.<br/><br/>This is why playing a "mundane" makes almost no sense.  As soon as a character had any kind of *meaningful* interaction with a demon that was not simply shunted off by denial their Lore score would become one.  Congratulations they are a Sorcerer in game terms.  No special training, indoctrination or being "let in on the hidden world."  There is no "hidden world"  Sorcerers are not in on a special party no one else is invited too.  They're just arrogant strong willed people, who wanted something so badly, they found a way (quite likely of their own devising) to bring this *thing* that does not belong here to help them out.<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139078/#Comment_139078" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T12:22:13+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 12:22PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2008 5:59PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cross posted with Jesse (and I agree with what he wrote -- especially about mundane vs. supernatural muddying things....<br/><br/>Here's a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24324.0" rel="nofollow">thread</a> where Ron lays out a couple of posts on this matter.<br/><br/>It thought these quotes from the thread do a good job of laying it out:<br/><br/><i>More profoundly, not only are there not several ways sorcery works, there is no actual way that sorcery "works in the setting."  In fact, it's fundamental to the concept of the game that there is no magic, and that demons do not exist. That's why Sorcerer is not about hidden secrets about the universe that only a few people know; it's about the few people who have defied the universe they live in. That's also why types and styles of sorcery, in a given setting, do not reflect setting but rather characters.</i><br/><br/>and this...<br/><br/><i>In Sorcerer, belief doesn't mean shit. Reality, whatever it may be, cares nothing for human belief. Such belief is limited to within the human experience and can only "talk to itself."<br/><br/>So where do demons come from? The answer is, they don't. There aren't demons. They don't exist. Reality doesn't permit demons to exist. Demons are not in the setting, not in another dimension, not in Hell, and not in any sort of alternate or even psychological space.<br/><br/>Demons don't exist.<br/><br/>So that means that not only do demons not exist, they aren't created either. You can't explain them as psi-manifestations or psychological effects on reality either, because all of that is just more "this is why they exist" explanations. You have to throw out any and all justification of demons' presence, at the level of understanding the setting.<br/><br/>That's what I mean by defying the universe to be a sorcerer. You don't just whip into existence some sort of "thing" which you happen to believe in. That's boring, just more magical thinking. Magical thinking is expressly stupid and meaningless in Sorcerer.<br/><br/>No, to get a demon and Bind it, in Sorcerer, means the character stepped fully outside any and all explanations of any kind. The character had to break the universe to do it. No one can explain it, most especially anything resembling "order" or "purpose" in the universe, if indeed there is such a thing, and equally, anything like "the power lies within you" as well.<br/><br/>Sorcerer settings are full of rationalizations of sorcery, but that's all Lore is. I want to emphasize that this sentence applies fully to faith-based and emotion-based explanations too.</i><br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/steven807" title="steven807"><img alt="steven807" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/steven807">steven807</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139135/#Comment_139135" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T16:49:01+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  4:49PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2008 4:51PM by steven807.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I now understand it, then I'd say the statement "demons do not exist" is a really poor way of communicating the concept.

But it sounds like the<em>intent</em>of the concept is:<br><br>* Demons cannot be explained.<br/><br/>In other words, there is no secret "science", that one person can learn from another. Binding a demon requires will, not knowledge.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nThe way I'm seeing it is that the whole binding/Demon thing is kind of what it feels like to the character, or possibly how she explains it to herself.<br/><br/>But it's not necessarily true. Through a decision, an act of will, the sorcerer has messed up reality somewhat. Maybe. But no one, including the sorcerer themselves, really knows or understands what's going on.<br/><br/>Does that sound like we're on the same page?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139187/#Comment_139187" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T00:05:34+00:00" title="April 11, 2008 12:05AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul,<br/><br/>Did you miss my answer to you d6 question upthread?  Did it not answer your question?<br/><br/>I wrote:<br/><br/><i>You can play Sorcerer with any-sided die you want. The rules discuss this, actually. Basically, the larger the die, the larger the odds are to have more decisive victories. d20s will produce more victories in a roll, while d4s will produce a closer range of results, and thus, less emphatic victories. d10s are the default, because those the dice Ron uses, and uses as examples in the book.</i><br/><br/>So, d6's will not provide as many decisive victories as d10s.  (In other words, there will be more ties among the dice, and fewer Victory dice gained and rolled into the next roll.)  When someone succeeds in a conflict using d6's, they succeed with fewer Victories and so have fewer bonus to carry over into the next roll than if they were rolling d10's.  <br/><br/>Does that work for you?<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/steven807" title="steven807"><img alt="steven807" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/steven807">steven807</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139248/#Comment_139248" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T08:25:28+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  8:25AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2008 8:26AM by steven807.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I said above, trying to interpret previous comments in this thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: steven807</cite><br/>there is no secret "science", that one person can learn from another.

The problem when discussing this "demons don't exist" issue or "what does lore mean" issue is that it causes people to do an unproductive two-step.  One shifts between a discussion about narrative devices to be used and discarded as a matter of artistic choice and trying to construct a mental "model" of the game world.<br/><br/>One of the things I don't like about the Dresden Files is that Dresden is WAY too chatty in his head.  In particular he's very chatty about how magic "works."  So I could easily see a fan crawling through all the novels to date and pulling out the rules for magic that Dresden muses about and proclaiming that "In the Dresdenverse this is how magic works."  That fan then goes out and gives some other fan's work of fanfic a hard time because he "doesn't understand how magic works in the Dresdenverse."  Or he role-plays with his friends in the "Dresdenverse" and one of his players pro-offers up an idea but he shoots it down on the basis that, "No, that's not how magic works in the Dresdenverse."<br/><br/>And all of that kind of thinking doesn't apply to Sorcerer.  Sorcerer doesn't model anything.  It lays down a set of narrative concepts for addressing a certain range of issues.  So, yes, in your created fiction you might very well have a master imparting the principles of sorcery onto a student as the basis for your Lore.  Hell, we might even as a group go ahead and spell those principles out.  But all we're really saying is, "This is how it 'works' right up until it doesn't"  No one is allowed to deny someone else's creative input on that basis.<br/><br/>For example, we might agree that all Sorcery has to involve a family heirloom.  But then three or four sessions in someone starts describing a ritual and another player says, "What's your family heirloom?"  And the player performing the ritual says, "That's just it, I don't have one."  The only appropriate response from the group is a shocked gasp exactly as would happen from an audience watching such a story.  No one can go, "But we agreed that Sorcery requires a family heirloom.  That's how magic in this setting *works*"<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139293/#Comment_139293" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T11:41:31+00:00" title="April 11, 2008 11:41AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>I don't know what vitamins you're taking, but you are a roll these days with clarity and authority.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/steven807" title="steven807"><img alt="steven807" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/steven807">steven807</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139333/#Comment_139333" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T15:22:00+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  3:22PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seem to have derailed Paul's thread a bit -- sorry about that, Paul! :-)<br/><br/>Jesse: Yup, it makes sense!  In fact, even as I was typing my previous response, I realized I was falling a little into the trap of saying what the setting "really is".<br/><br/>I followed up on this topic because my confusion about "demons don't exist" actually dissuaded me from playing (or rather, GMing) Sorcerer.  The issue was not a question of setting, but rather that it was such a provocative statement (being paradoxical and all), that I figured it was important.<br/><br/>A larger issue, BTW, is that I'm relatively new to story games, and I'm not a game designer.  My first (and probably 2nd and 3rd) effort at playing a new game, I'm going to trust that the game was playtested well, so I'm going to play the game straight, rather than modifying it.  I'm not going to say "no, demons do exist" if the text says the opposite.<br/><br/>All is clear now.
