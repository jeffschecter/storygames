I'll feature all the games I played in, in chronological order.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.hamsterprophetproductions.com/wordpress/?page_id=25" rel="nofollow">carry</a> run by <a href="http://earthenforge.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Rachel Walton</a>:</b> I played Ram, the Sgt. This is the second time I played him. Last time he was secretly gay, this time he was obsessed with the Warrior Spirit and hadn't killed anyone yet, with 10 months on the front lines. It was a very good game with some over-the-top silliness (typified by <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/" rel="nofollow">Jason Morningstar</a>'s Temple advocating rigging some watermelons to blow up when the VC got to them. In the last game I was able to geek out a lot more on the blending of the mechanics and the fictional issues of leadership. This time, what I tried to do wound up being far more hapless. I found it less satisfying, but that's because things didn't go well for me, and I was suffering from an attack of myguyism. It was still a lot of fun.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://judd-sonofbert.livejournal.com/tag/1q" rel="nofollow">1st Quest</a> run by <a href="http://judd-sonofbert.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Judd Karlman</a>:</b> This is a <a href="http://crngames.com/the_shadow_of_yesterday/index" rel="nofollow">Solar-System</a>-based game Judd is still writing. We played kids held hostage by the court of the sleeping Emperor in a consciously-anachronistic Samurai setting. I loved my character in this game, so much so that I sometimes felt guilty, like I was hogging the spotlight. She was totally the trickster archetype that I love <i>so fucking much</i>. In fact, by the end of the game I had switched out both of my banners (keys) for Banner of the Secret Girl and Banner of the Wise Fool. That Wise Fool shit had better end up in the final game, Judd! Anyway, I gamed the shit out of the system to transcend and become the Empress (with the male soul of the past emperor caged within me).<br/><br/><b><a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a> run by <a href="http://indie-insurgent.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">me</a>:</b> This was the first game of MY where I got to try the <a href="http://indie-insurgent.livejournal.com/42817.html" rel="nofollow">new scene framing rules</a> which worked perfectly. I'm so excited, as this is the last piece I think the game needs. ANYway, this game was in a future Detroit which had had all of its social services sold to a faith-based organization, Relocation Services, Inc. Their faith, however, was free-market fundamentalism. They wanted to drive out or kill anyone who didn't contribute economically in the right way. The YOs were chased on several sides by the drug-induced zombies, and eventually wound up figuring out how to turn them on or off. The stand-out moment is when Witt's character led the attack on the police station, and curb-stomped her own father. The way he rallied the "troops," it really felt like Witt had led street protests before. That was sweet.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/sis.html" rel="nofollow">Sign in Stranger</a> run by <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/aboutus.html" rel="nofollow">Emily Care Boss</a>:</b> I fucking love this game. The creative-writing-exercise-laden mechanics that Emily does so well make me smile. It's an alien first contact sci fi game crossed with Mad Libs, kindasorta. I played Else Stonem, an English/German former sex worker from Amsterdam who got training to become a biotech engineer and was sent to a cold little moon with a these mole-people who communicated by scent and had as their helpers another intelligent species of very small, floating balls of stuff that were so cold they precipitated snow. I got really interested in consuming the (cannibalistic) food of the prime species and studying its effects, and pretty much everyone else was furious at me for it.<br/><br/><b>Misspent Youth run by me again</b>: We were dithering on the setup for this one until Connie said, "Evil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Roslin" rel="nofollow">Laura Roslin</a>," and we all oohed and aahed and were hooked. A huge flying city of a colony ship where the past no longer existed with a matriarchal, monarchical "presidency," where the kids were oppressed by a caste system that was theoretically a meritocracy based on placement tests. We had one character who was, at 13, told she would be a prostitute (played by Sarah); another who was a female Indiana Jones and led the kids into exploring abandoned sections of the ship (played by Joanna); the heir apparent to the presidency who was a reluctant rebel (played by Connie); and a geeky apple polisher who appeared to be wrapped around the ladies' collective finger (played by Chad). We had a plot by the ship's second-class males (all hyphenate relatives of President Smith) to try to supplant the matriarchy and to make money to do so by including sexbots among the real prostitutes. Authority Figures included a beastmaster who controlled all the robot animals from a secret lair and a sleazy government pimp who had an excruciating scene where he tried to recruit the heir into The Life (not knowing who she was). This game was a real highlight of the con for me. I also loved the uncomfortable inter-group conflict about the attraction between Chad and Sarah's character. It was difficult to do, from a technical rules perspective, and I think it was that difficulty that rendered the resulting back and forth so much more tender and real.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194680/#Comment_194680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T17:42:29+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  5:42PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><a href="http://www.glyphpress.com/shock/" rel="nofollow">shock:</a> facilitated by me</b>: This was the famous game where <a href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/" rel="nofollow">Joshua</a> took on 12 players by splitting into three tables. The common shock was non-carbon-based lifeforms found on Earth. Our issues were faith, economic inequality, and information transparency, of which I (the atheist) owned faith. We had a scientist trying to prove and publicize the aliens' intelligence, a CEO who needed to break out of his complacency, a class-action lawyer who had to lose everything before he could find himself, and a former war hero turned prophet who needed to rediscover the meaning of faith. The aliens' bodies were used to create a miracle drug which could cure any sickness (for a price), which also brought on ecstatic visions from "angels." We were totally set to have happy endings for people but we ran out of time.<br/><br/><b>Misspent Youth again by me again</b>: For some reason I can't put my finger on, this game felt <i>very</i> different from every other MY game I've ever played in. It was set in a post-apocalypse in a town built on top of a barely-functioning oil refinery which was terrorized by a motorcycle gang called The Red Men, led by Lady Jacks (who was The Authority), a former soldier and the smartest person in her gang. The game had this great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series)" rel="nofollow">Dark-Tower</a>-like mash-up of Mad Max and western. The town was totally cowed by the Red Men, who would let no one have a motor vehicle, had access to high-tech weaponry (like a laser-firing tank!!), and were considered cool by most of the kids in town. Our heroes were the secret nerds, who would wander through the tunnels that ran all throughout the town and preserve books and teach one another things. Dave's character was obsessed by this tank we found, and fixated on it, to the point where it became annoying out of game. Which was fucking AWESOME, because it was supposed to be annoying! The signature conflict was definitely where Rich had to sell out. He was the leader, and a "mutie," who sold out his tough, independent streak to become a sniveling manipulator to get a new family on their side. It hurt me, as was appropriate.<br/><br/>This was a great con for me. I'm still floating on the after-con endorphins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194722/#Comment_194722" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-27T01:08:06+00:00" title="February 27, 2009  1:08AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As noted in your LJ,<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinfest#Criminy" rel="nofollow">Criminy</a> from <i>Sinfest</i> was my initial character inspiration.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Sinfest-Criminy.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194733/#Comment_194733" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-27T04:37:55+00:00" title="February 27, 2009  4:37AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>over-the-top silliness</blockquote>\nNot my fault.

I think we had six characters and most of them felt mis-understood and alone. I left the game feeling really bad for them. They left earth (never to return) and could not get along with each other. Trapped on a world of cannibal mole people and little floating motes of cold for companions and forced to catch alien rats. <br/>\n<br/>\nit has to be one of the saddest ending i have ever encountered (including the TPK Mountain Witch later that day).

I've been mulling this over. Maybe I'll start a thread on it. In every carry game I've been a part of, there's been at least a touch of unevenness in terms of how invested each player is, and I think it has a lot to do with what makes a good set of burdens. Jason and Paul seemed to have the most accessible burden sets (that is, easily brought into the game by both me and them) and thus had a little more screen time. The rest of you had more vague burdens, or they were harder to set up specific scenes for (although in hindsight, I have a few more ideas now).
