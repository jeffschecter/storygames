I spent hours drawing maps, monsters, copying from manuals, or just browsing for illustrations to copy or tinker with.<br/>And at the same time, I was on my journey to discover Queen (and the pain of being a teenager desperate and in love, but that's a whole different story).<br/>Innuendo was one of the first CDs I bought (most of my music back then was on tape) and it would play in my stereo endlessly. I mean, literally, for hours and hours... I was switching from child music or my parents' or older friends' music, to the music that I liked.<br/>I understood perhaps a word or two, so actually I had no idea what the Queen songs meant.<br/><br/>So Queen became the soundtrack, in my head, of fantasy RPGs.<br/>And now I find that coupling these two activities, listening to Queen music and reading old fantasy RPG manuals, takes me on a strong, powerful memory trip back to those days.<br/><br/>So, then: do you guys have anything like that? (or something of the sort...)<br/>Do you have a "soundtrack" of your games when you were teenagers that is meaningful only to you?

I have an Ableton Launchpad, and whomever is GM get to program it with songs. It is much less intrusive than having the pc at your table, or searching on some app on a connected phone. Then, whenever the GM wants a certain piece, they just click the right button.\n<blockquote><br/>Do you have a "soundtrack" of your games when you were teenagers that is meaningful only to you? Care to share?<br/></blockquote>\nFor giant dragons, dancing leprechauns and bloodthirsty blessed beasts:<br/>The Dark Souls 1/2 Ost.<br/>Heroes 3 Ost.<br/>Bloodborne Ost<br/><br/>For dark, woody, nordic ambience - ancient as the archtrees themselves:<br/>Wardruna <br/>Ulf S\xf6derberg<br/>Sephiroth <br/><br/>for horror:<br/>Ugsanie<br/>Halgrath<br/><br/>Yup. That is the music we use - and boy are the tracks memory-laden.<br/>A side effect that our dependency on music has, is that without music or ambience, it just is not the same for us. We have jaded ourselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
