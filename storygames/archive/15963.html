We had no cleric, amusingly, but I said a Paladin would be okay, so he had the Blue Crystal Staff. Paladin, fighter, thief, and wizard: great party!<br/><br/>It was really nice to have a map to refer to, and to just know what elements and factions were in play and to just improvise wildly based on that. I did a fair amount of prep - 1 Campaign Front and 2 Dungeon Fronts, and a bunch of monster stats. Most of it didn't get used; I felt like the module map and room descriptions (which I didn't hew to very closely--too many pointless encounters) took the place of a lot of that stuff. But it was nice to have!<br/><br/>The Thief, by the way, was a kender. We replaced the +1 damage with ranged weapons with "When you mercilessly taunt a number of enemies up to your level, roll +Cha. On a 10+, the target(s) can do nothing but goggle apoplectically until you stop taunting or they come under immediate physical threat. On a 7-9, they can do nothing but attack/chase you."<br/><br/>In the end, largely thanks to some judicious use of this talent by the Thief (Rob Bohl: no longer allowed to play Kender), they did get the MacGuffin, and used the Blue Crystal Staff to scare the dragon away, but got a 7-9 on that so I ruled that the dragon got off one attack on the Paladin, killing him instantly.<br/><br/>As an aside: the damage numbers in Beta 1.1 are *nuts*. I cut them in half.<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363187/#Comment_363187" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T20:41:03+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  8:41PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you going to run the rest of the DL modules like this?<br/><br/>Did you notice the Fighter's advanced move for taunting?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite><br/>As an aside: the damage numbers in Beta 1.1 are *nuts*.

I was simply having the enemy "make an attack," generally with the PC having a chance to respond and avoid. I just wasn't at all happy with the way the numbers looked from the rules. Even a weak enemy doing something like 12 damage? Seems too much. I was very happy having the basic Baaz draconian do like 6 damage.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363594/#Comment_363594" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T18:05:22+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  6:05PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 6:05PM by Anarchangel.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite><cite>Posted By: Anarchangel</cite>Are you going to run the rest of the DL modules like this?</blockquote>\nWould be cool!
