<p>I though it'd be neat to have a resource of magical-logic rules for when we need to rapidly portray someone being magic, along teh lines of Contagion and Similarity. So post a rule and an example.</p>
<p><strong>Counterchanging</strong><br/>
Similar situations tend to dissimilate.</p>
<p>The vizier sees that courtiers are moving to kill the sultan, so he takes an iron chess set and plays a game with him. One move before the vizier checkmates the sultan, someone interrupts the game and the vizier locks the chessboard away, the pieces undisturbed. As long as the chess sultan remains doomed, the flesh sultan is safe.</p>

                            Isn't that a little like Sympathetic magic?<br/><br/>I think a lot of mileage can be gained in trying to write brief laws (depending on the campaign) of how Magical Energy is gained/used (not neciss. How It Works, just How it Can Be Used).<br/><br/>Like, in the Coldfire Trilogy (fun books), magic, called the Fey, is a wispy substance, usually unseeable, that cracks up and pours over the surface of the seismically-active earth like a stew. No one can see it, save gifted "adepts" (who inherit the condition at birth). Fae erupts into the world "hot" with every often occuring earthquake, and if you use "hot fae", you can do powerful things, but it tends to explode your brain and kill you. Also, Fae is great at doing temporary magical-seeming things (remain hidden, influence people, enhance skills, etc) but there are no "fireball effects". The greatest mage in the world had to put all his effort and energy into making a permanent physical magic effect: A small knife that couldn't be scryed.<br/><br/>In Dark Sun, magic comes from life, usually plant life (higher level magics can affect animal life). When power for magic is summoned, plants in the area whither and die. You can use magic in ways that causes plants/life not to suffer, but it's taking the Long Road, and the more ambitious mages will gain power more quickly than you.<br/><br/>So, to that end:<br/><br/><b>Godspears</b> <br/><br/>Across the land, miles apart from each other, are huge obelisk-like structures that appear stabbed into the earth. Ebon of color and covered in etched runes, people born in the land have a strange natural attunement to them. "The can cast magic".  Magic, in this world, is all mental: Mostly it's the domain of what we would call subvocalization.  The further one travels from the godspears, the weaker the power of the caster. True mages leaving the land of the spears completely can still work magic, but only with extreme effort and concentration.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Yes, I like some sort of "Conservation of Magical Energy" law. Terry Pratchett used that a lot.<br/><br/>On another note...and this is a common one...<br/><br/><b>Spheres</b><br/><br/>You're limited over what spheres of magic you can influence.<br/><br/>A druid is in a large city, when he is accosted by thieves. He looks around for something he can use magic on, but all he sees is stone and iron. Then he senses downwards and finds tree roots beneath the paving slabs. With little effort, he causes them to burst up through the paving slabs and bind the thieves.                        </div>

<b>Watery Way</b><br/><br/>Magical energy resides solely in water.  Wizards and sorcerors live on islands or near the sea.  Large-scale magic always takes place during thunderstorms or blizzards.  Magical items are always made of metal or stone, which are sunk to the bottom of lakes to steep before they are ensorcelled.  Wizards are always thirsty, since their magical work costs a small volume of water in their bodies.  Therefore they drink constantly, and can be identified by their behavior.                        </div>

                            Here are the classic ones.  You may hate Bonewitz, but you gotta admit he was good at collecting this crap.<br/><br/><b>I. THE LAW OF CAUSE AND EFFECT:</b>  The same actions under the same conditions produce the same results.  A Law that is generally non demonstrable. Very few are skilled enough to replicate one of these conditions, much less all three of them simultaneously. Replicating one's actions exactly is difficult enough, but replicating the environment (which includes TIME) is another matter. <br/><br/>Corollary - <b>THE LAW OF RETURNS:</b>  "What one sends out, comes back." Or "What goes around, comes around."   The Three-fold Rule is an example of the Law of Returns.<br/><br/><b>II. THE LAW OF KNOWLEDGE:</b>  Greater understanding produces greater influence though greater affinity.  Greater affinity (kinship) with any manifestation leads to a more powerful response when aid is requested, much is as a good friend is more likely to help you out than a stranger.<br/><br/>Corollary - <b>THE LAW OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE:</b>  Greater understanding of self produces greater influence though greater affinity. <br/><br/><b>III. THE LAW OF NAMES:</b> Having greater knowledge of a manifestation's true and complete name leads to greater affinity and influence.<br/><br/>Corollary - <b>THE LAW OF WORDS OF POWER:</b>  Having greater knowledge of words of power leads to greater affinity and influence. <br/><br/><b>IV. THE LAW OF ASSOCIATION:</b> Greater common characteristics between two manifestations combined with greater knowledge of the commonalties produces greater affinity and influence.<br/><br/>Corollary 1 - <b>THE LAW OF SIMILARITY</b> (sympathetic magic):  Effects resemble causes.<br/><br/>Corollary 2 - <b>THE LAW OF CONTAGION:</b>  Two manifestations which have been in contact remain in contact.<br/><br/><b>V. THE LAW OF IDENTIFICATION:</b> Complete knowledge equals absolute affinity equals identity. <br/><br/><b>VI. THE LAW OF SYNTHESIS (or, the UNION of OPPOSITES):</b> Synthesis of two opposing views of reality, or 2 realities, engenders a third which is more real that either original.<br/>    Corollary - <b>THE LAW OF POLARITY:</b>  Any manifestation is divisible into two antithetical sets of attributes, each of which contain the essence of the other. <br/><br/><b>VII. THE LAW OF BALANCE:</b>  Greater balance is required for greater affinity and influence.<br/><br/><b>VIII. THE LAW OF INFITITE MANIFESTATIONS:</b> The number of manifestations within the Web is infinite. In other words, we'll never run out of manifestations to experience, or things to learn. <br/><br/><b>IX. THE LAW OF FINITE SENSES:</b>  A manifestation's (ie, our) ability to perceive limits its ability to know.  In other words, we can't see everything.<br/><br/><b>X. THE LAW OF PRAGMATISM:</b> If it works, it's right.<br/><br/><b>XI. THE LAW OF INFINITE UNIVERSES:</b>  As there are infinite manifestations within the web possessed of infinite views of the universe, there are infinite universes. <br/><br/><b>XII. THE LAW OF TRUE FALSEHOODS:</b>  Data exist which contradict your knowledge but which, never-the-less, are functional.  Or, If it's a paradox, it's probably true. <br/><br/><b>XIII. THE LAW OF PERSONIFICATION:</b>  All manifestations (including people) live and have personality.<br/><br/>    Corollary 1 - <b>THE LAW OF INVOCATION:</b> Any manifestation can conjure real entities from within.<br/><br/>    Corollary 2 - <b>THE LAW OF EVOCATION:</b>  A manifestation can conjure real entities from without.                        </div>

<b>The law of Equivalent Exchange</b><br/>
<br/>
In order to gain, something of equal value must be lost.<br/>
<br/>
Example: A necromancer wishes to reanimate an ally who has been slain. In order to bring back this life, the life of another will have to be lost -- a sacrifice, or suicide on the part of the necromancer if they're too altruistic for that shit.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Law of Emanations</b><br/>
<br/>
All emanations are functions of the events that cause them. All creations are thus under the control of their creators.<br/>
<br/>
Example: A wizard grows three large and terrifying homunculi in their vats. These beasts are under the wizard's absolute control.                        </div>

<b>The Law of Opposition</b><br><br>Mundanity is opposed to magic.<br><br>1&gt; Places where people do ordinary things (sleep, eat, work, play, etc) in ordinary ways are antithetical to magic.  It's nearly impossible to do magic in a city, and damn hard in any settled area.  On the other hand, places that have been ritually prepared for magic, and used for nothing else, are especially powerful places to work it.<br><br>2&gt; Doing completely ordinary things with magic (making food, for example) are nearly impossible to do with magic.

<i>Fred beat me to the Bonewits! Everything else that folks have posited fits into those categories. </i><br><br>Oh, I beg to differ;).<br/><br/>While the law of mediation might seem to fall under the Law of Synthesis, it really diverges from it in some radical ways.  First, it does not posit that the synthesis is more real--it may be less real, even more tenuous.  It does not assume that the oppositions it mediates are, in fact, synthesizable--magic's impermanence can be read as resulting from the 'patch-bandaid' nature of the process.  You can unpack a principle of danger from this, which actually takes you off at a tangent from where Bonewitz ends up.<br/><br/>I think there is more to be had in a discussion about principles than just rehashing Bonewitz.                        </br></br></div>

<b>The Principle of Intention</b><br/><br/>Magic does what you mean, not what you think you mean.  In other words, magic takes into account your unconscious feelings and your long-term intentions and acts on those, not on the immediate effect that you're hoping for.<br/><br/>(This implies that magic is controllable in proportion to how little you are personally invested in the result, which I like.)<br/><br/>Example: Gerhard performs a spell to make some money, because he's broke and has to pay the rent.  The spell doesn't bring him any cash, but his landlord has a heart attack and dies, leaving the estate in the hands of his wife who, in her grief, fails to collect rent this month.                        </div>

<p>OK, rock.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>We live in the set of dimensions called the Keil by the Kauhei. They are humans bound to the MaÃƒÂ¼fa, the dimensions of the Elements (all six: Fire, Water; Air, Earth; Entropy, Chaos). The MaÃƒÂ¼fa are dimensions that touch our three dimensions orthogonally; by geometrically transforming itself, a tree grows and blossoms, withers and dies, swinging like a pendulum in the Third MaÃƒÂ¼faic Dimension. These transformations can be learned by humans, and indeed, all magic is the performance of complex engineering in the six dimensions.</p>
<p>The MaÃƒÂ¼fa touches other dimensions, as well: those of the DaÃƒÂ¶at Mo, the Prison. Entrapped therein are the Sunken, the losers of a great war nearly 6000 years ago. The MaÃƒÂ¼fa was devised as a buffer zone between the DaÃƒÂ¶at Mo and the Keil by the Treasure, a race of beings who, though battered and bruised, nonetheless earned their dominion over Earth and the Universe we know.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, the MaÃƒÂ¼fa has been a vast, infinite desert in total equilibrium. Neither Chaos nor Entropy have held sway, neither Fire nor Water are dominant, neither Air nor Earth have dominated the world.</p>
<p>But first, an area dried, and when that happened, another became wetter. Air and Earth became separate. The pendulum of Chaos and Entropy began to swing. Life was coming to the MaÃƒÂ¼fa. Now strange creatures cross its terrain, and a race of humans Ã¢â‚¬â€ a creation of the Treasure Ã¢â‚¬â€ has been seen. Nomads, they travel the wastes of the MaÃƒÂ¼fa and learn how to squeeze Entropy to gain Chaos, and live by that knowledge.</p>
<p>The humans of Earth have also learned, in fear of the Treasure finding what they know, the ways of Sacred Geometry. They raise the dead, turn lead to gold, set fire to the Air. And now their work has rent the membrane between worlds. On July 16, 1945, a tear was formed in the Mojave Desert. The tear was small, but raised the attention of the Sunken. They see a way back to the World. The Treasure are still weak, and the Sunken have festered in their own rage for millions of years, pushed back to the past by the Treasure to the beginning of the Universe, and defeated 65 million years ago. They want Earth and they sense that only humans stand between them and vengeance on the Treasure.</p>

<p><strong>Principle of the Royal Flag</strong><br/>
In the magical world, things must be ritually ratified, or they do not exist. One does not necessarily have to use a traditional ritual for a thing, but to do so lends the effort power.</p>
<p><em>If the mat was not straight, the Master would not sit.</em> Being steeped in this form of magic, Confucius could sit for a meal, but if he did not straighten his mat, <em>it was as though he ate nothing.</em></p>
<p><em>The King of Fairies signed a treaty not to steal from my kingdom,</em> but we did not fly his flag when he arrived, nor blow trumpets upon his departure, and so he is not bound by it.</p>

                            These are a little different -- they're really principles of genre story construction. I've sometimes found it useful to interpret them inside a game setting as operational rules of magic, though no <i>observable</i> cause and effect is ever involved in their operation.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Crabgrass Principle</b><br/>
<br/>
Possessions of a magical nature (or, often, any unusual nature) do not come into one's possession by happenstance. If you have it, you will need it. (The name derives from the maxim, <i>if the elves give you a magic ring of crabgrass, you will eventually have desperate need for crabgrass.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Secret Power of Secrets</b><br/>
<br/>
A secret is powerful magic. Reality will alter itself to protect a sufficiently powerful secret.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Contrariness of Magical Restrictions</b><br/>
<br/>
The best-known, strictest, most thoroughly proven law of magic is the one that must be broken to achieve transcendent magical power. For instance, if magic works only for virgins, then only a mage who gives in to passion can fully master it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Law of Caveat Emptor</b> (an instance of the Law of Returns)<br/>
<br/>
You get what you pay for. Gains achieved through magic must be compensated by sacrifice, toil, and hardship. The main difference between white and black magic is whether the payment is made in advance or afterward. (Harry Potter could not have become a great wizard if the Dursleys hadn't mistreated him.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The example I used for the Contrariness principle reminds me: there are lots of laws in the literature and traditions of magic that correlate sex and magic. For obvious reasons such laws haven't been popular in role playing magic systems. For equally obvious reasons they offer a lot of potential there.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Law of Nookie</b><br/>
<br/>
Sexual innocence, and it's opposite, totally committed sexual passion, both run parallel to the currents of magic and facilitate its use. Sexual confusion or dissatisfaction of any kind runs perpendicular to those currents and will impair magic or block it completely.<br/>

<p>I was thinking of a setting where magic is based on being different in some way. A part of your soul (or brain, or genes) is not of human origin (Atlantean blood, demonic offspring, possessed by an alien spirit, etc). That got me these:</p>
<p><strong>The Law of Susceptibility</strong></p>
<p>Those who can use magic are much more affected by magic than those who don't.</p>
<p>or more extreme...</p>
<p><strong>The Law of Exclusivity</strong></p>
<p>Only those that can work magic can be affected by magic.</p>

<p>This has me really rummaging through my esoterica. I have here this 2003 facsimile of MS 408, the Voynich Manuscript, that I'm surprised to discover has a slip of paper shoved into the pages that I hadn't noticed before. It's in Italian and written in a sepia pen.</p>
<p>It reads</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>"In questo scritto, dico questo a te, mio apprentide e mio cuore: sei tu la petra filosofica, la risponsa e la domanda. Guardi al' foglio ventiterzo: ti darrÃƒÂ¡ la machina per usare la tua natura a finire il lavoro del'universo. Allora, sei tu la donna nel'uomo, l'uomo nella donna. Le parte uniscati."</p>

<p>Google tells me that it means</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>In this written, I say this to you, mine apprentide and my heart:  six you philosophical it petra, risponsa and the question.  It watches al' sheet ventiterzo:  you darrÃƒÂ¡ the machina in order to use your nature to end the job del' universe.  Then, six you it woman nel' man, the man in the woman.

                            Not quite a law, but a very common thing in games...<br><br><b>Nostalgia</b><br><br>Magic used to be much stronger and more common than it is today. The magic we use is a pale shadow of that which our ancestors used.                        </br></br></br></br></div>
