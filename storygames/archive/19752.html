The players take on the role of some sort of angels of death that are responsible for culling the population. It seems interesting but I haven't heard like anything about it. Has anyone played it or could give me some more information on it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
