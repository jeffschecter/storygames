Point at someone and yell: YOU ROCK! Embarrass them.<br/><br/>I'll start:<br/><br/><b>Joe McDonald:</b> You are an amazing player! Your energy, flair, and creativity are a joy to behold. Also, sometimes you are so moved that you do a strip tease. Aside from being both awesome and alarming, this wild abandon is infectious and kicks everyone out of their safe little comfort zones.<br/><br/><b>Remi Treuer:</b> You rock so hard. I once saw you stand at the game table and command a river to do your bidding and if I had been a river right then I would have fucking jumped to it. Also, if there is ever a statue commemorating neck-stabbing, it better be of you.<br/><br/><b>Wilhelm Fitzpatrick:</b> You bring the heat every time. Your characters are always really cool and you have the gift of banter like no one else I've played with. You also bring rules mastery to the table which helps the game flow and keeps everyone on track and using the system to its fullest.<br/><br/><b>Lukas Myhan:</b> I've only played with you once, in a quick little IAWA demo thing. The way you embodied your character in a heartbeat and dove into a new game with so much style and intensity... it was great. I learned some techniques watching you, like how sometimes being quiet "in character" is a powerful thing. I hope we get to play together more often.<br/><br/>I have so many more.

You really have a flair for twisting things <i>just so</i>, to make our games even more fun than I thought they could be. I haven't been playing with you for long, but you've dived into the Indie Games I blather about with aplomb, and I'm grateful for that.<br/><br/><b>Per Fischer:</b> Per, you're a thoughtful, considered player that is always a joy to game with. You're the player I know from whom thoughtful silences are most anticipated and a cause for celebration, because I know when next you open your mouth it will be to suggest something that knocks me on my ass, in the best kind of way. No one plays an antagonist like you do, with subtlety and insight to spare.<br/><br/><b>Joe Murphy:</b> Your ideas about play and rules and such sync with mine in a way that makes me joyful. You're brilliant to play off of and build ideas in a game with, and your ideas are always solid and exciting. In play you regularly blow me away with great material and a considered response to the suggestions of other players. You play as part of the group and integrate everyone's ideas, therefore facilitating the awesome.<br/><br/><b>Graeme Ross:</b> I've never, ever met a player with as much energy, enthusiasm, and investment in his characters and stories. Seriously, people say that I'm enthusiastic, but it's a joke when compared to you. Your voices and accents are hilariously bad, but you keep it up, and it wins everyone over. I have the honour of having introduced you to RPGs, something that the hobby will eventually thank me for, I reckon.<br/><br/><b>Louise Hipwell:</b> You have great tolerance for my long, rambling, discussions about games. You're a great player, far better than you give yourself credit for. You're supportive and excited about my game. You have sex with me.

Nobody could possibly have more enthusiasm for play. <br/>\n<br/>\nJason Morningstar<br/>\nFor an intensely spooky sense of characterization, and intensity of delivery. <br/>\n<br/>\nJudd Karlman<br/>\nFun, quirky play that engages straight from his gregarious personality. <br/>\n<br/>\nShreyas Sampat<br/>\nFor an ability to make play feel truely mythopoetic, and yet very human, all at the same time. <br/>\n<br/>\nEmily Care<br/>\nFor empathy in play, and empathic projection.

You validated all of my design goals, broke the game, and thoroughly rocked me. Nick Smith walked into someone else's scene, and that broke the isolation.

'Cause, you know, they're still flippin' awesome players. In alphabetical order:<br/><br/><b>Angela Andersson</b>, my wife, who has moved from not-particularly-giving-but-a-literary-masterpiece 80x25 character MUSH poses about how her dark lace dress feature the tiniest patch of mold and the particular olfactory qualities thereof, to incredibly dynamic characters like <a href="http://www.hammergames.org/modules/mediawiki/index.php/Spirit_of_the_Century:_Character_GreasyGene" rel="nofollow">Greasy Gene/Jean</a>, the androgynous circus-escapee con-person who mid-session decided to "dabble in human trafficking" and ended up selling my character into prostitution after having eaten her eyeball. Any game - and gamer - would be lucky to have you, and I count my blessings daily.<br/><br/><b>Piers Brown</b>, I've only played with you a handful of times, but your presence has drastically upped the quality of the game each and every time. You have an uncanny ability both to offer awesome suggestions and to back down gracefully when they are not taken. I wish every player was as attentive and enthusiastic when it's not "their turn".<br/><br/><b>Justin Folkerts</b>, who manages both exceptional characterizations and a fantastic willingness to reflect on what makes games tick. I rarely meet players who do either as well as you, much less <i>both</i>! One word for you guys: <a href="http://www.hammergames.org/modules/mediawiki/index.php/Spirit_of_the_Planes:_Character_Oaf" rel="nofollow">Oaf</a>, the tree-wielding math-genius pacifist ogre.<br/><br/>Last but not least, <b>Hans Messersmith</b>, whose willingness to get together and experiment with all manners of weird hippie games has forever changed my game. The energy you bring to the table super-charges every session, and I'd sooner put the kids back to bed and tell my neighbours to move out than ask you to lower the volume of your laugh.<br/><br/>Dudes, you rock.

I need to gush about some extraordinary players who are outside my regular circle!<br/><br/><b>Jackson Tegu</b>, of course, is everybody's secret Kiss Dude and also seems to be living the kind of life most of us are content to experience through fiction.  But he's also the single most talented player I've met at noticing the clever thing you did, laughing uproariously about it, snapping his fingers in acclaim and <i>then</i> contributing a twist that makes things even better.  What's more, he commits to characters with a fearlessness that I'd compare favorably to most professional actors.<br/><br/><b>Joe McDonald</b> doesn't get an entry because everybody already jizzed on him.<br/><br/>On a classier note, I've been privileged to get to know and game with <b>Lukas Myhan</b> and <b>Lesley McKeever</b> on three occasions over the last year.  They bring very different things to the table:  Lukas has a considered, deadpan sense of humor from which he can flip seamlessly into serious story contributions, while Lesley has a knack for building and inhabiting characters who mix badassery with vulnerability in a way you don't often see in one-shot games.<br/><br/><b>John Aegard</b> and <b>Chris Bennett</b> get paired up because they both seem able to reel off coherent, believable, startling narration after only a moment's thought.  It's like watching a bar fight turn into choreographed kung fu.  I'm struggling not to lump <b>Matthew Klein</b> in with Chris, since I can't seem to find a game with one and not the other, but actually his talent is something different:  sure, he can stream consciousness with the best of them, but Matthew really excels at taking whatever nasty twist you came up with and making it <i>much, much worse.</i><br/><br/>Between my stint in North Carolina and moving to the northwest in the last couple years, I've been privileged to play with a lot of excellent people, but these kids have shined so much in our brief encounters that I have to award them MVP status.

The idea of playing your own profession tongue-in-cheek like that is really cool, and I also imagine it to be tricky. So, you're the first person who has played a character which made me want to learn more about the player. By the end of that, I wanted to know where Marcus Locke ended and Philip LaRose began.<br/><br/><b>Daniel Wood</b><br/>I don't think we played together once at GPNW09. Weird.<br/>Daniel has the ability to capture everything going on in the game in this single, understated, crystalline moment. It just... causes everything to implode. Silently. Softly. Almost tragically.<br/><br/>The best example of this is the first game I ever played of Ribbon Drive. Beautiful and talented, but somehow always distant Pauline (played by Daniel) is listening to her younger brother talk about Aunt Margaret. The brother mentions Aunt Margaret's abortion to my character, then adds "but everyone else here already knew that." Daniel just goes silent for a moment. "I didn't."<br/>Maybe it doesn't sound like much out-of-context (perhaps the brilliance of Daniel's art is just that), but it floored me and suddenly re-focused the entire game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215836/#Comment_215836" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T14:56:27+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  2:56PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Jeremy Lahnum</b>.

Our table is composed of the nicest, lowest-maintenance bunch of guys you'll ever find.  There's this easy vibe where we've all been around the block, we all know where the fun is, and we instinctively ignore the antifun.  But at the same time, we aren't hobbled by weird gamer conservatism and one-true-wayism.  We remain open to new paradigms and can adopt whatever crazy new indie weirdness comes through the door. We've played everything from M&amp;M to IAWA to WFRP to Beast Hunters to Contenders to Mouse Guard to the BSG boardgame.<br/><br/>When I'm DMing for them, I am continually amazed by the trust they extend in allowing me to lead them through a story.  When I'm playing alongside them, our characters are like family. We slip into a comfortably dysfunctional mess of weird little ambitions.  Our characters tease each other over pantslessness and bad dating choices, pausing just long enough to save the world.  Our games are like little Farscapes.<br/><br/>Our lineup is like this:<br/><br/><b>Mike</b>, who Wilhelm introduced above, is a fullback of a gamer, a big-hearted straightforward trouble-seeking missile.  Mike chomps on adventure hooks with crocodile fury.  Mike is awesome.<br/><br/><b>Kristian</b> is a born MG patrol leader.  He doesn't strut despotically like a Captain Kirk, but when fun requires that he make a decision, he snaps it out.  On multiple occasions last week, our patrol was about to descend into baby-birdism, but like a patient border collie, Kristian kept us moving forward.  And when Kristian throws off the mantle of respectability and decides to make trouble, it is always interesting trouble.  Kristian adopts baby owlbears, cuts deals with Orcus, experiments on freshmen, and assassinates mustaches.  Kristian is awesome.<br/><br/><b>Seth</b> usually has some larger personal goal that he's hustling towards, whether he's building a mercenary company or a thieves' guild.  He's the easiest guy in the world to plan adventures for.  The word 'Seth' really ought to be a verb -- at our table, I don't think that we flag, I think that we Seth.  Seth is awesome.  <br/><br/><b>Jon</b> (emeritus) is like a buddy movie actor.  He plays the kind of characters you can always go out and have a good time with.  If someone's marked for death, it's even better.    Jon is awesome.  Alas, Jon had to move away.  We miss you, man.  Come home already, away from the profane gods and false practices of California. <br/><br/><b>Dylan</b> is brand-new (to me) and it's like he's always been here.  He gets our thing and contributes his own blitzkrieg damn-the-torpedos thing.   I was anxious about adding a sixth to our table, wanting to have the extra absence resilience but worried about destabilizing our zen.  Those anxieties are silly.  Dylan is awesome.<br/><br/>And, of course, we have <b>Wilhelm</b>.  Wil has many gamer virtues, but chief among them is a sublime touch with characterization.  Wilhelm authors little moments of humanity; quiet devotion to one's god; quiet patronage to one's hirelings; quiet despair at one's idiot servants.  And when he busts out the glee, as he did when he brought his WFRP familiar Rahumel online ... it is shocking dog-meowing-sunset-in-the-east madness.  Wil is awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215920/#Comment_215920" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T00:47:03+00:00" title="July  2, 2009 12:47AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks for reviving this thread, Brendan. <br/><br/>i'll add a few and add to a few,<br/><br/><b>Daniel Wood</b> ran a game of DRYH for myself and others which redefined my idea of running games for people. He looked at my sheet, saw what i'd written, saw what i was excited about, saw why i was excited about it, then saw what i didn't want to be changed and what was up for twisting. Then he twisted all of that, without giving me the impression for a <i>second</i> that it was about anything but what i wanted. And he had me doing all the legwork, bouncing me between narrating for two different characters. It was wonderful. Afterwards i felt as if i'd been given a gift; the icing (on the gift) was that he enjoyed himself, too. We didn't even finish the game! But, wow, it was so great. I look forward to playing with him whenever we're within a stone's throw. I mean, plus his portrayal of Pauline, etc, etc. So gamazing.<br/><br/><b>Andy Henderson</b>, on the subject of good GMs, is one of those. A good GM. He does this awesome double-back thing, like we'll all be at the table and he'll be like, ok, hi. and we'll be like, hi. is this a game here? and he'll be like, yes absolutely. and we'll be like, what's going on in it? and he'll be like, what are your characters doing? and we'll get all wound up just bouncing off each other and making up shit and then suddenly all that shit we were making up is suddenly a plot and we're really fighting a witch and he already statted her up, but like when did that happen? David just made her up a few minutes ago. Now the giant statue that was table dressing is jumping up out of the ruins to fight us. we saw it a second ago but we didn't suspect anything, <i>which is the weird thing.</i> Because, like, giant statue of evil buddha is OBVIOUSLY gonna attack you, right? except king of casual description and spastic reaction, Andy is behind the wheel. and he'll be all like, guys, there is no wheel. But there is too, we can see it right there, you big liar! just because we can't see the strings doesn't mean you're not making us dance! and making us love it!<br/><br/><b>Christian Griffen</b> dude is amazing. If i stand up at the table more than once or twice in a session, it's because christian's at the table. and chances are those extra times are because i can't describe the cool flip or double handed overhead attack my character is doing without half acting it out. I have a powerful battery. Christian is made out of electricity. It's true.<br/><br/><b>Michael Pearsson</b>, sorry if i don't know how to spell your name. I love playing with you, you always come up with the awesome thing that i wouldn't; we're on wildly different wavelengths (you know, sometimes) but as soon as you say it, whatever it is that you're adding to the story, it just makes so much sense and couldn't be any other way. You just nail it! every time, you kick the scene harder and make it work better. turn it over, show me new sides. I love playing with you.<br/><br/><b>Willem</b>, you crotchety old maniac. You're never too proud for the low status role, and you bring respect to every role that i've seen you in. You do justice to the people you pretend to be, and that's not a usual thing. Aside from being such a pleasure to play with b/c you understand the dynamics of the players around the table so well and where the game can fall apart in the social sphere, you bring the radicallity within the fiction, too. Yeah, man. let's do more.<br/><br/><br/>and a thousand others, of course. but hell, it's late, and i don't wanna grab up all the good folks to describe.

He likes his anonymity. I have to say, it's like having a backup gamemaster with him around. Got somebody who looks a little left out? Given enough leash he'll build entire scenes, entertain a group for an hour or two in a way that gets them all active, and leave the plot completely intact when it's all done. In a larp, where the gm can never pay attention to everyone all the time, this can be a gamesaver. He's also really good at pointing out abusive players (as in players who abuse others, not characters who are abusive) and the mindgames they tend to play.<br/><br/>Because taking care of the players is more important than taking care of the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216837/#Comment_216837" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T05:24:21+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  5:24AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2009 5:25AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Shael Riley</b>. He enthusiastically plays the weirdest, quirkiest, and most interesting characters in a game. In structured games with assumed party dynamics, this doesn't work out, but put him in a game where he's free to take more narrative control and he takes off. He's also eager to push the envelope with character ideas, and he's one of the only people I really play "I will not abandon you"  style with. One of my favorite characters of his was a Sons of Ether from a Mage game who wore gloves, ate only white bread and drank only water, and brought the dead back to life.

Viking.  King.  Evar.  So you do Sci-Fi Noir and you do Shakespeare too?  What the hell?  NOT FAIR!  Your descriptions put me right in our session's game world.  But what should I expect from someone who sits down to a Nordic blood opera wearing a frackin' Mj\u01ebllnir necklace?  I'm bringing some Portlanders down to Eugene this summer so we can rock out some more.<br/><br/><b>Jackson Tegu</b>  I finally got to play with you!  I love your focused intensity.  It's like you come to the table, listen, and then get to work.  The choices you make seem to be built upon the urge to make others awesome.  I love that.  I wish our LitToS session could have been longer; I can tell that you were laying some groundwork that would be even more richly rewarded.  I envy people who get to play multiple sessions with you.<br/><br/><b>johnzo </b>  I finally got to play with you too!  You're like a tsunami machine of off-the-cuff mad character quotables.  You're like my uber-talented improv teacher from a few years back.  <i>I hate that guy!</i>  And you've received enough love (all justified, dammit) in this thread I've necro'd.<br/><br/><b>Eric J. Boyd</b>  The icy fanaticism of your Cecille from Montsegur last year still gives me the shivers.  And then you rocked the first Robot Daredevil I'd seen to date with THRX-99 in Danger Patrol.

I'm dropping a gaming slot next year to talk more with people like you.<br/><br/><b>Matthew Sullivan-Barrett</b>  I wish we could game together all the time!  I loathed stealing your Simon Sweetwater character's coin collection; you made him a real and sympathetic (in Fiasco terms) character in a den of harpies, thieves, and low-lifes.    You have great instincts.  Trust them more.  You're great at setting others up to shine as well.  Plus, you are a Matthew.<br/><br/><b>Ping</b>  You don't have enough love in in this thread!  That is just totally fucking <i>wrong!</i>  I was super happy to find out I was going to be rocking Harper's Apocalypse World with you.  Perfect comedic timing made your "I got shot!" quote my favorite of the weekend.  Plus, you are a relentlessly awesome organizer!  The dramatic talents of the flakes, punks and slackers in this hobby would wither on the vine w/o people like you!  Thank you for pushing me to run a second session of LitToS in my final session when I was being a weenie.  I had a great game with Ben, Dale, and Michael.  You are a catalyst of fun!<br/><br/><b>My regular posse in Portland.</b> You guys all rock.  You know who you are.  I look forward to growing old (even older) pretending with all of you.
