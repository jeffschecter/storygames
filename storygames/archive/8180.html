While this was by no means unique to France, the ties between significant politcal and industrial figures ran very, very deep. Various re-armament programmes such as the disastrous ARL-44 tank were dogged by this kind of thing. So, there are plenty of real-life machinations to translate into Cold City terms.<br/><br/>Oh, and what about France making use of German technology? Not just the weird stuff from CC, but, for example, a regiment of the Army was still using captured Panther tanks right up to 1950. Maybe there is something in stuff like that? Maybe France could be the nation that is most open about its use of the captured technology and must do things to avoid the anger of its allies?<br/><br/>And as Alexandre mentioned, there is Indochina. It might be a long way away from Berlin, but the situation in Indochina was huge for France. The quest for international co-operation in order to re-assert their status as a colonial power could be really big. Interest factet: during the disaster as Dien Bien Phu in 1954, no less a figure than John Foster Dulles suggested that the US might 'lend' France an atom bomb to save the situation. In the world of Cold City, what other technologies might get used? Are there things in Berlin that could be of use in Indochina?<br/><br/>Just a few thoughts. I'll try to offer something more detailed and coherent in the near future. I hope that we can get some insight from folks with a more in-depth knowledge of modern French history as well.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180119/#Comment_180119" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T15:52:53+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  3:52PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I understand that some ancient shermans were still being used years later when folks were afraid that paras from Algeria were about to land on Paris.<br/><br/>Conspirac-o-rizing some real events:<br/>What was in Paris that was so vitally important for Choltiz to destroy?

They grabbed a minimum of 25% of the parliament's seats between 1947 and 1956 while they were competing with a quite strong socialist party too. PCF was really in plain admiration for everything from the Soviet and remained loyal to Stalin even after his death. <br/><br/>An interesting angle about the Resistance is how some of them who suffered political police oppression under the Gestapo didn't cringe at using similar methods after the Nazis went down. It baffles me how someone could inflict torture on freedom fighters (like Algerian independence fighters) when they were persecuted the very same way for the very same reasons...

Good way to play up the nationalistic issues as well!<br/><br/>And possibly flash-forwards, too. I believe you'd mentioned having seen <i>The Battle of Algiers</i> the other day.<br/><br/>Apparently there are Vichy propaganda films up on Youtube now, too.

That was in the middle of XXth the key for economy ( factories and steel). And  as you know, the most important fields are in the Ruhr. So, in order to control it, the first attempt of the french government was to create a separate state from germany in the occupied Ruhr. It clearly failed after a referendum, when they asked it to the local population. <br/><br/>From them, Jean Monnet imagined a new proposal : make a separation between questions of territories and resources. Than mean creating a franco-german community of coal resources, based on equal treatment. this was the definitive solution.<br/><br/>I think it was a time of confusion and fears.
