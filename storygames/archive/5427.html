I asked Simon for a copy and he, very kindly, sent me a PDF, with obvious instructions not to pass it on.<br/><br/>Problem was, it was 250 pages long. It'd cost a fortune to print. It was cheaper, in fact, to upload it to Lulu and print it. So that's what I did.<br/><br/>Now...here's the thing. Simon didn't send me the cover. The cover, by Jerome Huguenin, looks like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.dyingearth.com/gumshoe/images/Trail%20cover.png"/><br/><br/>It's beautiful. But I didn't have it. So, making the best of it, I drew an approximation of Jerome's cover. I uploaded it to Lulu and used that as the cover.<br/><br/>So, when my copy arrived this morning, it looked like this. I think you'll agree I've captured the dark, brooding horror of the original.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/tocfront.jpg"/><br/><br/>On the back, I made sure to credit Simon, and squeezed in a subtle advert for my book:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/tocback.jpg"/><br/><br/>I flicked through the book on the train. Now, I must admit to some bias here: we're in the same game group. Still, I'm being honest, and it's not like he pays me money for saying nice things.<br/><br/>This book looks really good. The explanation of the Gumshoe system is the best one yet. See, in Fear Itself, I thought the explanation of scenario design was pretty poor: it made the game look railroady. Here, it's clever, and explains exactly what the system can do.<br/><br/>The background's great, too. There's loads of Mythos stuff. Now, I like Lovecraft, but not the idea of a "Mythos": for me, when you formalise it into a Mythos, you take away the idea of unknowable terror. ("Oh, yeah, that'll be Nodens, then"). <br/><br/>But this is superbly done. It's got alternative, contradictory explanations for things: Azathoth is described in the conventional "idiot god" sense; as nuclear chaos beyond angled space; as a term meaning "primal evil too horrible for description"; and as a deception. It's great. I'm reading it and enjoying it.<br/><br/>And there are really nice touches in the rules. They sound stupid if I say them (Credit Ratings, the Big Reveal), but they really are very good.<br/><br/>So tonight's job is sitting here, with a glass of wine, reading through. I have steak, too.<br/><br/>Oh, as a courtesy: you can get Trail of Cthulhu, albeit without my updated cover, from <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16474&amp;cat=287&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Indie Press Revolution</a> or <a href="http://www.profantasy.com/pelgrane/special.asp" rel="nofollow">Pelgrane Press</a>.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121700/#Comment_121700" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T11:05:15+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 11:05AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...hey Graham, did you notice your, um, recurrent typo in the title?<br/><br/>"Objection!

The way that the rules were explained seemed somewhat almost counterintuitive in some ways...I found myself skipping through the book to get a better feel for the game. Are you finding reading Trail to be like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm really exited about Trail being an old CoC - it was just about the only game I would play at conventions during high school and into college. I'm hoping that this is a good "inheritor" of the Chaosium legacy.

So everyone's got a Drive, the thing that drives them to investigate: academic interest, revenge, adventure. You've got Stability points as well as Sanity points (Sanity is how ignorant you are of the underlying pointlessness of the Universe; Stability is how well you're holding your shit together. You can be a devoted Cultist and appear calm).<br/><br/>So there's a big theme of what uncovering the Mythos <i>does to you</i>. Very Lovecraftian.<br/><br/>There's a wonderful rule called Anagnorisis, which describes the moment when you realise the underlying pointless <i>of your life</i> and go to pieces. It's connected with your Drive: you realise, at that moment, that your Drive is pointless. You wanted academic glory, but now everything thinks you're a nut; you were doing it for revenge, but you realise you're powerless; you were doing it for love, but the person you loved is a cultist. I'm excited by this: I love stories like Dagon and The Shadow Over Innsmouth, so the idea of playing out that "going to pieces" moment is great.<br/><br/>Gumshoe's big thing is that you spend points to discover clues, rather than rolling dice. I like this and find it takes the focus off the investigation <i>as an investigation</i>, moving the focus to a Simulationist-like "Let's explore this strange, horrific world". So, obviously, in Cthulhu, that's brilliant.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.

Whether it's worth picking up for Gumshoe alone, aside of the Cthulhu setting, is a hard call. There is lots of setting material.<br/><br/>The thirties part of the setting, with the depression, is pretty good. That'd stand up by itself. If you're into pulp, it's really very good.\n<blockquote>Can you have nice, big gunfights in which you blast a bunch of deep ones (or whatever)? Do they look like they will be fun to play out?</blockquote>\nIt has two playstyles: Purist and Pulp. Purist is Lovecraftian the-human-race-is-an-insignificant-speck. Pulp is nice big gunfights in which you blast a bunch of Deep Ones.<br/><br/>See, I like Purist, so I'm the wrong person to ask. And I don't really like the Gumshoe combat system, but the reason I don't like it is because I don't like combat in an investigation game.<br/><br/>That said, there's some lovely things in <i>this</i> combat system.

Not sure, though.<br/><br/>On the Lovecraft thing: I'm most excited about the Purist mode of play, which would let you do Lovecraft stories really well. Like, my favourite Lovecraft story is The Colour Out Of Space, closely followed by Dagon. I'm not sure CoC would do those well, but I think ToC would.<br/><br/>As for the anti-trad thing, it's difficult. In some ways, the game is very traditional: there are rules for using firearms from cover. (I was delighted to find rules for drowning and falling, too). It's definitely not a focussed indie game.<br/><br/>However, there's indie-like touches, like the Drives and the Stability system. There really are some lovely, quirky rules there. Like, for example, Fainting. If you narrate your character fainting, you reduce your SAN loss: but you give the GM permission to narrate what happens after you faint. It's cool.<br/><br/>That probably doesn't help you get off the fence.

There's nothing quite like putting on the soundtrack to Ravenous, Constantine, or even Riven (the computer game sequal to Myst) and reading something like The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, Call of Cthulhu, At the Mountains of Madness or The Case of Charles Dexter Ward.<br/><br/>Doing the Dream-Quest would probably best be handled by something completely not traditional.  At the Mountains of Madness, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, even Call of Cthulhu itself would probably be best handled in a traditional manner.<br/><br/>I should have expanded instead of just saying I'm in an anti-trad mode.  I'm really digging the remake games of old basic type D&amp;D right now.

Doesn't have to be ToC, any of the games will give you a feel for the Gumshoe System. If you enjoy the gaming experience, then it's just a question of setting and minor mechanics differences (ToC's use of Sanity, how Mutant City Blues uses stability, etc).<br/><br/>- Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
