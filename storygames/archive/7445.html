I have been a member of the GPA since 1997, and most of that time has been serving on the Board of Directors as the GPA's webmaster.<br/><br/>The GPA is a trade organization that exists to benefit its members and the gaming industry. We have two main benefits that we are known for:<br/><br/><b>1.) The GPA-L mailing list</b>. This is probably the main thing that many of our members rely on. Have a question about publishing your latest product? Wnat to know the best sources for game parts? Ask your question on the list and more than likely you'll end up with a number of answers from industry professionals. The information from this list could save you a lot of money.<br/><br/><b>2.) The GPA Booth Area.</b> Conventions are expensive. However, they are the best way to be seen by customers and the industry. The GPA purchases booth space at GTS, Origins, and GenCon. Then we sell it back to our members, usually at a lower price and a better position on the floor than they could achieve on their own.<br/><br/>We also have the GPA Showcase, where you can put your products on display without the need of your own booth. Volunteers would sell your product and keep track of sales. Its possible to sign up for the Showcase show-by-show, or take advantage of the GPA Gold Program.<br/><br/>The GPA Gold Program is a  service that allows members who wish to participate in convention showcases and co-ops to only pay for shipping once, to a single location, where their product will travel around the country, visiting six different conventions. We will keep an eye on inventory levels and send you after-con sales reports, so that you may send additional product should we run low on one or more of your titles. This allows us to pass on significant savings of both time and money to GPA members. <br/><br/>The following conventions are included in the 2008 Showcase Gold Program:<br/><br/>ConQuest Sacramento<br/>ConQuest Las Vegas<br/>Kublacon (CA)<br/>Origins Show (Columbus, OH)<br/>GenCon Indy<br/>PAX (Seattle, WA)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165494/#Comment_165494" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T18:52:25+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  6:52PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woot!<br/><br/>Uh, intelligent questions to follow at a later date.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165495/#Comment_165495" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T18:54:42+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  6:54PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's one:<br/><br/>What's the cost for these various services?<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165496/#Comment_165496" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T19:02:02+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  7:02PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thansk for bringing this here!<br/><br/>Here's another question and some more:<br/><br/>Can you contrast the services GPA offers with, say, The Forge?

If I wanted advice on how to get my book into Borders and B&amp;N, I would ask on the GPA list. If I wanted recommendations for tuckbox manufacturers for my new card game, I would ask on the GPA list. If I wanted someone to warn me about the pitfalls of using a Chinese printers, I would ask on the GPA list.<br/><br/>Now, if I wanted thoughts on how to market my small-press game, I would go to the Forge.<br/><br/>As for the Showcase, the Forge does not do this, so I am unclear what you are referring to. If you are talking about IPR, they are two different beasts. I don't recall the buy-in for the showcase, but it is something like $25. They do not take a percentage of sales. Generally speaking, you will be lucky to hit double digits in sales.

It's a pretty good place to get information about, and feedback on, these processes.  But it's definitely focused on DIY.  <br/><br/>At Gen Con (in the past; next year will be different), there's been a "Forge booth", logistically arranged by Adept Press, with a $<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">100 </span> $150 buy-in for first-time independent game designers.  Part of the mission is to support and promote new folks.  The second year buy-in is doubled, and then you are kicked out of the nest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165575/#Comment_165575" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T05:18:49+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  5:18AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, when you visited Blue Panther, it was actually part of a larger island.

But it's definitely focused on DIY.<br/></blockquote>\nJason,<br/>First, I am a member of the GPA and have participated in thier booth both as a showcase and as a 1/2 booth. When you buy a booth, it is really all you. When you get the showcase, it is nothing like the IPR booth. The showcase is very hard to sell out of and it is one of the reasons we went with another option this year.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between the Forge and the GPA to me is that the Forge is Indie and the GPA is small press. To me, that means the Small Tent vs the Big Tent. The GPA includes just about anyone including a few retailers and is very business focused. The Forge is design focused and rather exclusionary IME.<br/><br/>Hopefully that helps some.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165664/#Comment_165664" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T08:55:03+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  8:55AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Bill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165665/#Comment_165665" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T08:56:36+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  8:56AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2008 8:57AM by Grant Davis.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I heard that if you don't have a booth at GenCon, you aren't allowed to demo your own game anywhere in the convention center until after midnight.

They also don't want you camping out in the free gaming area and demoing it there.<br/><br/>If you were using the GPA showcase, then you could easily direct people to it for sales. You can also schedule demos and tournaments for the price of a GM or Exhibitors badge.<br/><br/>I've had some people follow me back to the booth after I had done a scheduled demo of Faeries Tale for Firefly Games. If you want to do some of your own selling you might also volunteer at the Showcase. But if you do, you want to be fair and help sell the other games too. Not just your own. We've had to smack one or two wrists in the past for steering people to their games only. It would also help you brush up on your "booth skills" without paying the full price of a booth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165836/#Comment_165836" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T18:45:26+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  6:45PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel M.

I hope that the GPA will be able to help you with your efforts.<br/><br/>That said, you have hit upon a weak spot that we have.. e-publishing. We really haven't been able to enact much in the way of benefits for kind of publishing because it tends to bypass many traditional marketing techniques. In the past, we have group-bought ads in magazines and shopping bags. Great for print material, but not so good for e-products. We would also need more e-publishers in the membership in order to come up with some useful group-buys.<br/><br/>The gaming industry is changing, people. We need to find ways to change with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165841/#Comment_165841" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T19:02:22+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  7:02PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2008 7:02PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Heraldic</cite><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>Keith, you mention that you serve as the webmaster- is there a reason you haven't posted the website address?</blockquote>Yes, because it simply didn't occur to me to do so.
