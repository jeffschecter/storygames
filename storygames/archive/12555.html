There's no cards with piles of contaminated bodies being piled up (deliberately, I think). You could just as easily play it as a game of abstract strategy and not be missing much. There's no personal engagement with the effects of a pandemic (which is great for what the game sets out to do, I wouldn't want it to).<br/><br/>I've kind of been thinking along the same lines, but I think it's my own brain malfunction: when I have a game concept I want to explore I always paint it using big plots and world wide conspiracies and stuff, it's hard to make a simple, quiet concept that still grabs people in a game.<br/><br/>Though, I guess the same could be said about movies. Wonderful old/indie/arthouse films aside, most modern movies (even the good ones) explore their concepts through big events and broad strokes. Toy Story 3 and Inception being recent examples: amazing films, but they deal with small, almost personal issues as if they're the end of the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281939/#Comment_281939" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T14:48:44+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  2:48PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pandemic examples aside, yes, I think that's a very clear distinction between how the priorities of many traditional RPGs differ from the priorities of many sorts of fiction.<br/><br/>I think it's very common in traditional roleplaying to atomize challenges, to break them up into very tiny parts and to reduce one's risk of failure to the point that the inherent tension of uncertainty is reduced or removed. Or to address challenges out of context with how those challenges arose. Line up your dice, tally up every possible bonus, fire away.<br/><br/>I also think it's very common in some forms of fiction to take relatively small things in the characters' lives and blow them up to the point where they're all-encompassing to the characters. But the author has total power over that -- it's his job to present the characters' urgencies and to make them important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282013/#Comment_282013" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T23:42:46+00:00" title="July 20, 2010 11:42PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of it is that the unit of most roleplaying experiences is the action - in other words, the player announces the action of the character.  Whereas in literature that focuses on more intimate life crises, although character action is significant, the inner life of the character is also both well-defined and well-expressed. Very few games require you to say what your character feels, or, to some degree, even think about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282103/#Comment_282103" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T10:23:26+00:00" title="July 21, 2010 10:23AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, for one, love small and quiet games with a focus on normal peoples' lives.

Maybe a concrete example:<br/><br/>A while ago I had an idea for some rules that would work great for playing robots who are struggling to be human. Thing is, I didn't know what these robots would really be doing while exploring their human side. My first instinct, probably from years of actiony games, was to make it some kind of big broad adventure thingy: maybe they're hunting down the last humans on Earth, or maybe their liberating enslaved machines, or whatever. Molehill of personal humanity to mountain of adventure.<br/><br/>Luckily, some very smart people pointed out that maybe it's just a game about simple people with simple dreams who happen to be liberated robots. So you're a robot, sure, you gained sentience while working in a factory, but now you're on your own, trying to achieve very human dreams. Maybe you want to get a job so you can move out of your apartment, whatever, but your struggling against your programmed nature. Molehill stays a molehill, I think, and it kind of works (I hope).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
