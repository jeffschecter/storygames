It is intended to be easy to pick up and play (as opposed to something like Dark Heresy 2e, for example, which is heavy and convoluted)<br/><br/>So in designing character options I have hit a wall. Initially I was to have 8 distinct classes with their own suite of mutually exclusive powers/abilities for players to choose from. However, tbh, plodding through 8 x 7+ powers (enough for a meaningufl choice) is tedious and difficult. <br/><br/>The only other way is to do what Qin: Warring States does: characters are not bound by class but each category of power (combat, alchemy, exorcism, divination etc) is open to any character. Unfortunately taking that approach means losing the essence of what makes each class (which comprises affiliation as well as ability) unique.<br/><br/>The classes are:<br/><br/>Alchemic Hero - standard martial arts class; kungfu by way of genetic modification/biomods.<br/>Ghost Constable - inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Fox_Killer" rel="nofollow">Ghost Fox Killer</a> from DC's Great Ten comic and the Amalgam universe Green Lantern. A corpse offered redemption to fight evil armed with a magic lantern. <br/>Wu Engineer - kungfu meets Rigger (ala Shadowrun). One who covets ancient tech.<br/>Dragon Shaman - pilots/explorers who manipulate hyperspatial power via cosmic Dragon Lines (leylines/geomancy).<br/>Wulin Mercenary - former noble warriors that represented the best of the 'old kingdom' who now sell their services for honour and coin. Sort of how John Woo would do Jedi in a post-Clone Wars universe.<br/><br/>As you can (hopefully) see a character like the Ghost Constable is not easily represented the Qin way: its powers aren't intended to be freely available. So that would make the character class, and the concept, difficult to incorporate.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439890/#Comment_439890" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T12:23:42+00:00" title="November  4, 2014 12:23PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose this class set-up is not central enough for your inspiration to revise the rules so that you <i>can</i> write the classes up separately? I mean that surely the difficulty is not in the classes per se, but in what the mechanical game requires of you in designing crunch for them. If this is the case, then streamlining the game would also make the classes less tedious and repetitive to write.<br/><br/>As examples to consider, note that both <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> (classical flavour) and <i>Heroquest</i> manage to have similar conceptually complex character classes, but their rules mechanics do not cause this complexity to translate into pages upon pages of redundant complexity.<br/><br/>Also, it is certainly possible that you just need to grit up and do whatever it takes, tedious or not; sometimes game design is boring. I'm myself currently developing a game with a somewhat similar design feature (~15 character classes with up to a dozen powers each), and I'm happy to do the work to get the game to shape up the way I want. Either I have more grit, my rules system makes writing up powers easier, or my subject matter is more interesting and therefore it's easier to think up fresh powers <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Finally, have you ever looked into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneSlayers" rel="nofollow">Runeslayers</a>? If not, then you totally should! It's a game that features many of the same design priorities you have, including a wide array of flavourful character classes with their own specialized powers. Despite this the game has light bones, and the design precepts behind the character classes are clear; perhaps you'd figure out a missing piece for your crunch-writing skillz by researching this excellent frontrunner for inspiration? I'm thinking of a specific feature here, but instead of talking about it, I'll just leave that link up there - the game is available for free, and it's possibly more educational to figure it out yourself.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439894/#Comment_439894" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T12:36:10+00:00" title="November  4, 2014 12:36PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not so much the rules that are the issue, but having to devise a whole bunch of separate abilities for each class. It's a chore! How many abilities are necessary how few is too few? Do prospective players want to beat themselves over the head with this stuff? I know as a read of SHRPG games, I never read the powers section until i create characters because i will never remember it all as an infodump.<br/><br/>Having a more flexible approach would make the game deeper but at the cost of the flavour of these classes - or some of them at least (I had ideas for a few more as well). Some of these are just ideas that don't mix with others: eg like being a Mega City Judge who's also a private detective for instance.

It's clearly a good idea to design your game so that you don't need to fall into this traditional rpg design pattern!<br/><br/>It occurs to me that <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> also features highly setting-specific character classes and special powers up and down the riverside. Unlike D&amp;D or Heroquest it makes this work by doing its damnedest to have the classes be <i>interesting</i>, with <i>interesting</i> powers. This causes the biggest superficial difference between a Whitewolf game and TSoY: where a trad game in WW style has every character class fill in all the "essential powers" for dungeoneering adventure even if that means making that power list about as exciting as a shopping list, the TSoY strategy is to merely recognize the half-dozen central issues of the character class and write up powers for <i>those</i>.<br/><br/>What this means in practical TSoY/SS crunch-whackery is that a Dragon Shaman or whatever might not in fact have any powers for moving faster, hitting harder, withstanding injury, and the other boring combat essentials that fill up the traditional rpg's spell/power lists. Instead, the game has a robust universal resolution mechanism for the "everyday stuff", so the class-specific things can be entirely focused on its own thing. This makes writing up classes in TSoY much lighter work, as you only need to think of what makes the class special and interesting, instead of having to try to invent eight different variations of "I hits hard, dur dur".<br/><br/>The other thing that TSoY does, now that I think about it, is repudiating game balance; because the designer is not responsible for ensuring that a Dragon Shaman and a Wulin Mercenary are equally strong in a theoretical arena fight, he can focus on making the geomantic magic system of the Dragon Shaman unique and flavourful. If it ends up weak, then tough titties - switch into a different class if power is what's important for your character!<br/><br/>(Everything I say about TSoY here also applies to FATE and Apocalypse World, by the way. There's been a certain trend of new-style powerz-list games evident over the last decade, and while those games feature classes and power lists like a trad game, there are subtle differences in strategy.)<br/><br/>Perhaps some of those design strategies might be applicable to your game as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439898/#Comment_439898" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T12:56:12+00:00" title="November  4, 2014 12:56PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I feel like commenting on the number of powers: historically we've seen that entirely exciting character classes can rest upon as few as 1-3 class features, provided that those features themselves are interesting to play.<br/><br/>For an example of this, last spring we played a sort of heavily modified D&amp;D campaign where one of the players played an Elf. This particular take on the game gives elves the ability to speak with animals, and as it happened, the player in question completely rocked the campaign front and backwards on the strengths of this sole ability; it's simply so versatile and interesting to play (being as how it causes roleplaying opportunities and generates information for the party). The player never felt the need to use actual spellcasting abilities, in fact - that's how powerful the animal communication skill proved to be!<br/><br/>Thus: if the class features are boring and thin (that is, they do not feature actual roleplaying game content, but rather merely cause math bonuses or such), you need many of them to provide an exciting class. If the features are varied and cause plenty of rpg interaction, you can get by with fewer of them.<br/><br/>Another example of this from my on-going design: one of the "classes" in my game is simply the "you've got a genie" superpower familiar from fairy tales and Justice Society comics. That's a single power, yet it is certainly varied and entertaining enough to not require anything to back it up. It needs a system for dealing with genie, but it doesn't need a powers <i>list</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439901/#Comment_439901" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T14:43:46+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  2:43PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh i fully agree lots of choices are not essential. <br/><br/>But I do like the idea of having an approach more akin to Qin, as I mentioned.<br/><br/>Or Legends of the Wulin.

It's that, as with martial arts and chi magic etc in traditional wuxia are things learned from a source, a master or member of some tradition. That's ultimately what these classes are. Some of these preclude other abilities and schools of knowledge. The point of the Ghost Constable is that it is a calling it consumes the individual. One cannot simply learn a bit of kungfu and a few Ghost Constable powers as well. At least I don't see how that would work without massively diluting the idea. The only way it could work is a character who comes across a Lantern, like Hal Jordan, and become a Constable by accident (the idea is/was that there are 108 of them and one is chosen by an elder).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439904/#Comment_439904" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T15:09:37+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  3:09PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I agree - some of those character classes are not that compatible. It depends heavily on the creative agenda of the game as to how much this class balance thing matters, and in what way.<br/><br/>For example, in modern D&amp;D class balance matters a great deal because players invest a lot in individual characters as emblematic representatives of their classes, and there's a lot of ham acting involved, as well as player self-identification as the type of person who plays a character of this class. All this means that players are sort of tied to their classes, and comparing their classes to those of other players - and ultimately, if the Wizard beats the pants off the Fighter in effectiveness, that becomes a Problem for the on-going game, as Bob the Fighter-player is not having fun when he feels like he's subservient  to Bill the Wizard-player.<br/><br/>This pattern is not the only possibility, though; in games where characters are more disposable, or conclusive class comparisons are actually a goal, the dynamics are very different when it comes to class balance. In the aforementioned TSoY for example it's a high point of the game when you discover that what do you know, Bill's Three-Corner Wizard proves futilely inefficient in comparison to Bob's Uptenbo wushu master. That's sort of why the campaign is being conducted, to find these things out. Play to playtest, sort of - what is perceived as a problem of imbalance in one game may be a clear virtue in another one.<br/><br/>This is a bit off the topic of writing powers in itself, but let's remember what I suggested above: one reason for why it's easier to write these long power lists for TSoY is that those powers don't need to be balanced in context to each other. The game does not assume that all power lists will be in play at once, and it does not assume some sort of arena combat conditions in which powers are being benchmarked in play. The end-outcome from the viewpoint of a writer is that we can focus on strictly one question: what is interesting about this character concept, and how would it be interesting to interact with it in play.<br/><br/>This might not be useful for your specific case, of course, in that you might already have all these same advantages and it's <i>still</i> too boring, or because your game is doing things that are incompatible with this type of repudiation of responsibility.<br/><br/>Still, developing the thought further: <i>Heroquest</i> is very much about balance, unlike TSoY, but it gets away with that by stripping away the game mechanics. There are still power lists, but they are extremely minimalistic - often just names of the powers. This still works because Heroquest is game of <i>discovery</i> like TSoY, except that it's not about discovering whether ninjas or pirates would win in a fight, but rather about discovering what it looks like when a ninja fights. That's why the game can get away with listing the martial artist's special attack as "Nine Lotus Touch" with no explication of what it does - the expectation is that the players will apply the rules and their own inspiration during play, and come up with the answer themselves. Nine Lotus Touch will be different in all campaigns (even if its efficacy will not be - Heroquest, as we know, is very strict about formalizing effectiveness).<br/><br/>Would it be an option for you to write up some or all of these classes in a hyper-minimalistic manner? This depends on how the rules system interfaces with the notion of special superpowers. Could you just tell the player that his character can do wuxia shit and let them come up with the particulars, perhaps aided with some simple guidelines to whatever extent that you feel like providing?<br/><br/>This simplistic question might be more important than it seems; I've myself found that often when I grow bored with "writing uphill", it's because I'm approaching the entire scheme wrong. Maybe I'm writing stuff that should properly be developed in play, instead? That would explain why I find it difficult and bothersome to do this writing in the abstract!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439909/#Comment_439909" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T16:31:39+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  4:31PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alchemics (kungfu, essentially) can be available to anyone by default, so that shouldn't be a problem.<br/><br/>Wu Engineering abilities (ostensibly known as Neitech - Neidanic Technology) can also be available.<br/><br/>(Caveats exist in each case.
