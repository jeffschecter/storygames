I mean, in a game like 4e, they can have different roles in all the important stuff (combat), but fictionally, I cannot place these two in distinct niches. Fighter, Thief, Wizard, Cleric: yes, distinct fictional archetypes. Fighter, Thief, Wizard, Paladin: yes, distinct fictional archetypes. But Cleric &amp; Paladin: no, not distinct fictional archetypes. Thinking about the Paladin confuses me on what a Cleric's supposed to be about, and thinking about the Cleric confuses me on what a Paladin's supposed to be about.<br/><br/>I'm interested in historical reasons why these both exist, but also in actual-play help. Like, if I play Dungeon World or something: What's the Cleric supposed to be that the Paladin isn't?

A proselytizer and converter.  She's more sagely and wise than her Paladin cousins.  She's able to fight, sure, because the world is a dangerous place.  That's a given.  She doesn't always get a friendly reception.  She casts spells to aid folks, to mend wounds and heal harm and communes with her god directly, in a way.  The Cleric is a tool of the Church as the holy organization upon which her god grants blessing.  She's not always about dogma and orders, though, sometimes you just do what you know in your heart that your god would want.<br/><br/>A Paladin is a gun.  A paladin is a sword or a bomb to wipe out evil.  They don't make nice - they don't bless marriages or births.  They spill blood.  They're designed to follow the codes of their order but those codes are about questing - about glory and blood and honour and yeah, there's a god behind them, but more often than not, there's a worldly order telling the Paladin what to do, as Interpreted by the Protocols of the Elders, right?  Most Paladins, by default, are a step removed from their god, in a way.  They have to earn the ability to commune directly.  It's just not as much a priority as honing their sword arms and crushing the unrighteous.<br/><br/>A fighter is just a dude or dudette who solves problems with weapons.  They fight for all kinds of reasons.  Maybe some goodly fighters would be indistinguishable from Paladins from the outside, but a Paladin never questions why he does a thing - it's for Law and for Order and for the righteous Light of their God.

I envision a moment in every adventurer who ends up on one of those three paths where they decide, internally or by some decree or whatever; "I am a Fighter / Paladin / Cleric" or how much would it suck if your Paladin was a failed Cleric or your Fighter always wished he could have been a Paladin instead?

They're almost identical conceptually, the only difference is that one is a little more fight-y and the other is considerably more cast-y.  The primary differences are mechanical.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Cleric shows up in OD&amp;D; supposedly because in early battles with the <i>Chainmail</i> war-game, a vampire named Sir Fang was accumulating an unstoppable undead army.  So somebody whipped up the Cleric as a way to neutralize large amounts of undead.  The Cleric is a fighty guy who casts spells, and (in OD&amp;D;) had a fighting ability curve halfway in-between the Fighting-Man and the Magic-User.  (Also, back in the earliest days, Clerics had spellbooks same as the Magic-User.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the Cleric at this point isn't necessarily a heal-bot: he or she is a Holy Warrior who beats the crap out of undead, and is also a compromise between the two extreme strategies of play.  To sweeten the deal, they also have a crazy-generous XP curve and can get castles for half-price, which to me suggests that even back in the very earliest days people had to be bribed into playing the Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy 1975's <i>Supplement I: Greyhawk</i>, Gygax introduces the Paladin as a kind of prestige class for Lawful Fighting-Men with 17 Charisma.  You get some minor healing powers, a warhorse, immunity to disease, etc., but it's pretty much a few minor situational glosses on the Fighting-Man.  Though the text sometimes refers to the Paladin as a separate class, as Jeff Rients points out it's probably best to think of it as a temporary gig because it's so easy to fall off the path.  (The Frank Mentzer BECMI version of the rules also treats the Paladin as a special career choice for Lawful Fighters who hit 9th level and don't want to become property owners.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1979 AD&amp;D; introduces the Paladin class as its own separate thing from the start.  And here's something interesting, or at least interesting to me as a D&amp;D; nerd:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AD&amp;D; Paladin is conceptually a <i>lot</i> like a Fighter/Cleric multi-class, except:<br/>\n* Only humans can be Paladins; only half-elves or half-orcs can be Fighter/Clerics<br/>\n* The Half-Elf hits level caps in Fighter/Cleric pretty quickly, whereas the Paladin has unlimited advancement<br/>\n* Paladins are extremely difficult to qualify for, whereas Fighter/Cleric is pretty easy<br/>\n* Paladins have a pretty strict moral code with lots of Lawful Goodness; Fighter/Clerics don't come with that baggage<br/>\n* Paladins are slightly more durable (due to save bonuses) and hit enemies slightly more often<br/>\n* Paladins also get fun situational bonuses, like the warhorse, the holy sword thing, and an aura of protection<br/>\n* But Fighter/Clerics gets full casting--until they slam into the level cap<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically if you want to play a Warrior type with a little bit of divine oomph, you're going to pick a Fighter/Cleric or a Paladin.  If you're thinking purely in terms of mechanics, the question is whether you want to play this guy long-term (i.e., longer than approximately 50,000 XP) and whether you see the Paladin's Code as more of an RP opportunity or a nuisance.  Otherwise the two classes are extremely competitive.  Assuming, of course, you qualify for Paladin to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically the Paladin = Fighter/Cleric, at least approximately.  It's either an extremely martial member of a holy crusading order, or a spiritually gifted fighter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363137/#Comment_363137" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T17:41:47+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  5:41PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Colin_Fredericks</cite><br>I assume you would have the same issue with the Wizard, Sorcerer, and Warlock?</br></blockquote>\nAhh, this thread is going too fast for me!

Y'know?</blockquote>\nFor me, it's like, Clerics are Holy Warriors and Paladins are Holy Terrors.  A Cleric is the person you turn to when you're hurt, you're cursed, you're scared for your life and you need someone who will protect you.  A Paladin is who you turn to when you are being ravaged by a demon or a vampire or something.  Just don't be surprised if they judge you, next.<br><br>Clerics are shields and Paladins are swords, ultimately.  Sure, the Cleric can deal some damage and the Paladin might Defend pretty regularly, but on a philosophical level, a Paladin is there to excise the badness from the world.<br><br>We left the two with a little bit of room around those philosophies so that players, in DW, can play around with the tropes.  Rather than say "All Paladins are X" like I'm doing in this thread, we said, by way of the mechanics, "many Paladins are X" and then let the players decide what kind of person their character is and what they do with their divine power.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363155/#Comment_363155" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T18:18:57+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  6:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite>I don't have much to add, except to say that a) I agree with Adam that class identification is fun, and b) I really enjoyed James' historical D&amp;D commentary.</blockquote>\nJames' post definitely deserves some kudos.

Never mind. I was a fanatical knight of Larani, who in Harn is something like the godess of feudal virtue. My character was Chandos the Unyielding, so known because he once lost almost his entire company defending a bridge from a raid by barbarians. The inside joke was that there was absolutely no need for the heroic defense. The raiders, had they crossed the bridge, could have come to a fortified manor house with its own defense force. The barbarians, having taken heavy losses at the bridge, would have been wiped out anyway. A good leader would have retreated from the bridge after putting up a good fight, but Chandos was, well, Unyielding. He'd give a beggar a gold piece one moment and backhand the crap out of a page who didn't bow to him the next. Larani has nothing against beggars but does not condone lack of respect. My favorite part of my character sheet was the notation showing that Chandos' Brawling skill was specialized in "Backhand." True Knights of Larani do not brawl, you see, but there's nothing wrong with an occasional touch of correction to a straying member of the flock.<br><br>One of the other players decided to play a member of the Holy Order, basically an inquisitor, and it took about thirty minutes of play for Chandos to become his permanent bad cop / attack dog, which relates nicely to what Paul said earlier. The Priests of Larani were the ones in charge of understanding her divine will and preaching. The Knights, who would have been Paladins if we were using D&amp;D rules, were the enforcers.<br/><br/>Admittedly in D&amp;D, paladins can start to pick up clerical powers as they level up (or so I recall, it's been a long time) but I still sense a subtle distinction between the idea of paladins as the chosen weapons of their god or goddess and fighter/cleric multiclasses as fighting men who preach on the side. If you don't think subtle class distinctions make sense, then the case for paladins vs multiclasses does surely look a little weak.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363527/#Comment_363527" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T15:20:27+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  3:20PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jlarke</cite>If you don't think subtle class distinctions make sense, then the case for paladins vs multiclasses does surely look a little weak.</blockquote>\nyeah, the case can be made for a nice subtle distinction, but in the very hard lines around D&amp;D's (traditionally) iconic niches, the Pally/Cleric divide is weird.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363699/#Comment_363699" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T00:27:45+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 12:27AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>In the source material, there are 12 paladins in the world, total.

More accurately, the paladins are the mythologized versions of Charlemagne's court, first appearing in French and Italian medieval romances some 300 years later. They are knights and nobles, vassals to Charlemagne and for the most part not members of a religious order or part of the religious hierarchy (the Archbishop Turpin being the notable exception). However, as the legends, the <i>Song of Roland</i> in particular, are often concerned with Charlemagne's fights against the Muslim Saracens of Spain, and as everyone was considered to be subject to the Church and the Pope, they still have a strong religious connection. (Note that in real life, the Pope crowned Charlemagne the "Emperor of the Romans" in AD 800.) And like their counterparts, the knights of King Arthur's Round Table, they tend to get drawn into holy quests. I'm not aware of those romances attributing particular divine powers to them like the paladins in AD&amp;D, however.<br/><br/>2) However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paladin_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Creative_origins" rel="nofollow">it is a known fact</a> that AD&amp;D's paladins are not quite directly inspired by the historical/legendary ones, but rather by their particular depiction in the modern fantasy novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Hearts_and_Three_Lions" rel="nofollow"><i>Three Hearts and Three Lions</i></a> by Poul Anderson. I've never read the novel myself, but apparently it involves the paladins of Charlemagne fighting against the magical threat of evil faeries; it may be that some of the more magical powers given to paladins in AD&amp;D are based more on Anderson's use of the legends.<br/><br/>As for clerics, they're meant to represent "crusading priests" of the Middle Ages, again with some inspiration from characters such as Archbishop Turpin, but definitely more on the side of divine ministers than knights/fighters of the ruling/aristocratic class. <br/><br/>My take on the difference: A paladin might go on quest for the Holy Grail, a paladin might lead the armies of the land against the infidels that threaten it, a paladin might serve as a shining example of all that the nobility (if not the common people) should strive to be, but only a cleric has the full authority and insight of a divine connection to the gods. A paladin's duty is to the realm as a whole, and to the rulers, but only incidentally through those to the people of the realm. But a cleric must deal directly with the people both as individuals and as the membership of the religion, leading them and caring for them and also bringing punishment down upon them if necessary. A cleric is a man of the people, and yet his divine ministry gives him authority even over paladins if necessary. That's all based on the medieval Christian European roots of paladins and clerics, of course; things may drift away from that in modern D&amp;D or in Dungeon World. And having said all that, I do very much like what Adam, James, and Nathan have had to say about the two classes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363701/#Comment_363701" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T00:39:27+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 12:39AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>My personal take is keep it simple.

Nonetheless, chapter 2 focuses on Sainte Foy as a reliquary enclosing the stolen skull of a martyr. Since the Second Council of Nicaea (787) stated that no church could be consecrated without the possession of a relic, <b>holy theft of relics (furta sacra) became a common practice in Middle Ages</b>. Taking into account this historical framework, it seems that in 882 the monks of Conques organized a secret theft of the relics of Sainte Foy, which at that time lay in a church in Agen, 75 miles southwest of Conques. They took the relics, carried them from Agen to Conques, wrote a chronicle about the furta sacra, and after some decades commissioned the first Sainte Foy statue to hold them. By contrast, the renewal or second stage of the sculpture was linked to Abbot Bernardus, who added imperial symbols (a crown and a throne) around the year 1000, so that Sainte Foy could be identified with the maiestas domini. </blockquote>\nAnd see this for a <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vXriQodlUsQC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage" rel="nofollow">story of the 10 years it took to steal the relic of Sainte Foy</a><a>.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363728/#Comment_363728" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T05:13:54+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  5:13AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jlarke</cite><br/>Admittedly in D&amp;D, paladins can start to pick up clerical powers as they level up (or so I recall, it's been a long time) but I still sense a subtle distinction between the idea of paladins as the chosen weapons of their god or goddess and fighter/cleric multiclasses as fighting men who preach on the side.
