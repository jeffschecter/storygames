Pretty simple. It's not like fantasy worlds are proofed for internal logic before publication.<br/><br/>Or, for a more detailed literary theory answer: fantasy stories are usually written with themes and aesthetics that might be termed romantic or even atavistic. The genre is a continuation of historical romance, and it's a deliberate throw-back and refusal to embrace modernism in art. For this reason fantasy worlds tend to harken back to a mythic past when men were real men, women were real women and monsters were real monsters. Breaking archetypes is a powerful tool in this context, and often fresh new takes in the genre are "fresh" because they simply refute genre assumptions and represent a woman as a warrior hero or whatever.<br/><br/>Looking at gender-switching in this light, it just might be <i>the</i> most fundamental part of human identity, and therefore a part that is almost impossible to mess with while simultaneously preserving and affirming the idyllic medieval reality of your average fantasy story. It's just not a very natural thing for people to write about when they're trying their hardest to work in what is essentially a lyrical form: the author is trying to impress upon you how beautiful the princess is or how brave the swordsman, so having weirdness like gender ambiguity mixed in there is just about the last thing in his mind. Occasionally it happens, but it's going to be massively transgressive: in traditional fantasy the hermafrodite will be a wizard or a witch, outside society and reproductive logic, very much an eldritch figure.<br/><br/>Nothing in particular prevents one from doing transhumanism (which this amounts to) in a fantasy milieu, but the author's going to feel the pressure of expectations there: fantasy literature is where you write about ideals of beauty, so it's possibly going to look like you're unhealthily interested in alternative sexuality as an author. Of course that's surmountable, but apparently audiences, creative needs and cultural trends haven't yet crossed to make this happen in any great numbers.<br/><br/>It might be indicative that the only fantasy novel that comes to mind at the moment that has significant trans-sexual content is Piers Anthony's <i>Pornucopia</i>, which is little more than an erotic picaresque itself.

And unlike, say SF, isn't really bound by any sort of rationalization, realism or justification.<br/><br/>Our Wizard just went from gender ambiguous to male-sexed only after he fucked his male human apprentice in a fit of elven estrus.

I can't say it's surprising that so few games even nod in its direction, let alone address it in an interesting, thoughtful way.<br/><br/>Now, if there were, say, entire sections of the bookstore devoted to romantic adventure novels that proceeded from a different, things might be different.  Imagine if Malory or Tolkien had hit it big by writing epics that drew heavily from Native American trickster stories instead, and all the subsequent imitators and imagination flowed in that direction as a result...the games based on that genre would almost certainly have a lot more sex-changing in them, because that's an enormous part of the source material.

I mean, elves and dwarves and orcs are bog-standard elements of fantasy games, so much so that it almost seems to me that there are actually fewer games with genuinely interesting and thoughtful approaches to elves than there are games that address gender/sexuality issues in interesting ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358810/#Comment_358810" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T20:19:28+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  8:19PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny you should mention that Ben.

Sure, there is a subset of experimenters who explore this sort of thing (and are probably overrepresented in this community), but for every high school drama club which had boys kissing boys, there was half a dozen where most of the kids were afraid to touch each other on the bus.<br/><br/>In the end, the niche for gender-bending in fantasy exists, but most producers of content in the area are better served by casting the wide net and putting food on the table and to do that you don't mess around with the insecurities of the larger audience.<br/><br/>That all said, fantasy has its roots in folk tales which are often related to dead mythologies, all of which contain historical contexts for gender and sexuality which have varied greatly over the course of just a few generations or a few hundred leagues, so even if they weren't controvercial at the time, in our context they can be eye-opening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358873/#Comment_358873" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T08:38:52+00:00" title="February 11, 2012  8:38AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            elegua,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're acting as if gender is super-fluid in every _other_ genre.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain:<br/>\n<br/>\nFantasy writers are conservative because most writers are conservative because most writers are hacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_358880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358880/#Comment_358880" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T09:51:37+00:00" title="February 11, 2012  9:51AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2012 9:52AM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with you, Zak.

Still, acknowledging that gender-bending is not a very common theme, is it really <i>equally</i> rare in the fantasy genre as it is in others?<br/><br/>We can at least name genres where gender-bending is much, much more common and acknowledged. They are clearly exceptions from the baseline to the other direction. This still leaves the question: considering that a fantasy milieu so naturally enables all sorts of wonky gender and sexual issues, how come it's no more popular than it is in mainstream literature? I can understand how mainstream literature doesn't tell more stories about people switching genders due to how a realistic depiction is tied down to real-world sexual minority issues, but a fantasy story doesn't have those limitations.<br/><br/>For genres with more gender-bending, consider cyberpunk/transhumanist scifi as mentioned above: as the entire genre almost revolves around body-identity, gender and sexuality are addressed constantly. For another example, consider manga - it's not just one genre, but an entire medium that seems much more gendertaining than western media; from adventure to comedy to romance, stories about boys who become girls and girls who become boys magically or socially or in the way of embarrassing clothes abound.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358886/#Comment_358886" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T10:08:45+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 10:08AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, also - roleplaying has quite a bit of gender-ful fantasy, at least compared to fantasy literature in general.

So naturally,as a percentage, it's gonna look way more genderbendy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTranshuman scifi has not become popular enough to be overrun by hacks yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for manga and anime--gender fluidity is huge in Japanese genre fiction largely because of different comic-reading demographics.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Japan, you can't make enough money to support a comic only selling to the half of the japanese-speaking  population that is male so those comics have ALWAYS been both-genders-targeted (or had both-genders-targeted material)<br/>\n<br/>\nLike how many times have you watched a Japanese movie that was an action flick and then suddenly there's out-of-nowhere Jane Austen in it? About a million. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the commercial requirements contribute to a more complex tradition. You actually see that in the culture of a lot of languages where the number of people who speak the language is limited compared to the US.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you;re writing in English, you can make millions just selling to like, say, "rock-climbing metrosexuals who eat alfalfa only on alternate wednesdays and like Tom Jones" because so many people speak it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358910/#Comment_358910" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T11:39:36+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 11:39AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2012 11:40AM by Johnstone.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think simply blaming it on hack writers is too simplistic. I've read fantasy novels by hacks that attempted to include some pretty insightful/progressive/challenging social commentary. I would say it probably has more to do with fantasy being comfort food, and not a genre dedicated to questioning social/technological norms like science fiction (and maybe Zak was getting at that in the first sentence of his last post).<br/><br/>On the other side, if we look at sci-fi, you'd be hard-pressed to call Asimov or Herbert hacks, but their work tends to represent a 1950s American view of gender. And a lot of other sci-fi is the same way, except that yes, there is this transhumanist genre in there, doing something different.<br/><br/>It's just that fantasy doesn't have its own transhumanist genre yet. Or if it does, and you put writers like China Mieville in there, it's much newer than sci-fi's and hasn't gotten much into the gender thing yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358911/#Comment_358911" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T11:46:01+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 11:46AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think most genre novels are hackwritten comfort food (only a hack would write "comfort food") and most nongenre novels are hackwritten comfort food.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsimov and Herbert are not _exactly_ hacks, but they are not James Joyce, Jack Vance, William Burroughs, or  M John Harrison either.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is: not shockingly good at the "writing" part of writing.

partially about "what do you think the future  will be like?" and most people do think the future will be more open about gender whether or they like it or not.                        </div>\n<div

future will be like?" I would say that mostly, fantasy is partially about "what do you think the past was like?" at least on a metaphorical or symbolic level. And most people would not say that the past was characterized by more fluid gender than the present. One might make the case that gender was less binary in this "past" compared to ~the English-speaking world 1850-1950 when the idea of fantasy as a market genre was being consolidated, but "less binary" and "more fluid" are not the same concept. when you combine that with the idea that, i would argue, "fantasy" tends to be more about ideas in a symbolic way than about the logical implications of a give idea, I don't think there's reason to be surprised that gender fluidity isn't a more pervasive theme in English-language fantasy writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you get gender change as something that may happen significantly - look at Tip's transformation back into Ozma in Marvelous Land of Oz, or mythical examples like Tiresias, who is male, then female, then male, and bears a prophetic daughter while female, and gains supernormal insight himself(herself) due to the consequences of this path of change. Orlando is the subject of a novel because he, she is unusual in his, her fluidity of gender.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, saying that gender fluidity would be the default way of thinking about gender suggests that polymorphism and  transformation depicted in that fantasy world is itself so pervasive compared to gender transition in the writer's culture that it would naturally follow that it would become the assumption - Is the experience of being transformed more central to most people's experience in that world that they define themselves as protean in regards to any aspect of change, not just gender? How much does King Arthur's change in social class lead to a sense of fluidity in class in the world he lives in? (In T.H. white, it leads to a lot of fluidity for arthur, less for characters around him - the study is a contrast, not change of context.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy all means, write and game fantasies that deal with these ideas. I don't think it's surprising that they aren't a default given that fantasy exists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_358926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358926/#Comment_358926" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T12:32:48+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 12:32PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2012 12:34PM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having wizards and witches propagating sex-change is a great idea, in my view. It would help diversify the way magic manifest itself in a fantasy setting. I love every tidbit that helps fantasy elements build curious ways of living, especially when such elements has their counterparts in our world (people going through sex-change).<br/><br/>I have an urban setting in my game Fabula, the old metropolis of <i>Januse</i>, with a lot of powerful (and not so powerful) wizards and witches. Having some of these organizing private ventures to cater for "needs" in a bewildered and diverse populace, is almost imperative to the setting.

I have a sense that as fantasy has become more influenced by Tolkein and his followers, it has become more conservative and less wild.

It's far easier to describe dragons and wizards and shit, than it is to think the fundamental transgression and temporality of deepest held mores and beliefs. A similar thing happens in SF, where things change (flying cars) but people don't (housewives on the moon). The habit of writers to project their own cultural practices into the imagined past, present and future is common-place. Being able to shake one's own baggage by committing to truly transgressive and imaginative work takes talent, courage and skill.<br/><br/>It's not that we're surprised but there is a certain irony in being able to easily imagine impossible things (wizards) but not imagine things that exist (transfolk).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358931/#Comment_358931" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T12:49:27+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 12:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, yes, everyone's right, Zak, Eero, Orlando, Johnstone, Cole, etc; also especially Gilbert: noogies to all who say otherwise. <br/>(I mean, Johnstone kind of re-iterated it with the comfort food thing, but whatev.)<br/><br/>&amp; mostly:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orlando Wilson</cite>Well Johnstone, looks like we have a novel to co-author.</blockquote>\n!!DO WANT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358932/#Comment_358932" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T12:50:39+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 12:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2012 12:52PM by jackson_tegu.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orlando Wilson</cite>The habit of writers to project their own cultural practices into the imagined past, present and future is common-place.</blockquote>\nUm, market capitalism in D&amp;D much?<br/><br/>Edit: but don't derail, please, this is just a side note.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358933/#Comment_358933" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T12:50:45+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 12:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's also this issue:<br/><br/>In order for a story to be accessible to readers, there need to be familiar baselines to which we can align our expectations.<br/><br/>Like, if you have transgressive gender identities, temporary and shifting sexes, groundbreaking thoughts on magic, newly invented races, fantastical new cultures, strange otherworld physics, bizarre cuisines prepared with invented ingredients, etc, etc, etc... (many) readers can't juggle all of those difficult moving parts at once. There's no familiarity with which to establish traction.<br/><br/>People need some familiarity. It builds a baseline and helps underscore why and how the unfamiliar is important. An author (especially a speculative fiction author) needs to provide some stable ground, even if only to subvert that stable ground later on.<br/><br/>The bummer is that conservative social relations &amp; gender roles are almost always part of that "familiar ground," and magic and invented cultures are almost always part of that "exciting unfamiliar."

What I find really compelling about how GRRM handles it, though, is that it isn't a free-wheeling, liberated fantasy world in which you can be whomever you wish. Rather, he presents a world in which gender norms are as oppressive and totalizing as our own, in which these characters' small acts of liberation and self-construction within strict boundaries take on a profound significance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359122/#Comment_359122" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T19:13:05+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  7:13PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orlando Wilson</cite>Oh man - I think it would look like Dhalgren and Heavy Metal underpinned by pornographic queer anarchisms, righteous post-colonial marxisms and heretical speculative materialisms.

Maybe I'm reading that wrong? Gender is inherently human. Although I'm sure there's papers out there that will argue with me (yes, I know inhuman objects can be gendered) but it's definitely not the other way around. If you're human, you have a gender identity. Transhuman would be the lack of gender, not the switching, bending, crossdressing, queer, or sexual preferences that human beings in the real world are a part of every day. Ok, go ahead and argue the semantics of that one with me.<br/><br/>Gender is TOTALLY IMPORTANT IN EVERYTHING (well, to me, but I would argue to everyone, as we all have genders). How authors dictate gender roles in 20th century fantasy is super indicative of the time they live in, and how they perceive the past, not how the past actually was and how gender roles were actually performed. To assume that gender norms we hold to now that we've pretty much had since the Victorian era is the same for everyone for all time is absurd. There's actually a whole lot of mystery surrounding gender roles in medieval times, as I've heard academics say to me, and a lot of misinformation in the history books due to the biases of the historians writing them. <br/><br/>Applying transsexual/crossdressing roles to witches and shaman is exactly how tribal cultures have been doing it forever. Nothing crazy there.<br/><br/>Hm, what else.<br/><br/>I think we see more genderbending stuff in sci-fi because it's often meant to function as social commentary. Fantasy as a genre doesn't function as a social commentary, it is based on mythical worlds. But, I totally agree with everyone in this thread that was talking about mythology and how it has genderbending stuff in it all the time... so where does the disconnect happen? <br/><br/>I'm not an academic, so I don't know much the truth of this. But, I would point to the larger gender role issues in the western world today as the culprit. It always comes back to this for me, sadly. I often find myself making gender points about women, queer folk, and people on the edge, because often it's just not considered, and in the US we do still have this story of gender roles that we've had since the turn of the century. Despite that fact, I would argue that gender issues are super popular right now. If you want to see some really awesome gender stuff in pop-culture, watch Ru Paul's Drag Race, and I'm actually attending a tech conference tomorrow that features Dan Savage as a keynote speaker regarding It Gets Better. Maybe sometime soon Fantasy will start diving more into that realm, simply for the shift in thought that's occurring in the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359287/#Comment_359287" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T09:52:12+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  9:52AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite><a href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">@anansigirl</a><br/>Well if you want <b>gender-swapped</b> comic book super heroes then you should know that wish is pretty much continuously fulfilled in that particular medium/genre:)</blockquote>\nHm...

But I would love to have someone include them. To cite Distress, below, you might have a fantasy world where there is only one human race, but seven distinct genders (so Gender would be the new "Race").<br/><br/>In SF, I am a huge fan of the semi-autistic and almost certainly non-normative (homosexual? sexless?) Greg Egan. His novel <b>Distress</b> might be something to pull from. It's a suspense novel about a physics convention in 2055. But there's a lot on gender roles, and they introduce 5 new and distinct genders that came forth in the 50 years between now and then. It's been a while since I read it, I just remember that the other five were mostly altered, one was basically a sexless/androgynous gender (the main character has a relationship with one*), two were basically "super men/women", in that they basically altered themselves to essentially be the opposite of queer and to take on - deeply - all the chemical/physical effects of their born gender (elevated testosterone, hair etc for supermales; stuff like that).<br/><br/>You'd have to then set it in a world of fantasy with the power to change gender and the like (through magic? On purpose?), which IMO would be very interesting to pull off, and perhaps create a social landscape more alien than the physical landscape of Dark Sun, even if the altered genders are an extreme minority.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* While Egan can be dry at times, the depictions of that character (Akili Kuwale) are really quite well done. I was able to easily visualize the character, and... ...yeah, found ver to be more than a little hot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359290/#Comment_359290" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T09:58:37+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  9:58AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2012 10:00AM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @anansi<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you saying "I want comics where Catwoman (or a given female heroine) is a machiavellian badass and possesses positive traits traditionally associated with male heroes"?<br/>\nIf so, these exist and it comes up maybe more than one might expect.

Absolutely.)<br/><br/>Traditionally, people have said that the human body is a fixed thing, and the experience of living inside a specific body must also be a fixed thing. Transhumanism is about breaking down those assumptions - especially the former, but also the latter. Deconstructions of gender and the performance of entirely new genders is similarly about changing what it means to <i>live inside a specific body</i>.<br/><br/>If we're to witness gender fluidity in any genre, certainly we should witness it in transhuman fiction. When the human body is not longer a fixed thing (or even a relevant thing?), it follows that the experience of living inside a specific body would also carry radically different implications and meanings. Right? So this is a genre that by its very nature <i>ought</i> to have really interesting and weird things to say about sex, gender, performativity and subjectivity.<br/><br/>That said, we should also see more gender fluidity in other types of fiction. Because (a) it's hella interesting, and (b) it makes for awesome switcheroo-hijinx that are fun to read, and (c) it's a part of the human experience.

People can be sexualized in all sorts of different ways, but in a gender role-reversal then you're specifically looking for guys who are posed like women and vice-versa.

So, whenever I think of Transhumanism, I think of technology that makes it possible for us to become more than human. So I see you part way on this if we're talking fantasy (which we partially are in some of these posts, like, fantastical gender changing), and a man could turn into a woman physically. But, if we're just talking about <i>performing</i> gender, a man can perform as a woman with no physical change at all.

However, the actually terminology started in the 50's I think. The movement started in the 80's which is probably around where the fiction started.

long as you reliable performed you gender, legally speaking, your sex was irrelevant. There are a number of British court cases to this effect, of women becoming men legally by simply adopting masculine decorum. It's not until the rise of biological sciences in the public sphere did matters of sex start to be tied so rigorously to matters of gender.</blockquote>\nThis is fascinating! I don't suppose you can point me at any online information about specific cases, please? I'm aware of pirates, soldiers and sailor who were women accepted as men, but I hadn't heard of legal recognition of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359720/#Comment_359720" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T01:36:01+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  1:36AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>But, if we're just talking about<i>performing</i>gender, a man can perform as a woman with no physical change at all. Right?</blockquote>\nSure, absolutely!<br/><br/>But since (a) fluid gender performativity is complicated, and (b) writing complicated stuff is hard, and (c) a lot of folks don't get it... it's understandable that it doesn't show up more widely in most literature (assuming that it doesn't show up very widely in most literature, which I don't know if that's a true thing or not). But with transhumanism, writers are intentionally and specifically unpacking what it means to be a human and to break down traditional definitions of humanhood, gender fluidity becomes a thing that <i>ought</i> to be super prevalent. Partially because transhumanism's biological fluidity would provoke new thinking on gender, but more importantly because a genre that seeks to explore complicated ideas about body and self and transition simply can't do so effectively while holding to constructs like fixed gender binary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15799/why-is-gender-static-in-fantasy/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15799/why-is-gender-static-in-fantasy">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15799/why-is-gender-static-in-fantasy/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15799/why-is-gender-static-in-fantasy/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15799%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15799%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
