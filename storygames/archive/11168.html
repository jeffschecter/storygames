The goal is to collect victory points by expanding your civilization over the map. However, you've got a limited amount of tokens, so eventually the only way you can keep growing is to get a new one; your current civilization "goes into decline" and you get to pick a new one to play as. It's mechanically similar to Vinci, if you've played that.<br/><br/>The game mechanics don't reduce your board power as a punishment for falling behind. This is an important feature for me and some of my friends.<br/><br/>2-5 players. Games last about an hour, maybe an hour and a half. I'd say it's about as casual-play friendly as Settlers, if not more so (and I am definitely a casual board-game player).<br/><br/>Downsides:<br/>- It's not especially educational, if that matters (there is room to flex your creativity by making up new fantasy races or special abilities, though).<br/>- Not very resilient to losing pieces.<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248213/#Comment_248213" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T23:30:00+00:00" title="December 22, 2009 11:30PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really hard to answer without knowing what you like.  Here are what I consider my staples, given the folks with whom I generally play games:\n<ul>\n<li>Settlers of Catan, which you already have.</li>\n<li>Bohnanza - a card game of bean farming (no, really), with the constraint of working with your cards in the order they were given to you, and the opportunity to trade with fellow players to help with that constraint.</li>\n<li>Pandemic - a very accessible cooperative game which has the players combatting four separate contagions across the world, treating people to buy time until all four cures are found.</li>\n<li>Carcassonne - a game that asks players to place tiles in order to build the countryside around the region of Carcassonne, in France.  You place followers to score points.  It's possible to place followers such that you work together with others to score points, or if you prefer, such that you steal the efforts of the other players.</li>\n<li>Rage - A trick-taking card game where each hand players declare how many tricks they'll take, and then earn (or lose) points for succeeding (or failing).  It adds a fair amount of chaos by including cards which can change trump mid-trick, or eliminate trump altogether.</li>\n<li>Transamerica - a connection game where players try to connect a set of five cities with track before anyone else connects their five cities.  The catch is that if you build into someone else's track, you each can then share each other's track.  Eventually all track is usable by everyone.  It becomes a game of getting more help than you give.</li>\n</ul>\nOthers I like, and play often, but wouldn't consider the best options for someone new to such games, since they're either a bit more complex, or more tightly targetted to my tastes (though, most warnings about generalizations would apply):\n<ul>\n<li>Tichu - Card game for four players [b]only[/b], played in partnerships.  A climbing game where the object is to get rid of your cards, but with special cards, trading cards with the other players, interesting scoring rules, and options to predict your success for greater reward (but at greater risk).</li>\n<li>Mystery Rummy - Rummy-based card games themed to various mysteries or criminal situations.  They all have action cards that allow greater control of the cards you get, and some can be played in partnerships. There are four numbered versions in the series (Jack the Ripper, Murders in the Rue Morgue, Jekyll and Hyde, Al Capone and the Chicago Underworld) and two others that technically aren't in the series, but easily could be (Wyatt Earp, Bonnie &amp; Clyde).</li>\n<li>Arkham Horror - Big, sprawling dicefest of a cooperative game set in HP Lovecraft's Arkham, Massachusetts.</li>\n<li>Pow Wow - Basically Indian Poker:  everyone places a feather on their head.  You can see all feathers but your own.  Starting player declares the sum of all feathers (including their own).  Next player either challenges ("Your guess is too high!") or raises.  Lose three challenges and your out.  Last player standing wins.  Pow Wow adds specialty feathers (negative numbers, "x2", "Max=0", etc.) to spice things up. </li>\n<li>Snow Tails - players race dog sleds by playing cards to determine speed, braking, and "drift", which is how you make your sled turn.</li>\n<li>Pitchcar - another racing game, but this one is purely physical.  You set up a race course using tracks, and then flick little disks around the course.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248216/#Comment_248216" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T23:48:51+00:00" title="December 22, 2009 11:48PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brennan,<br/><br/>First, a link to my <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/GreatWolf" rel="nofollow">BoardGameGeek</a> profile. Check out my collection and feel free to ask questions about things that seem interesting. Also, you can find information on all the games being discussed here on that site.<br/><br/>Second, what's the amount of time you're wanting to spend on a game? For example, I'd recommend <i>Tigris and Euphrates</i> as being a great game, but it's a 90 minute game. A game like <i>Caylus</i> or <i>Agricola</i> will be more like three hours. Is that too long? How many players are you thinking you'll have? And so on....<br/><br/>Third, Jungle Speed.

You could buy expansions annually, too. :}<br/><br/><i>Dollar for dollar, though? Get five sets of matching Treehouse and go nuts.
