Quit the force? And then you watch it again, and you can see all the narrative techniques, and the film-making techniques that raise the tension here, which made you so concerned the first time, and you can still sorta feel that, even though you know what happens to the cop, because The Wire doesn't change.<br/><br/>You do?<br/><br/>Is there a proper name for it?

Most people don't cry at the Opera. The ones that do are the ones that know it very, very well. There is a tension between knowing how something should be done, hoping it will be done that way and, when it is done, releasing that tension. Boo hoo. I think some people call it emotional closure.\n<blockquote><br/>And then you re-watch it, or re-read it, and you already know what happens, but there's still that tension there, like you can feel the narrative tension, and you can't help but wonder what will happen, even though you already know what happens?</blockquote>\nThis is really interesting to me. I think that there are two things going on here. The first is surprise and the second is tension. I think that most blockbuster horror films endorse the former. That is, when you watch them again, the films aren't very scary. That's what Baudrillard might have called a pornographic narrative. Everything is exposed. The twists and thrills are cheap, fast and forgettable.<br/><br/>What you're talking about, my ideal story, looks to me like a mixture of surprise and tension. The writer foreshadows the inevitable, giving tension, and peppers it with surprise. The suspense builds from the knowing, anticipating and rendering of some expectation. The added surprises of the film might actually be incidental, or might be used to slosh against the audience's safety nets, exposing them a little for some dramatic purpose. Like, I know what happens in Fight Club, but every time I watch it I get anxious. Knowing the story has become irrelevant (as a surprise) and, at the same time, more relevant (as an anticipation). Like an Opera, the more I watch it, the more I know it and, consequently the more I wonder how I'll feel about it. The more I wonder, the more tension seems to exist between what I expect to feel and what I actually feel. The rationalisation of those two vectors, expectation and realisation, gives the same kind of intense pay-off that I feel when I watch an Opera.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299604/#Comment_299604" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-06T07:46:52+00:00" title="November  6, 2010  7:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dramatic irony?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299615/#Comment_299615" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-06T10:46:52+00:00" title="November  6, 2010 10:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently saw a TED talk where the guy (Vilayanur Ramachandran) talked about doing research on the brain, and he found that when we watch people doing things (or see video of them doing things) there is a physical response in our brain that mirrors the action they're doing, as though our body was doing it, at a reduced level.* <br/><br/>So when you see someone on a screen jumping, there is a little response in your brain that fires off like you were the one jumping. <br/><br/>Dude giving the talk thought that this was profoundly important to how we both learn (the capacity to learn to do something by watching someone else do it) and to develop empathy (by mirroring the position of others intuitively). <br/><br/>Which made me think of this issue -- especially as some folks do it more by watching, while some folks can get the spark out of imagining someone doing it. <br/><br/>Aside from that, there are three different issues about this that come to mind: <br/><br/>1) Phatic Communication: A lot of communication, including entertainment and storytelling, isn't supposed to impart new information. It is supposed to tell you that what you already thought was so, is so. This like like telling your wife you love her, or the semi-ritualized phrases most friends groups have as a way of saying "Yes, we're still friends." A large part of what makes stories where you already know the ending have an emotional payoff is just that -- the story sets up a situation that you want to/know will turn out a certain way and then it does. The emotional "risk" is that this communication has to have something you really believe, such as that King Arthur really was a great visionary but that the world will never stand for justice save in dreams (I always cry at Camelot, even though I know its coming). That thing, in the story, looks like its being put up to question to our monkey brains -- even if it isn't really ever up to question. So when it still turns out the right way, when the sun rises ever day and things still make sense, there is a build and release of tension. <br/><br/>2) Anticipation: Others covered this already. A lot of stories are not about surprise, even ones that we haven't seen before and think are. (Batman is not going to kill the Joker or be killed by him. Didn't make that car chase any less nail biting.) Many stories are about the fulfillment of structural promises, leading to a sense of anticipation about whether or not that thing will actually come to be. You can almost always see the shape of a story coming, but its precisely the ability to form an idea of what will come and then react to either the fulfillment or denial of that idea that brings the emotional response. (This is foundational to how several schools of improv work, its all about setting up and either fulfilling or denying expectations.) So while you may know in a movie that its going to turn out this way you still have the ability to emotionally react to it, in fact, turning out that way. <br/><br/>3) Immersion: Probably this is where the brain stuff comes in. But a lot of dramatic writers have long known that you don't have to tell a new story as long as you tell a story that draws people in. Novelty is very little compared the ability for people to feel at a gut monkey level like they are involved in a situation. So when you're into it, it doesn't matter if you know its going to turn out one way. After all, when you're on a roller coaster you know its going to turn out one way -- but it doesn't stop you from screaming. <br/><br/><br/>*<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/vs_ramachandran_the_neurons_that_shaped_civilization.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ted.com/talks/vs_ramachandran_the_neurons_that_shaped_civilization.html</a> -- this shit is bad ass.
