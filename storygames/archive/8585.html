That's actually one of the ways to make task failure better. Just plain failure gets boring quickly (but not immediately), so a high whiff game (or situation) will likely treat failure as blocking your contributions. If, on the other hand, you have a variety of ways to fail - many of which are quite distinct, then failure itself is interesting. Look at Elfs - where character's failure does not equal player failure. <br/><br/>You could imagine a similar problem arising in a conflict resolution game where, let's say, your premise is "can you protect the people you care about?" What happens after the fifth consecutive conflict where yet another friend, family member or lover is killed in spite of your efforts. Baring some shift in your premise, you'll encounter the whiff effect just as much - the game will rapidly become about as interesting as repeatedly being told "Nope." <br/><br/>In each case you could shift your interest. Not "Do I succed?" but "How pathetically silly are we." (I've had a d20 game drift that way beautifully after 4 consecutive failures on a basic climb roll.) Or "Can I protect?" but, "How do I cope with unstoppable loss." <br/><br/>The real point is to only bring the dice in when they make the game more interesting, and not do so when they won't. Figuring out when that is, well, it's something we are always learning.<br/><br/>    - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190316/#Comment_190316" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T15:53:07+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  3:53PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thor</cite><br/>1, is there a better way to say it?<br/>2, am I completely wrong?</blockquote>\nThe easy one first: No, you're not completely wrong. <br/><br/>As for the first question... <br/><br/>A long time ago, someone gave me what is without a doubt the best piece of writing advice I've ever received: "Figure out what you're trying to say, then write that down."<br/><br/>So, what are you trying to say?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190320/#Comment_190320" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T15:58:42+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  3:58PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>The real point is to only bring the dice in when they make the game more interesting, and not do so when they won't.</blockquote>\nThat's an interesting point, and one that's subtly different from what Thor's saying.

Some systems have Task Resolution, some don't.  And so on...  How to phrase these things really depends on how a system works.<br/><br/>So, when you're writing it, it really depends on the system.  With that said, I know my rule of thumb for when I play <i>Sorcerer</i> is, "When someone wants something to happen, and the someone actively doesn't want that to happen, then roll the dice."<br/><br/>Now, some systems support that, and others don't.  Here's an example from a conversation taking place over at the <i>Sorcerer</i> Forum boards...<br/><br/><i>Let's review the basic rule: if Adam says to Belvedere, "Sit down!", and Belvedere doesn't want to, then there has to be a dice roll. For purposes of the example, let's say Adam is an NPC and Belvedere is a player-character.<br/><br/>The dice are rolled, and Belvedere loses, to the tune of three victories for Adam. You're the player. Belvedere is your character. What can you do?<br/><br/>1. You can sit down.<br/><br/>2. You can do anything else, but if dice are involved in the "anything else," then you have a three-dice penalty.</i><br/><br/>Notice, that for any result, because of the <i>Sorcerer</i> rules, the story "keeps going."  The dice are only rolled because something is going to change.  Someone is:<br/>a) winning<br/>b) backing down<br/>c) shifting the conflict in a new direction when they refuse to back down<br/><br/>So, no matter what happens status between opposing interests has changed or continues to shift until the change in status is settled.  That's interesting no matter what.<br/><br/>I don't always know ahead of time when a die roll will make the game more interesting, but I do know that when conflicting interests meet <i>that is interesting right then and there</i>.  I then introduce the dice to resolve a conflict because I want a resolution that a) takes the responsibility of the resolution off my shoulders, b) helps provide unexpected results (which the <i>Sorcerer</i> system does.)<br/><br/>My rule of thumb, "When someone wants something to happen, and the someone actively doesn't want that to happen, then roll the dice," works, then, because once we start rolling dice interesting things are happening.<br/><br/>What is the context of the system you're using?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190461/#Comment_190461" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T15:00:00+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  3:00PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something that might help you here is Theatrix' flowcharts if you can get a hold of them somewhere.
