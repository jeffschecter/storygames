I almost didn\u2019t submit it because, quite frankly, it\u2019s a rewrite of Sorcerer for a swashbuckling feel and removes demons from the equation.  For the game to be fully developed I think the setting would need to be expanded to be on par with what you find in The Shadow of Yesterday.  I\u2019m not particularly interested in \u201cdefending\u201d my design because I\u2019m not particularly impressed with it myself.  I am, however, interested in discussing some principles behind it because I think they relate to something in discussions that frustrates me.<br/><br/>In one of the early posts of the Little Game Chef feedback thread Eero wrote, \u201cplayers have no onus to be concerned and responsible for the story, as they only have to take care of their character and advocate for his interests; the story is created by the process of play itself, not by a self-censoring, creativity-draining process of invention.\u201d  He was describing one particular design trend in Story Now focused games.  What Eero wrote also happens to be my personal definition of Immersion and what I was trying to design the game to do.<br/><br/>That is why I smiled and laughed when Graham wrote, \u201cBut I'm not sure what the game's about or how the mechanics support it. Is it, for example, about Passion? If so, I'd like to see more mechanical role for the Passions. \u2026 There's the thing that the players should enact their Passion at the table, but the Passions seem mainly like goals \u2026 and don't really feed into the mechanics.\u201d  To which I say: Yes, exactly. That\u2019s the point.  I\u2019ve recently become fascinated with non-mechanical systemic components that are absolutely *vital* to the way a game works.  To attach, say, some kind of pacing mechanic that tracks how far you are from achieving your Passion detracts from the goal of, \u201cthey only have to take care of their character and advocate for his interests; the story is created by the process of play itself.\u201d<br/><br/>Step back from the Fudge dice mechanics for a minute and look at the whole cycle of play.  The game starts with an (I hope) evocative setting.  That\u2019s why I say I think the setting needs to be expanded.  If the setting doesn\u2019t grab your attention then the entire system literally collapses.  From the setting the players build characters as localized representations of their enthusiasm for the setting.  This is expressed in their Passions, Starting Situations and Nouns.<br/><br/>The GM then takes the Nouns and creates what amounts to an intermediate layer of setting between the global evocative material and the ultra-localized player material.  Basically a broad but localized situation.  It\u2019s interesting that Graham really likes Nouns since all I did was describe in more detail what a Sorcerer GM is expected to do with the material the players put on the back of their character sheets.  In some sense Sorcerer starts with a character\u2019s position (Kicker + Back of Sheet / Starting Situation + Nouns) and to that I added velocity (Passion).<br/><br/>Play itself is organized into a sequence of scenes.  The GM is expected to \u201cdeliver\u201d the material from the intermediate situation layer by (fictionally) positioning that material relative to the character\u2019s Passions, specifically to the end of giving the players opportunities to make in-character choices and actions about the intersection of their Passions and the Situation.  Finally, Passions provide a creative marker for identifying a climax (or at least significant shift in thematic focus) and resolution.<br/><br/>The above is the *real* design of the game.  Notice that the character\u2019s Passion is what informs the creative decisions of play all the way through out.  During character creation it forms the connective tissue between the character and the setting.  It therefore, indirectly informs Nouns which inform the GM during situation creation.  Passions are the creative benchmark for the GM\u2019s scene framing and the Players\u2019 choices and actions.  And in the end, they\u2019re the milestone by which the group identifies an ending.<br/><br/>So when Graham writes, \u201cI'd like to see more mechanical role for the Passions.\u201d  It expresses my frustration perfectly.  Because, dude, the Passions are the *central* creative systemic component of the design.  It just doesn\u2019t affect the *dice*.  What I want from the mechanics AFTER everything has been positioned around the character\u2019s Passion is two things:  1) Create unpredictable consequences for character choices and action, hence the focus on in-fiction inter-character conflicts.  2) Generate more situational detailing that can inform later creative decisions, hence the focus on a multi-exchange conflicts (as opposed to Primetime Adventure style single resolution method).  The Passion doesn\u2019t need to interact mechanically with the resolution system because we don\u2019t even deploy the system without a solid fictional foundation built on the character\u2019s Passion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201017/#Comment_201017" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T17:07:17+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  5:07PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, is this a particularly stellar example of this design principle?  Probably not.  But that\u2019s where my more general frustration comes into play.  Sometimes I see someone say something like, \u201ceverything cool seemed to come from the players and not the mechanics.\u201d And they seem to totally fail to notice (and credit) all the other non-mechanical systemic stuff that was informing and shaping the cool stuff that \u201ccame from the players.\u201d<br/><br/>Another one is someone gets all excited about how easy it is to take the mechanics of a game a do something else with them totally failing to notice (or credit) the fact that those mechanics were designed to rest on a bed of whole bunch of other systemic considerations that vitally *inform* in-play decisions about the mechanics.  The fact they managed to create (i.e. design) an alternative systemic bed that happens to ALSO inform in-play decisions about those mechanics in a workable way DOES NOT mean that the original elements \u201cdon\u2019t matter.\u201d<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201022/#Comment_201022" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T17:52:57+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  5:52PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2009 6:00PM by Graham.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was probably being lazy when I suggested "a more mechanical role for the Passions". You're right: it shouldn't be hardwired into the die roll. That'd be hideous: roll an extra die if you use your Passion. Awful.<br/><br/>What I wanted, I think, was structure in the game to support the Passions. In Dogs In The Vineyard, for example, there are structures to push play in a particular direction: town creation, instructions such as "say yes or roll the dice". That's the sort of support I wanted for the Passions: not direct mechanical support, feeding into the die roll, but rules that focussed the game on the Passions. It's quite possible that, as you suggest, those rules were there and I missed them.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201025/#Comment_201025" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T18:07:00+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  6:07PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>In that case, I agree with you.  When I was working on the first part I wanted to put in more things that stemmed off the character's Passion but couldn't think of anything.  An example, was that I was thinking about trying to work "Midnight" in as a scene type.  That something special relative to your Passion could happen if you declared a "Midnight" scene but that totally broke my basic principle of having the players not have to consider The Story in a structural sense.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't mean to come off as "picking" on your comments.  I just found it amusing that your comments happened to fall directly into my "trap" regarding my design goals.  So I couldn't help but laugh like a maniacal villain on the cusp of having his plans coming to fruition.  It gave me an excuse to talk about this topic which I've been dancing around for a while.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
