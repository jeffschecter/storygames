At least, for now.<br/><br/>I'm hoping to get some criticism and feedback on this idea. Also, if there's a game out there that's already doing this, and better, then I'd like to know that as well. I play a lot of games, but not all of them.<br/><br/>There are six classes in FB:\n<ul>\n<li>Fighter<br/></li><li>Fighter/Thief<br/></li><li>Thief<br/></li><li>Thief/Mage<br/></li><li>Mage<br/></li><li>Mage/Fighter</li></ul>\nCharacter creation is blah blah blah. Something about Strength and Dexterity. And there are swords and spells and whatnot.<br/><br/>Here's what I'm trying to do with the system:<br/><br/>When you fight, you roll a number of d6s equal to your Combat score (or your Magic score, if you're casting a spell, et cetera). But when you execute an action in tandem with another character, you add to your chances of success. Both players announce the tactic that they're going to employ, and then the round begins.<br/><br/>Example: Fighter and Thief are in a fight with an ogre. If the fighter attacks, he rolls 4 dice, because his combat score is 4. Then something happens. He hits, he misses. But if the fighter and the thief want to execute a tactical assault, the chances go up. The fighter and thief decide that they're going to do a Distract/Backstab maneuver. This means that the fighter makes a lot of noise during the attack, and the thief steps in to do a backstab.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.dread-rpg.com/fb.jpg"/><br/><br/>This is the layout of the classes. Each class has a diametric opposite. The opposite of the fighter (focus on combat) is the mage/thief (focus on magic/stealth). <br/><br/>The distance from your tactical partner on this chart determines the number of extra dice that you get. For each step away from your class, you get an extra die, to a maximum of 3. For example, if you are a fighter, and you're working with the fighter/mage, you each get an extra die when executing a tactical maneuver together. If you're working with the mage, you get 2 extra dice. And if it's the mage/thief, you both get 3 extra dice. <br/><br/>There are also going to be special maneuvers for three people, for four, and so forth. The challenge is that these must be chosen prior to combat, and once combat begins, you're locked into it. If the mage's fireball spell doesn't kill the ogre, and the fighter's supposed to charge in and kill the necromancer, then the ogre's still going to be there, all burned and pissed-off.<br/><br/>It's also possible to do non-combat maneuvers, such as good cop/bad cop interrogations, or non-combat spellcasting.<br/><br/>So, that's where I'm at with this sudden brainstorm. Hopefully, I've explained this all in a way that makes sense. What are your thoughts/questions/criticisms?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Rafael                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96517/#Comment_96517" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T09:01:48+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  9:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it.

That's kind of what I have in mind -- each maneuver is kind of a 'stunt' with a funky name attached to it. It's almost like a military tactic that everyone's familiar with, in the same way that in kung fu movies, everyone knows what 'tiger claw strike' means. So the players agree that they're going to take out the ogres with 'crimson eagle claw', and each one scratches off a point of [resource], and then the round begins and they roll bonuses accordingly.<br/><br/>I like the idea that you have to have a special item in order to execute certain combos. Maybe not a magic item, but a condition of some kind -- another resource, or a specific level of X ability...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96838/#Comment_96838" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T07:32:44+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  7:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, if you make a game like that, I'd be hella interested and jealous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96925/#Comment_96925" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T11:19:49+00:00" title="September 17, 2007 11:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2007 11:30AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I <b>have</b> to do it now.<br/><br/>Believe I'll call it "Blood Red", after one of my favorite Slayer songs.<br/><br/>Here's another thought (and I know that this is just subjective wankery, but I'm genuinely curious): How many d6s is too many?

It's obviously going to make more sense when I get my copy of the book, but just flipping through the threads, I can see that the combat is, in fact, both gritty and detailed. As you noted.<br/><br/>One of the things that I'm curious about is the way that targeting is going to work. <br/><br/>For example, you've got a Fighter, a Thief, and a Mage. They're facing three Brigands. <br/><br/>The heroes agree that they'll executed a Flaming Chicken Stomp, meaning that the Fighter attacks head-on, the Thief stays back and body-blocks anyone who gets near the Mage (with his shortsword and buckler), and the Mage casts a Strength spell on the Fighter, turning him into a tank. Mechanically, this means that the Fighter gets some extra dice when attacking, and the Mage gets a lot of extra dice when defending (some of which are his, and some of which are due to the actions of the Thief).<br/><br/>The Brigands decide that the mage has to die, because of the threat he poses. The Fighter can stab and chop, but the Mage can throw fire and lightning. So they agree to take him down. Brigand 1 will rush the Fighter, and Brigands 2 and 3 will rush the Mage.<br/><br/>At that point, it's all about who goes first, really, so Initiative or whatever is going to play a major role in this game. First blood is really going to matter.<br/><br/>So I rolled some dice at random and got the following combat order:<br/>Fighter<br/>Thief<br/>Brigand 2<br/>Brigand 1<br/>Brigand 3<br/>Mage<br/><br/>The Fighter gets two attacks, so he targets Brigand 1 and Brigand 2, figuring that the spell will make a successful attack instantly lethal, so he'll be taking out two of three enemies in the first round. He kills Brigand 1.<br/><br/>The Thief's going to play defense, so he delays his attack until someone gets in range. Brigand 2 rushes the mage, and is attacked by the Thief. But the blow isn't fatal, so Brigand 2 rushes the Mage.<br/><br/>The Flaming Chicken Stomp gives the Mage a lot of extra dice to defend with, so he's able to survive both Brigand 2 and Brigand 3 when they attack him. Then the Mage gets to cast a spell of some kind.<br/><br/>So after that, we roll Initiative again. If, instead of the Flaming Chicken Stomp, which costs X Cooperation points, they had decided to use the Itchy Squirrel Slap, whichs costs Y Cooperation points, then their next round would already be decided. Because the Itchy Squirrel Slap isn't a one-round activity, it's a multi-round tactic. That makes it more expensive, in terms of Cooperation points, more risky, because you never know how things are going to turn out, but more effective (if successful). So there's a reason to do it, but there's also a reason not to do it.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97326/#Comment_97326" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T16:27:08+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  4:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thought 1)  Get rid of initiative.  It all happens simultaneously.<br/><br/>This requires adapting thought 2), however, which is as follows:  Imagine that every round is divided into, say, 5 sub-rounds, or "volleys" if you will.  :-)<br/><br/>Now, Flaming Chicken Stomp goes like this:<br/><br/>Fighter -- Volley 1: Attack, Volley 2: Block, Volley 3: Gather Power (leaving him open to attack!), Volley 4: Stomp! (the big attack), Volley 5: Dodge<br/>Mage -- Volley 1: Gather Power, Volley 2: Gather Power, Volley 3: Avoid, Volley 4: Avoid, Volley 5: Attack<br/>Thief -- Volley 1: Block, Volley 2: Strike, Volley 3: Riposte, Volley 4: , Volley 5: Block<br/><br/>So the Bad Guys have to try to script their moves so that they are Blocking when the heroes are attacking, and Attack when the heroes are open to Attack.  (Yes, this does mean that you want to stab people while they're stabbing you.  Across multiple encounters, this could prove very disadvantageous to the PCs.)<br/><br/>Thought 3) In Burning Wheel, you only have to script your *actions* in advance, but in Blood Red, it might make sense to script your targets ahead of time as well.<br/><br/>Thought 4) What if the Bad Guys always scripted exactly five moves in advance, while the PCs might have to script more, leaving themselves unable to change tactics for slightly longer, with the risk being offset by greater reward, i.e., bigger combo.<br/><br/>Thought 5) Or maybe Bad Guys should just be pre-scripted based on their monster type.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97332/#Comment_97332" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T16:47:33+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  4:47PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would agree on skipping an Initiative roll and let things happen simultaneously.  I would suggest adding to the lists of actions Speedy Versions of all of them.  So a Speedy Attack would happen before a regular attack but you get less dice in exchange for going first.  Or some varient on that anyway.<br/><br/>You'll need to figure out how to handle movement.  An abstracted notion would work best I think, but I not sure if BW's version of attack ranges would suit.<br/><br/>Just a gut feeling in general but creating the combos with multiple characters to is going to cause great complexity with all the possible interactions.  So my instinct is to keep the base actions very limited and simple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97407/#Comment_97407" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T20:48:03+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  8:48PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed -- keep the base actions simple, and name all the various possible combinations* that will arise therefrom.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*Actually permutations, depending on how you implement things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97426/#Comment_97426" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T23:46:55+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 11:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Thought 4) What if the Bad Guys always scripted exactly five moves in advance, while the PCs might have to script more, leaving themselves unable to change tactics for slightly longer, with the risk being offset by greater reward, i.e., bigger combo.<br/><br/>Thought 5) Or maybe Bad Guys should just be pre-scripted based on their monster type.</blockquote>\nI think both of these are really intreesting. Could this be a way to represent monster intelligence? Big, dumb beasts script more turns in advance, and so can't adjust to PC tactics so well, while more clever monsters can react every round or two. And maybe diferent monsters have access to different orders. So maybe an ogre only has access to the Strike and Power-Up moves, for e.g. Maybe some monsters have unique actions ("fire breath" "sink through stone" etc).<br/><br/>I agree with the idea to dump initiative, too. I think it'd be fun to work out exactly what happened in the round after all the dice has rolled and the dust has settled.<br/><br/>Do you have any ideas on how the classes will differ? Will they all be equally damaging in all circumstances? Or might some do more damage against certain monsters, or whatever?<br/><br/>I want to play this game <i>right now</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97502/#Comment_97502" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T10:00:06+00:00" title="September 19, 2007 10:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Rich, Matt, and Chris,<br/><br/>Thanks for all the great comments and ideas! <br/><br/>I'm at work now, so I can't respond at length, but I'm going to spend some time putting together a playable PDF.
