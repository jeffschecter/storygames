My friends and I think it would be a good idea to try a play-by-chat game online, in part to deal with bad internet, but also because players tend to be a bit more thoughtful about what they say when typing. We used to play on fantasy grounds and we had some epic player interaction. <br/><br/>I'm probably going to use <a href="http://roll20.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://roll20.net</a>.<br/><br/>Does anyone have an idea how many players is too many in a situation like that? We usually play traditional systems (BRP) in a narrative style, and I've been running a lot of Dungeon World. I don't know what system I'm going to use yet, but I'd be open to suggestions. It seems like 3 players is the max for a Skype game. Has it been your experience that chat play can handle more or fewer players?<br/><br/>Any general wisdom or tips for running a successful game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421259/#Comment_421259" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T11:13:29+00:00" title="September  9, 2013 11:13AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2013 11:13AM by David Artman.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whatever chat system you use should support multiple, simultaneously viewed chat channels.

Otherwise, you get some odd out-of-sync confusions.<br/><br/>Go old skool: have a third channel for OOC Player Planning and then only let the Caller enter info into the main narration channel.<br/><br/>Save ALL channel logs: the narration one is half way to being a story (and a great AP post, if you post long-form AP); and the rules one is a great way to recap for things like XP or skill checks.

Another thing that made Wave so rocking is the text transmitted in real time, so you could SEE what they were typing as they typed it (allowing you to grok it as they deliver it, thereby speeding up response times).<br/><br/>Ah...

It tends to stall the game when there's quiet space of "Typing..."<br/><br/>I agree that having OOC and IC is a must; I tend to handle dice mechanics in the OOC channel itself. It's a sort of "at the table" thing. Also make sure your players are all on the same page with tense and person. It's challenging when one person is typing 1st person present tense and another is typing 3rd person past tense.<br/><br/>Finally, get your players to put some thought into it, but make sure they're not taking it too seriously. I had a number of players who took too much time crafting their chat prose, and it really slowed the game down.<br/><br/>Interesting point: Wave's real-time text transmission got transferred over to Google Documents, so you could open a shared Google Doc and have the same effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/seanhess" title="seanhess"><img alt="seanhess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/seanhess">seanhess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421279/#Comment_421279" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T14:39:36+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  2:39PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...

The collaborator chat would make a good OOC channel. The only flaw I can see is not having a dice roller in there. I'm looking into seeing if it's scriptable now, but I don't know if it's possible. Maybe you can load the google document in a google hangout and have a rolling bot in that chat. <br/><br/>Is there any demand for a fully featured realtime-chat play system? I'm a self-employed programmer looking for ways to do damage, and most of the systems I've seen are pretty primitive. Roll20 is pretty sweet, but I wonder if a system designed from the ground-up for text-chat first would be much better. Anyway, I don't know if many people even play that way. I know the PbP community is big, but I'm not really interested in playing asynchronously and I imagine many people share that opinion.

I'm picking a system. I was originally thinking of using an AW variant, since I like Dungeon World so much, but it seems like you need one that was hand-designed for a particular setting, and I'd like to run some kind of modern pulpy horror (like aliens, or World of Darkness, etc). <br/><br/>My finalists for a generic system are:<br/>Cthulhu Dark (using conditions for harm, like Lady Blackbird)<br/>Lady Blackbird<br/><br/>They seem to have different strengths and weaknesses. I've found that in LB, the characters get too awesome too quickly for a longer campaign, but maybe that's ok. I could keep it shorter. I already miss the 6-, 7-8, 10+ from AW, so I like how LB has you escalate on a failure. But LB always struck me as only being appropriate for a one-shot: that it doesn't scale well into something larger. <br/><br/>I love that Cthulhu Dark lets the characters be awesome. I'm worried that my players might want it a little more crunchy than this (Hey! I have an automatic weapon, how come I don't get a bonus?), but after playing DW enough, I think I can pull those kind of advantages in the fiction, or give an extra die if appropriate. <br/><br/>In a chat-based game, a subtle change to the interaction of calling for rolls can change things dramatically. For example, in LB, the GM is supposed to set a difficulty, which is an extra communication step not necessary in Dungeon World or Cthulhu Dark. <br/><br/>Any thoughts on these, or recommendations? Any of my assumptions wrong?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
