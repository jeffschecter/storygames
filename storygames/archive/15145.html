Pretty much from the beginning, this one guy, douglas, has been steadily siphoning away all the fun of D&amp;D; for me, and just a few minutes ago I got fed up and buddy's game. Now, I like metagame riffing and rules-lawyering as much as the next chap, but even for me there was a point at which I just couldn't take the inane pedantry anymore. Which is kind of sad, since I enjoy gaming with my friend and everyone else in the game is cool beans. The thing is, though, I'm about ready to just ditch the whole game. I'm liking the concept of Dungeon World, and I plan to start a game of it this Friday evening (look out Adventurer's Guild, here I come!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess the things I am wondering about are:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Have you had a similarly aggravating experience/person where you felt you had to leave a long-standing group?<br/>\n-Have you thought about leaving D&amp;D; behind to become nothing more than a fond, nostalgic reverie? Have you ACTUALLY done so?<br/>\n-Anyone interested in a fuckton of 3.5 material (okay, maybe not a METRIC fuckton)?<br/>\n-Do you think I was being unfair?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344300/#Comment_344300" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T19:33:21+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  7:33PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

Yup. I think we all have. I haven't talked to my previous group in years; it turns out some of them were actual sociopaths rather than just socially awkward. This may not be a common experience, but the thing to take from it is that sometimes you just don't get along with people. It's not worth sticking around to try and appease other people. You've only got the one life; why waste it doing stuff you don't enjoy?<br>2. I haven't played 3.5 since about 2005. I flirted with Pathfinder for about a session before giving up.<br>3. Heh. Don't think you're going to get a lot of hits here.<br>4. I stand with Marshall: sleep on it. Have a night's rest after something upsetting happens does wonders for one's perspective.<br><br/>Additionally, good luck! Dungeon World is great. Don't be afraid to ask us questions; I think most of us here are quite taken with the game. I'd reckon that it would be hard to find a person who hasn't played Dungeon World or its parent, Apocalypse World, on these boards.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344305/#Comment_344305" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T19:54:30+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  7:54PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2011 7:56PM by Johnstone.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

A little unfair to say this Douglas guy is draining the fun maybe. He obviously likes the game of rules optimization, which you've decided you don't want to play anymore. It's certainly not unfair to leave a game you don't enjoy anymore -- rather the opposite, actually. Although, you might want to dl something like microlite20 and keep a few setting/monster books for when you have 3.x fans over and want to play something they know that isn't heavy in rules optimization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344306/#Comment_344306" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T20:03:05+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  8:03PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I have microlite20 and several other games that could benefit from settings and monster books.

In my case it was the death of a million small (aggravating) cuts. Nothing horrible, just lots and lots of mediocrity in one group, where at the same time I was forming other groups where the fun was explosive and immediate and constant. The comparison helped me rip off the band-aid and split.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>-Have you thought about leaving D&amp;D behind to become nothing more than a fond, nostalgic reverie? Have you ACTUALLY done so?</blockquote>\nI left 3e behind long ago, but then I played in an E6 (up to six level only, no further) sandbox game and it was fun as hell! In fact, I bought Pathfinder with the sole purpose of running another E6 game at some point (which means I'm only using like 20% of the book... eh, not a good deal in hindsight, but all 3.5 core books were expensive, and I like the Pathfinder art anyway).<br><br>So I don't have a hate on for D&amp;D/3.X. It's a game, one of many. As it stood, it frustrated me at hardcore levels. The E6 hack by Ryan S made that game wonderful and playable for me again, essentially correcting all the hangups I had with it (both rules and feel). In time, I came to appreciate that!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>-Anyone interested in a fuckton of 3.5 material (okay, maybe not a METRIC fuckton)?</blockquote>\nEh, maybe a corebook, but likely you can turn an okay deal (enough cash to maybe buy 1-2 games you want to try) on eBay, Craigslist or Half Price Books or something. Good luck!<br>As for me, while I got rid of my 3e stuff (and recently got the Pathfinder core book, nothing more), and most of my 4e stuff save for the core-core books; there's a special place in my heart for D&amp;D. I cut my teeth on AD&amp;D 2nd edition, and I still keep that core book around (and only that core book; plus some signed Planescape stuff), even though I'll likely never play it again.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>-Do you think I was being unfair?</blockquote>\nHmmm. Private communication (emails, etc) on sensitive stuff vs public long threads on a play forum are probably in better form, or meeting up with them F2F to explain would have been better. But if a clean break is what you needed, then you got it.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344326/#Comment_344326" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T21:40:02+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  9:40PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, PMs would probably have been more appropriate, yes, but F2F isn't really an option.

It's easy to forget that even if you've yourself made your peace with the fact that D&amp;D 3rd edition is not an universal story game, there are still humongous amounts of people who expect to play it in this way, and quite often do successfully. It's no wonder that issues like rules lawyering are so very current and near to the hearts of D&amp;D players.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>-Have you had a similarly aggravating experience/person where you felt you had to leave a long-standing group?</blockquote>\nWhen I GMed 3rd edition D&amp;D early last decade for several years, we had our rough spots in the group. Some people left the game due to pretty similar differences about creative agenda, while others left simply because they didn't with with the group socially. My original intent for the game had been to make it encompassing and welcoming to different styles of play (I even added a heavy layer of Forge-based state of the art homebrew elements to the game to enable dramatic and narrativist play better), but in practice this standard mostly acted as a winnowing-ground for players, leaving us with those who were most interested in doing what D&amp;D does best; the more story-oriented, rules-light and challenge-averse players tended to drop off, while the hard core we developed continues to this day to get along famously, playing everything D&amp;D from 4th edition to OSR.\n<blockquote>-Have you thought about leaving D&amp;D behind to become nothing more than a fond, nostalgic reverie? Have you ACTUALLY done so?</blockquote>\nWell, D&amp;D never was the big thing for us here in my local Finnish play culture that it is in the USA. I played the game seriously for the first time in 2002 or so, well over a decade after I started roleplaying. Until the TSR collapse and WotC buyoff I'd largely lived with the impression that D&amp;D was a permanent footnote in roleplaying history.<br/><br/>Closest I get to this experience of abandonment is when I decided to end our 3rd edition campaign in 2005-ish in favour of focusing more on Forge-style proge games. It wasn't the soul-shattering creative leap that giving up D&amp;D is for those who came to the hobby with it and have done most of their roleplaying with D&amp;D, but it was my most successful campaign to date, and the game was working swimmingly, so it was the first time I ever walked away from a <i>successful</i> roleplaying game because I wanted to up my creative performance even further. This was probably the hardest part for me, as it meant arranging for the group to continue with a different GM while I looked for new people to play different games with. Fortunately we're all sane and adult people, so all this went off pretty much without a hitch, and now that I've been doing more D&amp;D once more (this time in an OSR context), we've played more together with the old crew as well. Besides, everybody is growing wiser with age, and even the hardcore D&amp;D guys have been enjoying forays to TSoY and other such games over the years, so it's not like I lost any friends over it.\n<blockquote>-Anyone interested in a fuckton of 3.5 material (okay, maybe not a METRIC fuckton)?</blockquote>\nNah, I've got my own collection. I recommend you hold onto yours as well - it might not seem that way now, but odds are you'll enjoy these gaming materials anew in 15 years or so when the 3rd edition revival rolls up. Then again, it'll likely be even more trivial to get this stuff in electronic format then.\n<blockquote>-Do you think I was being unfair?</blockquote>\nIf you really need to know, a bit. Of course I don't know you guys, but Douglas doesn't seem like an "inane pedant" in that thread to me. He's just playing 3rd edition D&amp;D hardcore, which is a fine and respectable way of playing the game. In fact, I wouldn't personally care for anything else when it comes to 3rd edition, as the other way pretty much devolves into trivial freeforming and arbitrary GM calls that amount to following the GM's aesthetics over any joint play procedure, which is so much easier without bringing the massive 3rd edition rules construction with you in the first place. I'm the sort of guy for whom the procedure is the game, so if we're not going to play by the rules, then by all means lets switch to some rules we're willing to play by. I just find it sad when so many people insist on playing D&amp;D (especially 3rd edition) when all they want is light-weight fantasy adventure story game experience. 3rd edition D&amp;D is a challenge-based skirmish wargame rules-set, so I have sympathy for Douglas wanting to play by the rules and make any changes in a democratic and transparent manner instead of having the GM make arbitrary judgement calls.<br/><br/>To give you an idea of how this seems to me, I should say that I'd probably be entertained by playing with Douglas myself, based on what I saw there. He argues gogently about how the rules work, but seems perfectly willing to go through houseruling procedures as long as that happens in an informed manner instead of having the GM do snap judgments in the middle of a fight. Framing this as "rules lawyering" is not useful, as that sort of language demonizes what some people think of as the core of 3rd edition D&amp;D gameplay experience. I definitely admit that it's not always easy to bridge these play culture and creative agenda issues and communicate clearly, but what you have in that thread doesn't seem problematic at all. The GM seems a bit defensive about his perfectly acceptable decision to not have standard races in his world (something about how his elves don't have sleep magic immunity), but that's just superficial communication friction, nothing to lose sleep over.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think that your decision to not continue playing the game where you find the contents of play inane is a very fine thing. I mean, even people who should have nothing invested in it (like me) often find that rules manipulation is one of 3rd edition's central facets, so why try to make it do something else? The world is full of games that do other things better.

I think that I may have miscommunicated both here and there on at least one point, though: I enjoy pedantry to a point. I actually like figuring out how rules go together, but do it with an eye towards keeping things as RAW as possible, insofar as RAW isn't crazy. On the other hand, Douglas likes to twist the RAW to gain whatever advantage for the player he possibly can.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample: The rules text in Tome of Battle for Warblades says that in order to refresh all  of their maneuvers, spend a swift action followed by either a melee attack or spending a standard action doing nothing (representing a fancy flourish of one's weapon).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I read that and think "Cool, so I spend a swift action, then either make a(1) melee attack or waste my standard action if no bad guys are near enough to make one."<br/>\n<br/>\nDouglas reads the same words and thinks "...Hm, 'a melee attack,' eh? Well it doesn't specify that it can't be followed up with a full-attack action, because you are making at least one attack." Now, you have to understand, that even if you don't find this particular one to be a big deal, he reads Every. Single. Phrase. this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, this type of rules-lawyering is the disruptive type I don't care for, which tends to subvert the DM's ability to keep everyone on the same page, and forces him and myself (the rules-savvy people within the game other than douglas) to spend more time and energy debating rules than on playing the game. To me, that's not cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the guy is just <i>rude</i>. The DM asks us all if we're cool with his niece and nephew (late high school-age and college-age, respectively) joining the game, and we were all like "Welcome aboard!" Additionally, we've had a long-standing rule that says if you don't post within 3 days, the DM will co-opt your character to keep things moving, playing it as faithfully to the way you usually play as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost immediately douglas was calling for their expulsion, because on a few occasions, the "rule of 3" was invoked. Remember, this was the guy whom we were nice enough to keep around after he copypasted and deleted a post seven times in order to ace a saving throw roll, which we had all felt was cheating and unfair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344365/#Comment_344365" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T08:33:29+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  8:33AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "The Rule of 3," I like it.

Even rules with lighter/simpler rules or less necessary rules can have this issue, though. I would up seeing a two year running LARP (Changeling the Lost) tear apart because the players were trying to have fun and the person running the game was being a rules nazi. This would be fine if he was following the book, but every night saw a new house rule off the cuff just so the GM could have his NPCs win every conflict. I've always been a believer that the game (well, WoD/CtL in particular, not every game is meant to do this) is about building a communal narrative, not about either the GM or players could "win." In the end, the GMs desire to win wound up with all of the good players moving on, and the people that love to bring drama and make everyone around them miserable stayed. Worked out nicely if you ask me, they go what they wanted, we got what we wanted.\n<blockquote>-Have you thought about leaving D&amp;D behind to become nothing more than a fond, nostalgic reverie? Have you ACTUALLY done so?</blockquote>\nLike I said, never really into DnD. I certainly have some nostalgia moments from some of the games I have been in, but those have always been based on the setting, characters, and other players. I can't say I have a single moment that sticks out that's actually related to the rules...\n<blockquote>-Anyone interested in a fuckton of 3.5 material (okay, maybe not a METRIC fuckton)?</blockquote>\nKeep it. You can find inspiration in the strangest places, and there's no reason to cut yourself off from such things.\n<blockquote>-Do you think I was being unfair?</blockquote>\nEero raises a lot of interesting points concerning your fairness and the way DnD is played in general. There's one thing he says that I think is particularly worth looking at (though it starts to move a little tangential to your question...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>He argues gogently about how the rules work, but seems perfectly willing to go through houseruling procedures as long as that happens in an informed manner instead of having the GM do snap judgments in the middle of a fight. Framing this as "rules lawyering" is not useful, as that sort of language demonizes what some people think of as the core of 3rd edition D&amp;D gameplay experience.</blockquote>\nDouglas' obsession with the rules is a way that many people choose to (and enjoy) play DnD. Honestly, the game is essentially designed to be played in a way that is rules-centric and narrative-light. As Eero said, it's really a "challenge-based skirmish wargame rules-set," and Douglas is more interested in that aspect of it than the narrative that results out of it. The trouble is, I (much like you, I'm guessing), find that the actual heart DnD is my least favourite part of it, and the narrative is the real winner for me. That's why my friends and I have always played other games, DnD played as it's meant to is really just math in a fantasy setting and it doesn't do it for us. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it, it's just not our cup of tea.<br><br>Back to your actual fairness question, I can illustrate again with something that my old group did. Every game we played, there was always a solid understanding before we started about how important (or not) the formal rules would be. Any time we brought in new people, we made it clear that we felt the rules were to facilitate our fun, and weren't the actual fun itself. The point being: if you all had an understanding that the rules were not tantamount and narrative was king, how you feel is completely fair. If there was no such understanding, it's not really fair to begrudge Douglas for playing the game as he sees it being meant to be played. Personally, I think you should talk to Douglas (or have the GM do it) and see what he's trying to get out of the game. Even if you still walk away, it would be good to understand what he's in it for, because he's not the last person you'll meet like that in the land of RPGs.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
