More precisely it is a translation draft of the playtesting version. You see, I am not a native English speaker - (you didn't see that coming, did you? Well probably you did). I wrote the thingie a year ago in Spanish, and got lots of help and some positive feedback from fellow forum members at <a href="http://www.salganalsol.com/foro/" rel="nofollow">Salgan al Sol</a>, a nice place to discuss story games matters if you are a Spanish speaker. But the game still needs more playtesting and some friendly beating.<br/><br/>So here you go. Read it, playtest it, comment it (or not). And because it is a rough translation you get to correct my grammar big time! You wouldn't miss an opportunity like that, would you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/something" title="something"><img alt="something" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/something">something</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299651/#Comment_299651" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-07T08:58:47+00:00" title="November  7, 2010  8:58AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it's a little late for this but I think I should have told something more about the game. I mean I asked some fellows "shouldn't I have explained a little about the system and stuff"? And they were all like: duh!<br/><br/>So: In this game there are two players, two worlds and just one player character called George K. who lives in both. In one world one player controls George K. and the other one acts as Game Master, and then in the other world they exchange their roles. The thing is near the end of the game one of these realities is going to be proven "the right one" and the other some kind of illusion, so the players compete trying to win the right to determine which one is which. There is a little more to the game of course, but you should read the pdf for that, shouldn't you?<br/><br/>And it won a contest! "Primero tira despu\xe9s hablamos" it was called. It was a very little contest, but I feel all glamorous now.<br/><br/>Of couse even if you are not playtesting the game grammar and sintaxis corrections, pointing out confusing portions of the text, criticism and witty one-liners are all welcomed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299662/#Comment_299662" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-07T11:20:48+00:00" title="November  7, 2010 11:20AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry that I have nothing useful to add, besides encouragement.

Thank you!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite>In the "Face cards" section, in<i>Wounds</i>you say that "a fear or flaw [is] induced or revealed by the defeat".

Or maybe it an be both?</blockquote>\nBoth indeed (induced=acquired, revealed=retconned). Although I wouldn't say "retcon": it is more like a conclusion, or something to focus on. If the wound is SELFISH this selfishness should have been at least suggested by the narration so far. Like: "You see how he only cares about himself? What a selfish bastard!". So this is something I should clarify.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite>Also, do "forced face cards" give me Victory Points and Wounds/Passions?

So the forced face cards don't have any impact in the total number of sequences (although they shorten the current sequence). The text is a little obscure about this, so good point.<br/><br/>But speaking of the minimum number of sequences: It is just 3 (plus the final sequence). For this to happen a player has to win all those three sequences, and in at least 2 of them she must win two points instead of just one. I don't know how often this can happen, but 3 sequences is probably too little, so I should look into that.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/something" title="something"><img alt="something" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/something">something</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300298/#Comment_300298" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T12:58:15+00:00" title="November 10, 2010 12:58PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Easy question: What do you think about de "game starters"?

Do they seem uninteresting?<br/><br/>The game is easy enough to hack, by the way: just a couple of well thought kickers (that work well as a pair) should be enough most of the times.

I don't think there's anything wrong in that, and it could be more a feature than a bug.

And I wanted all that while telling as little as possible, because I felt a good deal of ambiguity was necessary.<br/><br/>So yes, I feel it is a feature. And the fact that the knight story seems more straightforward doesn't bother me.
