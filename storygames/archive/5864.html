So, we used a Tarot deck instead, removed all the Major Arcana and the Knights (used Pages for Jacks, mostly because one Knight was missing already).  This seemed to add a bump to the ritual flavor of the oracle process. Next time, I think I would dim the lights and light a candle, just for the Oracle reading.<br/><br/>So here's our Oracle:<br/>QS: A warrior-priestess of a truly bloodthirsty cult. <br/>3C: The arrival at a way house of four unusual travelers. <br/>10C: The marriage of a region's most beautiful girl, necessarily virgin and without blemish, to the dead stone effigy of a harvest god. <br/>QC: The seizure of arcane powers by an arrogant and brutal wizard.<br/><br/>The player characters end up being the beautiful girl. Asha, who is also one of the four travellers with magical bells.  And Balashi, vizier to the warrior-preistess with convincing words.  <br/><br/>Some of the NPCs was the way house innkeeper (who wants to get Asha drunk and take advantage of her), the warrior-priestess (who wants to scar Asha to prevent the marriage), one of the other travellers (seeking to destroy the cult), and the brutal wizard (sister of Balashi, who wants her brother dead at the hands of his own fellow cult members and to steal Asha's magic).<br/><br/>The first conflict I feel I did wrong, although it worked out just fine.  The innkeeper strides over, gives Asha a drink on the house, and proceeds to try and get her drunk to take advantage. The player lost, but we negotiated that Asha went upstairs with him where the Innkeeper passed out (but he thinks that he got all the way) and got a little drunk dropping one of her forms by a die.<br/><br/>The second attempt at a conflict was the Warrior-Preistess had another pretty lame Best Interest, to embarass Balashi. Balashi went along with the ridiculous costume she gave him so he would look proper in the village. I discovered it wasn't a really good conflict driver.<br/><br/>Anyway, we carried on. Balashi takes Asha to the temple to prepare for her wedding, the wizard mind controls some cultists to kill Balashi, and then goes to kill Asha while he's away.  These go normal and good.  But I'm still framing conflicts in the way I'm used to, like "here's what this conflict is about. Do you get drunk and taken advantage of? Do you notice the guy following you? Do you get murdered by four dazed looking cult members?" And so on. Let me be clear, this worked okay. We had a good time and the only problem was that I felt I didn't have quite a handle on how to engage with the rules and make the shift from scene narration to conflict more smooth. As far as I could tell, I was the only one with this problem (it might also be the players were still learning the rules to notice). It just felt like I had to wrestle a gator to get the game to play right, but I've grown used to that in my last 20 years of gaming. It felt odd to be doing it in a story game, but wasn't a huge deal.<br/><br/>And then I do this:<br/><br/>After the attempt on Asha's life, she was able to best the wizard and knock her out. A man comes in who Asha thinks is one of the temple guards. She tells him to bind up the intruder and take him some where. Balashi returns and I tell his player: "That's no temple guard." And I go, "He walks past you, and only briefly looks over you and the wizard. He heads over to the stone effigy and lifts it over his head. Hurling it to the ground, it smashes into a thousand pieces."  Immediately both players respond "No he does not!"  And we grab dice.<br/><br/>That's the moment I realize, "So that's how conflict works In A Wicked Age!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131234/#Comment_131234" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T11:01:06+00:00" title="February 28, 2008 11:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is what my group calls the "no you fucking do not asshole" rule of Wicked Age conflicts: unless someone says "no you fucking do not asshole" there is no conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131262/#Comment_131262" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T12:01:09+00:00" title="February 28, 2008 12:01PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's like an even dirtier and hippier version of "Say Yes or Roll the Dice."

I told them at the onset "So that's how conflict works, you keep waying what you do until someone else doesn't want you to do that." But I guess it didn't sink in how to do that.<br/><br/>I love the way Brand put it.  I think the <b>"No You Fucking Do Not, Asshole"</b> rule should have been in the book big and bold just like "Say Yes or Roll the Dice" was in Dogs.  Because there is a difference, but it's not obvious there is a difference.

That's what I've come to realize. IAWA is not a conflict resolution mechanic, its a conflict domination mechanic. Its "Give me something shiny, or I'm gonna pick up these dice and hurt you again!" That's mindblowingly new stuff.<br/><br/>And that is why people sometimes stumble; they're still stakes setting. They "win" the die roll, but they haven't gotten what they "wanted." Injury/Exhaustion is generally not only a punishment for the loser, its a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dissappointment</span> concession for the winner.

I mean, the default damage from "I chop you with my sword" is the same as "I make you eat cotton candy with your feet." Injury/exhaustion. And then it struck me, the conflict resolution is dice + negotiation. The lethal move is a signal to the opposition. You're saying "I don't intend to stop with just a little hurtin'. I ain't stopping until you're dead.

After playing IaWA a couple times, reading the rules and Vincent's answers to questions on the Forge, I'm convinced that some key narration rules are in the text, but easy to overlook. I believe these are:<br/><br/>Narration Rules<br/>- always roll then narrate.<br/>- always describe within the forms you're rolling.<br/>- win an answer -- describe how you gain advantage.<br/>- lose an answer -- describe how you prevent the action but end up at a disadvantage.<br/>- lose completely -- admit the Challenger's last statement.<br/>- win completely as an answer -- describe complete turnabout and your finishing action.<br/><br/>Except for the free narration that triggers the start of dice rolling, every mention of player description in the dicing rules comes after the player rolls! This is different from most games I know, where one describes action, then backs it up with a roll. In IaWA, you roll dice, then back it up with description!<br/><br/>The narrations are chained together by the context and logic of described events. The last surviving description sets up the action that must be addressed by negotiation when proposing consequences. The severity of that final action demands to be addressed, so the nastier it is, the more pressure on the loser to give more. <br/><br/>At the same time, the option of taking Exhaustion or Injury puts a cap on the amount of mechanical harm that a player may choose instead of a consequence -- until they've suffered an injury or two and have a dice at zero!<br/><br/>But in the end, whether we negotiate to a story consequence or just go to Injury or Exhaustion, the action description still demands an explanation of how we go from what was declared to the result we negotiated! There may be some retcon and different groups may have different standards of how much retcon is acceptable.<br/><br/>Eg If my winning declaration is "I hack off your head!" but our result is you lose two die sizes and are still in the game, then we have to reconcile these. If we demand high fidelity to our winning statement, then we have to come up with some way the character can lose their head and still be in play -- ghosts or animate headless body or eldritch resurrection maybe (and this brings up questions of how much magic we want in the story.) Alternately, we may accept some retcon -- "the sword slashes across his throat, blood flies as he falls into the chasm. .... Later, we see him on a ledge, his throat not lethally cut but bloody...." (this is more in line with pulp and Robert Howard's writing.)<br/><br/>This is how narration matters in IaWA dice contests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
