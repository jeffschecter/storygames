Rather than derail that thread any further, I thought I'd open up a new one specifically about our game.<br/><br/>To start, I've posted an <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=29421.0" rel="nofollow">actual play thread over on the Forge</a> as that seemed the right place.  I'll follow up here with some of the questions and issues that have come up for us, since the discussion here has been so fruitful.<br/><br/>Also I thought I'd share this bit written by our Hocus player- his summary of the cult and its basic practices and beliefs:\n<blockquote><br/>It came to me, in a vision, borne by angels wreathed in flames.<br/><br/>The cult members wear the ceremonial robes of the faculty of the University of Berkeley. King Rabbit wears the chancellor's robes and carries the scepter of Berkeley, Queen Snake the academic seal.<br/><br/>Every year they make a pilgrimage (called the "*Protest March*") from Berkeley to The Sacred Mentality (i.e. Sacramento--but only the prophet can use this most sacred name). They enter the sacred temple Legislature and have a great carnival of savagery followed by a long theological dialogue (for debate offends the Sacred Mentality). Dust Horse then pleads to the Sacred Mentality.<br/><br/>The myths of the cult snap into place from there: the end began when the Dark Lion of Capitol (aka the Black Arnold) denied the great cult entrance into the temple of the Sacred Mentality. The Mentality, in despair, shut its thousand eyes that saw only sweet things, making them vanish from the world, while it stared fiercely upon the world with its thousand eyes that saw only awful things.<br/><br/>The Sacred Mentality sometimes blinks its thousand eyes that see only sweet things and the terrible hell hole of a world becomes a little less miserable. One day, when the cult has perfected itself, the eyes will open wide again, bringing in a new joyful world.<br/><br/>When things go badly, well, it means the eyes that see sweet things aren't open, so the only way to get the Sacred Mentality's attention is to do awful things (since that is all it can see). So, when things go badly, you have to bad things in order to even hope to get good things. Which, by the math, should be about a quarter of the time.<br/><br/>Since the Sacred Mentality pays special attention to its prophet, doing awful things to the prophet (while the prophet pleads for better things) is *just the most sensible thing* in the world.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259128/#Comment_259128" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T14:05:45+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  2:05PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dust Horse is kind of a fucker, but he does right by his flock.

I wanted to open this thread up again as an update and to pose some questions for the veteran playtesters that are still nagging at me before we play again tonight.  <br/><br/>In general, I should say that our experience has been getting better with each session.  As has been said elsewhere, having five players and two hour sessions is a real limitation.  What we accomplished in three sessions really should have happened in one.  This idea was proved by our one-shot, which was three players for four hours, and a lot of fun.  <br/><br/>A few highlights of scenes we've enjoyed:<br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>Dust (the Hocus) wanted to lead his caravan of followers around the impending biker gang battle happening on the road ahead.  He told his drivers to take the VW buses off-road across the burned hilltops, trying to go unnoticed (<i>acting under fire, got a weak hit</i>).  A few straggler bikers noticed them and started to follow, forcing Dust to choose- does he leave his slowest bus full of the least-useful followers behind while the rest escape?  He chooses not to.  <br/><br/>As the bikers approach, Dust tries again to lead his people to safety (<i>under fire and weak hit again</i>) and this time has to watch as his best follower, King Rabbit, circles his bus back to face the threat.  Dust chooses to send everyone else on and joins Rabbit to fight the bikers.  With his cultists armed and ready, Dust tries to intimidate the bikers (<i>aggro, miss</i>) only to find his people are sheep before wolves- they are captured, and taken before the gang boss Compton.<br/><br/>Brought before Compton in his burnt-out movie theater throne-room,  It's clear that Compton doesn't care about Dust, and that his followers are just so much meat.  Compton wants revenge on Montana (the PC Chopper), but also has designs on the Berzerkley holding.  Dust argues for the lives and safety of his people (<i>manipulate, weak hit</i>) and Compton offers him a deal- he gets his people back, intact, if he goes to Berzerkley and brings Compton someone that he wants- someone worth the trade.  And it better be good.  Dust takes the deal.<br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>Montana and her gang dominate Compton's people, breaking out of the ambush that had been set for them (2 medium gangs; strong hits on Seize the upper hand and seize the Road) and then chasing them off to loot the dead (aggro, weak hit).  The gang is high on victory and Montana looks around for her second in command, Squire- he's nowhere to be found.  Turns out he'd left at the start, escorting his new squeeze Pandora (the Skinner, who has holds on Squire) to safety.<br/><br/>So Montana leads her gang toward Berzerkley and meets Squire on his way back to them.  They all stop and the two step off their bikes, a silent distance between them.  She tries to put him in his place (<i>aggro, fail</i>), but it's no good- Squire knows he's in the wrong, but won't back down in front of everyone.  "You got no right to come down on me, Montana.  I was doing what you wanted, keeping those people safe."  He pulls out a lead pipe.  "You don't leave the gang in a fight, and you know it."   draws her machete, reaching for the boss whistle hanging from Squire's neck, intent on taking it and giving it another thug (<i>seize Squire's authority, strong hit; definite hold, less harm, inflict terrible harm</i>).  He swings at her and she cuts his arm off at the elbow (3 harm machete +1 for terrible harm - 1 armor).  He falls to the ground, howling and bleeding as Montana takes his whistle and gives it to her new second.  <br/><br/>The fights over as Montana absently tells Johnny, the omega of her pack, to "take care of Squire."  She is surprised to hear a gunshot and turns to find Johnny standing over Squire's corpse, years of revenge and a pistol in his shaky hands.  (<i>Montana's player hadn't intended to kill Squire, but as MC it suddenly all came together and felt right</i>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261238/#Comment_261238" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:21:14+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:21AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And some questions:<br/><br/>1) In your interpretation, does a Seize by Force hit always result in Harm going both ways?  In the list of options the player can choose "suffer little harm" and "inflict terrible harm", with the rule "if she doesn't choose to suffer little harm, she suffers the normal amount"- but what is normal?<br/><br/>For example, if a PC hits someone from behind, or from a sniper nest, with no particular chance of getting hurt (not immediately, anyway), would the harm just be one way?  Obviously in some cases it wouldn't be a move at all- it would just happen- but often the opportunity for a miss and consequences is important.<br/><br/>2) If the PCs want to track or find someone, how would you make it a challenge?  Would you just use Acting Under Fire ("the fire is your time running out")?  Craft a custom move? <br/><br/>For example, the PCs are following some cannibals who stole a boy from the holding- time is of the essence as they race into the night.  Alternately, the PCs want to take the fight to some slavers- time isn't really an issue, but the ruins are a dangerous place and the slavers might find them first...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261261/#Comment_261261" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:49:15+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:49AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) According to the text, seize by force happens only when both parties have their weapons out and are ready for the fight. So, yeah, by default each party inflicts their harm on the other (according to their weapons and armor). "The normal amount" just means suffering their harm minus your armor.<br/><br/>Hitting someone from behind or sniping someone aren't moves. The player says what their character does and the MC says what happens as a result (according to his agenda and principles). Of course, if the player says an action during the hitting or sniping that <i>is</i> a move, then you roll it. This is why you don't usually gloss over things like "I get in position for the shot" or "I wait until Dremmer is alone and then hit him from behind." All kinds of moves can come out of stuff like that, if you stay in the moment and get concrete details about what the PC is actually doing.<br/><br/>2) "How would you make it a challenge?" is a question that puts a chill down my MC spine. "Making things a challenge" is not an MC job so, like, don't.<br/><br/>The way you do it is by saying what the MC is supposed to always say (agenda, principles, moves). Tell them what's what, making your move but covering it in fiction, giving them the chance to react:<br/><br/><i>It's goddamn dark. You can smell the muck of the swamps all around, hear the sucking sounds of your boots with every step. There's a very faint light up ahead, kind of orangey. A cigarette? What do you do?<br/><br/>It's goddamn dark. You're just running out there after them? Okay, you're still stumbling around an hour later. You have no idea where you are, but maybe somewhere south of the rag waste? It smells like spilled guts, that's for sure. You hear whispering off to your right. A flashlight clicks on, shines right on you. What do you do?<br/><br/>It's goddamn dark. Do you have any lights? Okay, cool. You can follow the tire tracks in the dirt. They go about a mile north and then right through the fucking skag mounds. Are you going in there or circling around to pick up the tracks on the other side?</i><br/><br/>For the ruins and the slavers, do the same. Announce future badness, and if your plans come together without interference, hit them hard. If your plans are interfered with, cool! Make a move that sets you up for something harder and lets them react. Barf apocalyptica on everything.<br/><br/>One key thing is not glossing over too much. You don't say, "Okay, so you attack the slave compound. Roll 'Seize by force.'" Stay in the moment whenever possible, give them concrete fictional details, ask questions, make your moves to set up future moves and to put plans in motion, ask them what they're doing in the immediate now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261274/#Comment_261274" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T12:08:39+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 12:08PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (addressing the second bit first)<br/><br/>I feel like you're reading too much into "make a challenge."  Whether it's me as an MC or the NPCs or the world itself, the PCs are being presented with challenges, problems to overcome, threats to manage.  It's an MC's job to play those threats and make the moves that ultimately present those hurdles.  Am I wrong?<br/><br/>In any case, there is certainly text in the book saying "whenever a character does something that obviously demands a roll but you don't quite see how to deal with it..." [from the under fire move description].  In my opinion, the action they wanted to take ((racing into the dark to find the cannibals) warranted a roll of some kind, if for no other reason than because it was a tense moment- would they find them?  Would the kid still be alive?  Would they get ambushed?<br/><br/>In this case, they had already read the charged situation and were ready to jump when they found them (going aggro), but I felt like something was missing in between.  I described the scene and barfed my apocalyptica, but effectively I just said "What do you want to do, find them?  Okay you found them.  Now what do you want to do?'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261278/#Comment_261278" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T12:18:14+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 12:18PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Hitting someone from behind or sniping someone aren't moves.

His people have already found them and have the element of surprise- they've scouted the area, determined the best angle of approach (based on a custom move).  Midgett wants to get in position in a high window of a ruined building with an angle on the camp and get a good look at the defenses.  [<i>read charged situation</i>].  When he does, he realizes the place is covered by enemy snipers and he's in danger [<i>'greatest threat' = other snipers</i>].  He wants to take a few of them out, completely and quietly, with his fancy assault rifle before the real attack starts.  He fires at one [<i>seize his life by force; take definite hold, suffer little harm; 4 harm</i>] and kills him.  <br/><br/>So my thinking here was that although the other snipers were armed, he wouldn't take harm from this.  Do you think that action was better suited to Acting Under Fire?   Or would you have just hand-waved that shot and waited for a real move?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261286/#Comment_261286" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T12:31:36+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 12:31PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 12:40PM by lumpley.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, cool!<br/><br/>Like John says, if they can't fight back, it's not seizing by force.

[looks up 3-harm to an NPC] He falls down, tries feebly to cover his head, stops moving.<br/><br/><i>...or else...</i><br/>Sniper: 3-harm. I got a 7-9.<br/>MC: Cool.

Shooting, taking up a new position without being seen, shooting again, like in that Jude Law, Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz flick.<br/><br/>If Midgett inflicts terrible harm, that's 4-harm, which counts as 3-harm when it's one vs a small gang. When you inflict 3-harm on a gang, it's "widespread injuries, many serious, several fatalities." If the snipers are armored, reduce that to "many injuries, several serious, a few fatalities," which is still not bad for one guy. Taking definite hold would neutralize the snipers as a threat anyway, which I expect is his primary goal. He would suffer harm in return, which would mean that at least one of them managed to locate him and return fire. That'd be 2-harm (maaaybe 3-harm) +1harm for the size difference, -1harm if he suffers little harm, before armor - at a guess, he'll wind up suffering 1-harm - some kind of ricochet or deep graze, is all, since PCs get the first bullet free.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261303/#Comment_261303" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T13:06:23+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  1:06PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 1:23PM by lumpley.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason:<br/><br/>What divides going aggro from seizing by force is whether your enemy is fighting back. If your enemy is fighting back, you don't get to go aggro, but must instead seize by force.<br/><br/>No, he hasn't definitely, positively suffered 3-harm. The sniper went aggro, got the 7-9 instead of the 10+, and so didn't necessarily get everything she hoped for. AT LEAST she got the guy down behind the burnt-out car; if that's not good enough for her, she has the initiative [not a technical term] and can follow through however she thinks best. (There are, of course, lots of situations where it would be good enough for her, where that result is just as useful to her as the kill would have been.)<br/><br/>Going aggro is the better move for just killin'. On a 10+, you just kill them, and they don't get to shoot back!

This is the sort of decision that makes 7-9 feel often like failure to me. I think it would be less aggravating if I chose the miserable outcome instead of the GM, as you do in other cases like seize by force.<br/><br/>It's clear that the way Midgett is optimized (he's a one-man gang, he does +1 harm, he can elect to make his gun do +1 additional harm, has ap ammo, he's +3 hard) that he should have just taken on the entire enemy sniper corps at once and seized by force. <br/><br/>One thing we buck up against is granularity - I want to get shit done in one swoop, because failure (and partial success) is so common and painful, and the GM wants to not do that for a variety of good reasons. So in this case I'd be like "I want the snipers suppressed, let's roll" (in fact I believe I did say that) and Steve toned that down to something more specific, like Midgett killing a guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261321/#Comment_261321" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T13:40:42+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  1:40PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 1:45PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We haven't yet rolled going aggro when it's a clear case of one character just shooting another.

Like, you set up this really cool situation or the players want to do this cool thing and you want to roll for it, because that's what your gut says you should do, that's what a challenge IS!, and the players look at their move sheets (or, really, you look at your players' move sheet) and can't figure out what move to make.  But, as with "say Yes or roll the dice," your instincts honed from other games may be throwing you off here. There are no conflicts in AW. There are only moves. There is nothing about a situation that necessarily demands that you have to make a move.<br/><br/>You know how, when you're playing Dogs for the first time, someone wants to climb a mesa and wants to know if they should roll Body?  It's a bit like that.  Unless the demons really don't want you to climb the mesa, it's not a conflict and you don't roll dice for it.  You say Yes and move on.<br/><br/>Our SG senses are honed to look for and create conflicts, because conflicts are those situations in which you roll dice. That's totally not how AW works. There are no conflicts. None. You don't create interesting situations in which the players are forced to (or get to) roll the dice. That's not how it works. Instead, the MC makes their moves, spews apocalyptica, looks through crosshairs, etc. And, concurrently, the players make their moves and play their characters. There are no inherent move-making situations in the form of "conflicts" in other games; you can always get through a scene or situation without making moves, if none of them seem appropriate or you decide not to make any moves.<br/><br/>Sure, interesting situations are opportunities for the players to make moves, but they have to choose to make actual moves. If they just want to shoot some guy in the head, that may not be a move. Not everything interesting and valuable is or requires a move! Remember that you can do stuff in the fiction that matters! Just by doing it!<br/><br/>Hope that helps.

Not everything interesting and valuable is or requires a move!<br/></blockquote>\nOkay, this bit has become clearer to me over time, and through reading about the experiences you guys have had with the game.  In fact, at the end of our one-shot, we had a great scene that arose out of my dawning understanding of this.  Our Operator was sneaking through a ruined building in the same fire-fight described above, trying to avoid hi-tech perimeter alarms and booby-traps to get to the snipers hiding on the upper floors.  My initial instincts were that he would need to make a series of actions and/or moves, but we started with Acting Under Fire to sneak through unharmed and undetected.<br/><br/>He rolled and got a weak hit, calling for opportunities and complications.  I suggested that he could see the sniper, and could go ahead and attack (leading to a straight-up fight) or he could wait a moment as the sniper repositioned.  If he waited, he'd have the drop on the guy, but the downside would be that the sniper would have time to drop a grenade on some NPCs friends down below.  He decided to wait, creating a great moment for other players watching the drama unfold, and then he killed the sniper (no move, no rolls).<br/><br/>So I can see what you guys are saying- just killing that guy wasn't move-worthy- it was just part of the fiction unfolding.  That makes a lot of sense <i>that is entirely not clear to me from the text</i>.  But I like it.<br/><br/>Now this part:\n<blockquote>There are no conflicts in AW. There are only moves. There is nothing about a situation that necessarily demands that you have to make a move.<br/>...<br/>There are no conflicts. None. You don't create interesting situations in which the players are forced to (or get to) roll the dice. That's not how it works. Instead, the MC makes their moves, spews apocalyptica, looks through crosshairs, etc. And, concurrently, the players make their moves and play their characters. </blockquote>\nThis is crazy-talk to me.  To say there are no conflicts (little-C conflicts, no special jargon intended) doesn't make sense to me.  There was a conflict above when I presented the complications of his weak hit- reveal yourself and have a fight, or get the drop on him at the expense of others' lives.  That's a conflict that I present (arbitrarily, but based on the results of his move) to which the player must respond.  He doesn't have to respond with a move, but it is a decision point, and there are conflicting interests at play.  <br/><br/>Likewise, if I'm playing my NPCs (Threat - Warlord: slaver) and I have them seize a hostage (capture someone) that the PCs care about, there is a conflict- do they act to save that person?  What would they do or sacrifice for them? Or do they just ignore the problem and walk away?  Again, it's a conflict that I present in the course of making my moves, playing my NPCs, etc., and it's up to the players to decide how to act.  Maybe that response comes as move or maybe not.\n<blockquote>Sure, interesting situations are opportunities for the players to make moves, but they have to choose to make actual moves.</blockquote>\nThis brings up a different issue that I noticed in our game, which may be important.  It seems like there's a bit of conflicted signals for the players in the way the rules are structured.  On the one hand, they should just do what they want to do, not thinking about rolls or moves when they do it.  Don't say "I want to shoot that guy, what move is that?" but rather describe what you want to do and see if a move or roll is required- sound right?<br/><br/>On the other hand, players have highlighted stats that are tied to improvement, so mechanically they have a vested interest in A) making moves whenever they can and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> choosing actions that will map to a move that uses the stat that they have highlighted.  So if the Gunlugger player looks at his sheet and sees that Hard is highlighted, he knows that he wants to either go aggro or seize something.  He starts actively looking for the right moment to use those moves and (at least from this purely mechanical perspective) might be frustrated if he can't find a situation where actually doing that move is required.  While one could argue that the application of a move is clearly prescribed in the text, there is obviously lots of room for interpretation, as we can see above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261427/#Comment_261427" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T09:28:32+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  9:28AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2010 9:28AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>So I can see what you guys are saying- just killing that guy wasn't move-worthy- it was just part of the fiction unfolding</blockquote>\nWorth noting, in this instance, that the NPC below the sniper was a guy that was marked for death, according to our battlebabe's earlier vision, an NPC we'd rescued from cannibals and liked.

While one could argue that the application of a move is clearly prescribed in the text, there is obviously lots of room for interpretation, as we can see above.<br/><br/>I believe the correct thing form a player approach here is just to slap your hand down on the table and say "I go aggro on that sucker." It's the GM's job to ask them how they do that. There's no dicta against the player just doing a particular move by name, nor is it problematic to try and maneuver yourself into a situation to do so.<br/><br/>On the other hand, describing fiction actions whilst angling for the GM to identify it as a particular move is a communications breakdown and just adds FUD to the whole process.<br/><br/>Maneuvering to use your best moves can be a driver to the game and to the fiction. The best example I can think of is how my skinner's always trying to make every situation about sexuality and will. For example, in our recent game Buffy, God's Slayer, was fixing to have a violent faceoff with Kyrami, God's ex-girlfriend. Now the fiction made it clear that Tristan, my character, could impress Buffy by proving himself a worthy combat opponent. Instead, Tristan opted to maneuver the situation so he could use his skinner wiles on both angels. This involved him actively helping Buffy hunt Kyranmi down, then bugging out and leaving both in the lurch afterwards. Tristan is a selfish little mother sometimes.<br/><br/>Now my maneuvering could just as easily have resulted in my character getting drawn into an un-advantageous aggro situation (like when Buffy puts a gun to my head and tells me to stop using my skinner witchery on her). Life in Apocalypse World sucks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261478/#Comment_261478" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T13:45:35+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  1:45PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, Tony's right. There are two ways to do moves:<br/><br/>1) You say what your guy does, and the GM says, "So, you're going aggro..."<br/>2) You say "I'm going aggro on his ass," and the GM says, "Cool, how?"<br/><br/>(MC book, p. 5)<br/><br/>Both are good. My favorite is:<br/><br/>"I open my brain to the psychic maelstrom."<br/>"Okay, cool. How?"<br/>"Uh... good question...."<br/><br/>Steve, you're totally right about there being conflicts in AW. They emerge out of the collision of fictional stuff (as prompted by PC-NPC-PC triangles and Fronts) in the same way conflicts emerge out of D&amp;D play. They don't get bracketed, highlighted, and served up for resolution the way they do in, say, PTA or Dust Devils, though. I think that's what Jonathan was saying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261517/#Comment_261517" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T18:20:14+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  6:20PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About moves: most importantly, it's not a guessing game. There are untold possible interactions, like this one for example --<br/><br/>"I go aggro!"<br/>"Cool, what do you do?"<br/>"Uh... I dunno, give me a hand?"<br/>"Sure! Do you want to, like, draw your knife on him, or are you going for the more implicit threat?"<br/>"Implicit threat. How about I glare at him?"<br/>"Well... that's pretty weak, I mean if he forces your hand, what's he going to suck up?"<br/>"How about I glare at him <i>and smile like this</i>?"<br/>Both understand that this particular smile means the knife.<br/>"Perfect! Roll."<br/><br/>-- and what's crucial about all of them is that both people draw the connection between the character's action and the move, before either is settled.<br/><br/>This is all p5 of the playtest doc. Notice especially, though, the paragraph about the player revising her character's action. It works both ways - if the player wants to make a move, she gets to keep talking, revising and revising her character's action, until she hits it just the way she wants to.<br/><br/>For more about conflict, see the intro to the battle section, starting with the last paragraph on p97 and carrying on through just the first couple of paragraphs on p98.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261539/#Comment_261539" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T22:50:50+00:00" title="March 11, 2010 10:50PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2010 10:52PM by J_Walton.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, when I said "no conflicts," I meant partially that:<br/><br/>1) there's no conflict resolution; so<br/>2) if you "drive towards conflict" like you do in other games, weird shit can happen.<br/><br/>Like, you know how in most indie games, you're in a scene and you're playing your characters and what not, and a decent little amount of time has gone by, so you start to anticipate where the conflict is going to come from in this scene, like <i>what is this scene actually about?</i>  And then you drive towards it and, when you reach it, then you know to pick up the dice and engage the mechanics?<br/><br/>THAT's one process that AW doesn't have. There's no point when you're like, "Oh, this is a conflict. That means we do X."  There are some places where you're like, "Oh, I guess I'm making a move, yeah?" or like, "Oh, I guess I had sex. Time to remember what my sex move does."<br/><br/>You also can't drive towards conflict by hard-framing right into the action, in media res-style.  Like, holy shit, I'm gonna to cut right to where John's in a fire-fight and I know for sure that he's gonna pick up his dice and Act Under Fire and then SHIT WILL GO DOWN.  Because maybe he won't do that at all.  Maybe John's playing a Skinner and he takes off his clothes and the firefight just stops fucking dead while everyone stares. Then John grabs the nearest gunman and snaps his neck.  And no rolling is required for any of this.  There isn't really even a conflict.<br/><br/>I guess, in my mind, conflicts are different than "moments of choice."  Conflicts are where you try to accomplish or achieve something and someone is resisting that achievement.  But there are no opposed rolls in AW, right?  Basically you take turns acting independently.  I mean, yes, you can definitely have conflicts in the literary sense.  But I wasn't talking about the literary sense.  I was talking about the game sense.  Maybe AW does have conflicts in the game sense, but I don't remember seeing it happen yet.<br/><br/>Does that seem less like crazy-talk?<br/><br/>P.S. John / Tony / Vincent said everything I would say about choosing which moves to make. Yes, you often just stumble onto moves by following the fiction, but you can also declare moves explicitly if you really want to pursue things in a mechanical fashion, which can also be very effective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
