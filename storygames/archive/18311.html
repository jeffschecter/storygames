I posted my advice on my blog but I was also asked to post it here since this is a comfortable place for people to converse publicly and communicate ideas. Transcribed with links intact:<br/><br/>I've written a few playbooks now, and I've looked through a lot of really promising builds for playbooks and some that are just atrocious. Having scoured the Barf Forth Apocalyptica forums and committed to memory many of the random details from Vincent about how he wrote the original 11 playbooks, I feel pretty confident in writing this step by step process for writing a playbook.<br/><br/><b>Step 1: Have an open-ended concept</b><br/>This is key. Your concept is everything, it helps define what you're going to write about the playbook. But you can't cling to it like a bible. Your vision of the archetype can't be constrained and must be open to interpretation. The best playbooks have a concept which is clearly understood and open to enough interpretation that it doesn't force the character to behave a certain way. The archetype molds to the character, not the other way around.<br/>Look at the core playbooks and you can see the archetypes clearly: the Brainer is <i>a weird psychic</i>, the Angel is <i>a competent medic</i>, the Driver is <i>a car obsessive</i>, etc.<br/><br/><b>Step 2: Balance isn't everything</b><br/>Every playbook has a stat block that usually includes a "best" stat. In almost every instance, the stat blocks add up to a total of +3 (+2 +1 -1 +1 +0 = +3). In some instances a character starts with two stats at +2 and those break the mold, but those stat lines also have a consistent math of adding up to +2 (+2 +2 +0 -1 -1 = +2), the price you pay for starting with two +2s is one less beneficial point. <br/>Also, every playbook should start with three moves, or things, that make it distinct. These don't need to be balanced in power with other playbooks, as long as the character simply has 3 things. Look at the core playbooks and they all have three things to start: the Gunlugger starts with a choice of 3 moves, the Driver has their car (1) the <b><i>no shit driver</i></b> move (2) and then a choice of a second move (3), and the Savvyhead has their workspace (1) and a choice of 2 more moves (2 and 3).<br/>Again, there are some playbooks that break the mold, but these tend to be balanced within themselves:<br/>the Battlebabe only chooses 2 moves to start, but they have a Cool +3 and that's their third <i>thing</i><br/>the Hardholder only has their hold and a gang, with moves that accompany each, however these are bigger than the holds and gangs other playbooks can get as improvements, plus the Hardholder explicitly never needs to spend money for food and lodging<br/>the Operator gets gigs and moonlighting, plus one more move, but the Operator's gigs outnumber what other characters can get as improvements<br/><br/><b>Step 3: Scarcity is the name of the game</b><br/>One of the key things when writing moves and improvements for your playbook is to remember the theme of scarcity. In other words, you can't get all of the options! Nothing is perfect in Apocalypse World and you're always left wanting a little more, this should apply to character improvement as well. If your playbook has 5 moves to choose from and you can choose 3 during character creation, then you should think about adding a 6th move, maybe even a 7th move, or limiting the "get a new playbook move" improvement so that there's one move you can't get.<br/>Again, look at the examples with the core game:<br/>the Skinner starts with 2 moves and can get 2 more through improvements, but there are 5 Skinner moves total<br/>the Gunlugger starts with 3 moves and can get 2 more through improvements, but there are 7 Gunlugger moves total<br/><br/><b>Step 4: Peer review</b><br/>Share your ideas with your gaming friends and ask them for criticism. Share your ideas in the forums and ask for criticism. There is no better resource for criticism than a gaming community, just remember to not let <b><i>all</i></b> criticism affect your work. When I first shared <a href="http://nerdwerds.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-wolf.html" rel="nofollow">the Wolf</a> some people noted the villainous nature of the archetype and said they didn't think it fit with the game, I ignored that criticism because <b>FUCK YOU!</b> Don't tell me how to play the game! Just because it wouldn't be fun for you or your group doesn't mean it won't be fun for me and mine. Those kinds of criticisms about the theme and tone of your work are useless. In a way, they are just an outsider reaction similar to <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2013/02/trust-in-me.html" rel="nofollow">that lack of trust one displays at the gaming table when somebody else is narrating the action</a>.<br/>But when somebody says "Hey, it looks like your math is wrong." or "Isn't this move just a weaker version of going aggro?" Those are valid. Listen to them. <br/>Scratch that! Listen to everybody. Just keep your bullshit detector on a high frequency.<br/>And don't wait until your playbook is finished to share it either. As soon as you have something to work with you should be talking about it and sharing it to see where the cracks are. Poke and prod at your work until you think it's solid.<br/><br/><b>Step 5: Play it!</b><br/>Once you think your work is solid, you have got to play it. Get other people to play it if you can. Play it, play it, and play it some more. Because you will never have played it enough and somebody might still find something wrong with it.<br/><br/>That's all I've got. Good luck!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412831/#Comment_412831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T21:07:04+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  9:07PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have lots to say later, but for now I want to share a tiny tidbit that Vincent mentioned long, long ago.<br/><br/>He said you can tell who the main love interest or protagonist or something is in 19th century romance novels or something because their hands are described.

Just to reiterate some of the details:<br/>- A second +2 stat gives you a 1 point penalty (or counts as +3, either way).<br/>- The Battlebabe's cool+3 is just a hidden +1 cool move.<br/>- One of the Operator's stat lines is wrong and adds up to only +2.<br/>- The Quarantine's strange roll-for-weird thing counts as weird-1 in the math.<br/>- And also the Driver's stats only add up to +2 instead of +3 because he gets a thing that boosts his stats. If you have a thing that boosts your stats you will be more inclined to use it if you have low stats. And it is a good thing for the Driver to be more inclined to use his car.<br/><br/>How I break down the moves+stuff of the playbooks in order to judge them is this:<br/>After stats, each playbook gets 3 moves or move-like things and some colour.<br/>- Angel: 2 moves + angel kit.<br/>- Battlebabe gets 2 moves and a +1 cool (for +3 total). Custom weapons are just colour, they're not actually better, they're just custom.<br/>- Brainer gets 2 pieces of gear for a third move. This gear is not always as good as a third move, but if you consider how impactful the Brainer's moves are on the game, it is okay for this "third move" to be less good than the first two. Also the Brainer starts with a shitload of money.<br/>- Chopper's gang counts as half a move and I guess the bikes count for another half. Or maybe the gang counts for a full move, plus Pack alpha being a full move, even though you can get both for one improvement (but only if your playbook lets you, so...) but that would mean a holding counts for nothing.<br/>- Driver: car + no shit driver + 1 move, pus there's the stat penalty.<br/>- Gunlugger: 3 moves. All those weapons is just colour. Easy come, easy go.<br/>- Hardholder's gang and holding count for a half each. As nerdwerds notes, both of these are better than what you get from an advance where you get the moves and the people with it.<br/>- Hocus' followers don't count as a move, it's enough that Fortunes does. They are just not as good as a holding.<br/>- Operator's gigs count as a move even though Moonlighting also does. She still get more gigs than other characters that take this advance, plus a crew to work them, but she can still look a little drab at times, if that first moonlighting roll doesn't put her in the "main character" seat from the very beginning.<br/>- Savvyhead's workspace counts as 1.<br/>- And the Skinner's special gear counts as 1. If you check her moves, they are even more impactful, invasive, and spotlight-hogging than the Brainer's, so it is probably good she only gets 2. That gear is also stuff that nobody else gets at all (and even has a +1 stat option!)<br/><br/>- Maestro D's establishment counts as 1.<br/>- Hoarder's hoard counts as 1.<br/>- But the Quarantine's stasis facility doesn't. It's colour. Probably because it can be abandoned or destroyed without remorse. It's not essential to his concept, more of an opportunity you are encouraged to explore.<br/>- Likewise, the Touchstone's token of hope is just colour, even though it has some mechanical benefits. Touchstone's a bit munchkin-y anyway though.<br/>- And the mask of the Faceless is also colour, but it's actually a weakness! Because all his moves are awesome fighty moves, this actually adds some depth and dimension to the character, which is good.<br/>- The Solace has two moves plus Threshold. Wolves is just colour.<br/><br/>Makes sense right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412872/#Comment_412872" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T10:41:57+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 10:41AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2013 10:43AM by Johnstone.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, now let's talk about something that doesn't get discussed a lot. This is a giant long post but I promise it will be worth it.<br/><br/>Notice something most of those playbooks above have in common? <b>Almost all of them have a resource</b>, a thing that isn't part of them but is part of their concept. These are not just D&amp;D-style murderhobo classes that are all about what kind of special actions you can take and what you can do TO others. They are often about who you know and what you can do FOR others, or what you can get out of them when you're not killing them to take their treasure.<br/><br/>Angel kit, workspace, car, holding, gang, followers, hoard, mask, establishment, even gigs. These things are all resources that the characters rely on, are responsible for, and must manage properly. Most people, when they write new playbooks, write murderhobo archetypes like the Battlebabe, the Gunlugger, and the Faceless. They are people with no real ties to the communities around them and no real baggage they have to tend to, just getting by on their raw ability. This is understandable, because that is what most character classes and concepts in most rpgs are and have always been. And it's fine for characters who wander the earth like Caine in Kung Fu but AW characters are best played where they live.<br/><br/>There is another axis to this resource thing though, that seems to be less obvious, and that is <b>what each playbook brings to the table and what it demands</b>. For the most part, the 11 basic playbooks are those that add something to the setting. They contribute. By contrast, most of the limited edition playbooks are very selfish and instead make demands of the game.<br/><br/>Take the following for example: Chopper, Hardholder, and Hocus. The simple act of picking one of these actively contributes to the game's setting. They introduce people and community that aren't monopolized by any one player. Anyone can live in the Hardholder's holding and interact with her people. Anyone can be in the Hocus's cult or interact with them. If you join the Chopper's gang, you even get a free bike! Plus, now you know what kind of people live in your Apocalypse World, or some of them.<br/><br/>Now look at the Angel, Brainer, Driver, Savvyhead, and Skinner. Each of them has a resource that makes them, fundamentally, reliant providing services for other people. They need to actually interact with other characters because they don't have the capability to just take whatever they want, so their resources connect them to the setting and the communities in it. Angel heals, Savvyhead fixes, Driver drives people and things around, the Skinner has her art, and the Brainer reads minds for probably whoever has the most moolah. Each requires transactions of some kind.<br/><br/>The Operator is kinda in-between these two types, because the MC has to ask her who the people involved in all these gigs are, which results in setting for everyone, not just the Operator. But she's not automatically in charge of them, she still has to buy, sell, and negotiate every new deal.<br/><br/>And finally\u2014and on the other hand\u2014we have the murderhobos the Battlebabe and the Gunlugger. These playbooks, in and of themselves, do NOT actively contribute something to the setting (other than a sense of theme and genre). They give the player some cool shit to do, and make motions toward encouraging them to be social, but there's nothing there that demands non-sociopathic relationships with other people or gives the MC free stuff. They are, however, thematically appropriate for the post-apocalyptic genre and seriously, there's only two of them!<br/><br/>Until you start adding the limited edition playbooks. Then you get a third murderhobo in the Faceless (who is basically a weirder version of the Gunlugger), plus many more made by not-Vincents.<br/><br/>The other limited edition playbooks are resource-based, though, right? Surely they add something to the game? There is a problem though, because these are <b>resources that monopolize the game's attention</b>, which can be even worse than murderhobos!<br/><br/>For example, if the Faceless can talk to his mask, this playbook is adding an NPC to the game that only one player can interact with. The Hoarder's hoard is even worse in this regard. An NPC that only one character can interact with takes up a lot of the MC's attention. If this comes with rules and stuff too, it can become really distracting. Anyway, I've criticized the Hoarder before, around the end of <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2754.0" rel="nofollow">this AP thread</a>. In that one instance, I found it really disruptive to MC for the Hoarder when the hoard wasn't central to the fiction and was just a thing for that one PC (and the other PCs had their own secret bases). Take a look at my Damned playbook for comparison. It uses almost the same rules but allows the player to manage them, so that all the MC needs to do is listen to what the player says about their stuff and then be an MC. She doesn't have to also manage that character's hold and private NPC.<br/><br/>As for the others:<br/><br/>The Maestro D' has a resource much like a holding, followers, or a gang. Except that, to interact with it, you have to go <i>there</i>. You have to <i>go to the Maestro D'</i> in order to get the stuff that this playbook contributes to the game. It doesn't come to you, even if she does.<br/><br/>The Quarantine demands the game become about what caused the apocalypse. <i>Every session</i>, somebody (and it's likely the MC) has to make up some stuff about the apocalypse, so the MC had better be thinking about it! Plus there's that stasis chamber demanding the MC's attention too.<br/><br/>The point here is that these are okay or even awesome to play IF the whole group wants them there. If everybody wants to know what is up with this guy's mask, if they want to know what he has in his secret stash of stuff, if they all want to go to her club, if they all want to know what caused the apocalypse, cool! Pick that playbook! But if these resources don't become a main, central point of the game, they become dead weight. If the other players don't care that much, it's going to fall flat and take up space. And if you have too many selfish resources, they're not going to get along very well. It takes a lot of work to get a Maestro D', a Quarantine, and a Hoarder to work together in the same game, because they all have their own lairs. Whereas you put a Hardholder, a Hocus, and an Operator together and your setting builds itself.<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>The Touchstone and the Solace are also demanding because they present particular visions of the post-apocalypse and then coerce the other players into going along with them. The Solace does a better job because it's mostly all rewards and no threats of ass-kicking, but she still demands the game be all about her deal.<br/><br/>What the Solace has in common with the Chopper, Hardholder, and Hocus, though, is that it's not just about what cool things the playbook gives to the player who picks it. These playbooks are also all about what they give ALL the players when someone picks them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412879/#Comment_412879" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T12:08:12+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 12:08PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A little more on the Murderhobos:<br/><br/>This aspect of contributing to the campaign as well as the one player's enjoyment can also apply to murderhobo playbooks and those with smaller resources to manage. As mentioned above, the Battlebabe and the Gunlugger are both thematically appropriate and reinforce the violent, lawless, and terrifying post-apocalyptic feel of the game, so they're not total dead weight. Likewise, the Skinner emphasizes how ugly and broken the world is by being the only really beautiful thing in it and the Brainer tells you right away that there's weird psychic shit beyond even the maelstrom.<br/><br/>This is also something that can be ported over to AW hacks, and Dungeon World in particular, because the classes in DW are all mostly murderhobos. Pretty much all the new classes I've seen so far have been focused on giving the one player a box of shiny new toys, on the principle that players who do cool things make for a cool game. Which is not too bad as far as ideas go, but that weird sort-of disconnect you get when a game is basically everybody taking turns telling their own character's story, with maybe some inter-character references or interaction but not much, only works for short-term games. For long-term play, you want everybody <i>in the game together</i>, right? So, for example, my new classes for Adventures on Dungeon Planet are all about adding that science fantasy flavour to the campaign, in addition to giving players cool things, and the forthcoming Inverse World has its own specific campaign setting which the new classes are tailored for.<br/><br/>So anyway, this is one of the harder parts of game designing playbooks and classes, partly because it's not immediately obvious from a lot of perspectives, and particularly not from an individual player's perspective. And that's why I am writing it all down here.<br/><br/>There's also probably a bunch that could be said for synergy between playbooks, how certain playbooks interact with each other and how you design for that.

In Apocalypse World, violence is a resource, and the gunlugger and the battlebabe provide violence for people who need it. Since the gunlugger has terrible hot and usually mediocre cool, they usually can't fend for themselves without some help, but they have to pay for that help, and they're easily handled. In a game with the gunlugger, part of the challenge is "controlling the gunlugger." I generally agree that the battlebabe is deliberately independent. The movie Yojimbo is a good example of what battlebabes do every day. (I would probably call the driver the second most independent playbook.)<br/><br/>Here's something I would pose as a partly concurring, partly dissenting analysis:<br/><br/>Some of the playbooks define places. The Hardholder and the Maestro'D especially, but also the Savvyhead, the Hoarder, and the Quarantine. If you have one place in the game, most of the action is probably going to take place at or near that place, and an important part of a character's definition will be their relationship to that place -- do they work for the hardholder or are they hunted by them? Do they have a VIP pass at the Maestro's place or do they have to sneak in? If you have multiple places, you're going to have tension between them, and more than likely extended conflict between them for the attention of the other PCs. If you have no places, the MC might have to contribute a little extra to define location, or the players might feel rootless.<br/><br/>Some of the playbooks define groups of people. The Chopper, the Hocus, and the Operator especially, but also potentially the Angel and the Savvyhead, and the Maestro'D and Hardholder both come with groups to protect their places. If you have one group in the game, all the PCs and NPCs will be defined by their relationship to that group -- are they part of it, or do they work with it, or do they fear it, or do they fight it? If you have multiple groups, a big part of the game will almost certainly involve managing their relationships with each other, whether that means keeping them from fighting or making them fight. If you have no groups of people, again, the MC will have to figure out for themselves what the PCs community looks like, or they might feel isolated.<br/><br/>When you're writing a playbook, strongly consider whether it's defining a place or a group of people, or neither, or both. Note that the Hardholder and Maestro'D both pay for getting both a place and a group -- the Hardholder gets very little besides the responsibility to manage them, and the Maestro'D's stuff is very small and vulnerable. At the same time, note that a character with neither a place or a group needs something to contribute to those places and groups, or they're going to have difficulty fitting into the conflicts that are probably inherent in the setup.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is about dependency. What is your playbook dependent on? Why are other people dependent on your playbook?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412894/#Comment_412894" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T15:15:11+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  3:15PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh-oh! Disagreement! Controversy!<br/><br/>People and places, sure, that's a way to look at it. I'd say AW is about intimacy, which includes dependency but is not limited to it.<br/><br/>I'm not buying violence as a resource on par with the other playbooks, though. Yes, it's an <i>option</i> (also an option everyone kinda has), and not the easiest one to go with, either. The easiest answers to the questions "who do you commit violence on behalf of," "who do you commit violence against," and "where do you get the tools to commit violence" are always "me," "anyone who fucks with me," and "I take them from anyone who fucks with me." The <i>baseline</i> is zero contribution.<br/><br/>Keep in mind I'm not talking at all about what the player brings to the table, just the playbook. A good player, and a team player, can make any playbook shine. But the content of the playbook, unless it's ignored, is what comes to the table when anyone plays it. The guy playing the Man With No Name playbook might be an awesome player, but what did the Man With No Name playbook actually contribute to Yojimbo? Nothing, he's a murderhobo. The MC did all the work.<br/><br/>Some other things, and possibly I'm not understanding your points with these:<br/>- In play, I haven't seen the "controlling the gunlugger" thing, so I'm not sure what you mean.<br/>- I don't see how having a low hot makes a character more dependent on people. Instead, it gives them more incentive to use violence to get what they want. Whereas the Battlebabe with the high hot is more likely to seek out social interactions with NPCs (which isn't the same as the playbook contributing NPCs, but gives more opportunity for the MC to ask the player for details about relationships and incentive to the player to answer them).<br/>- And I find the idea that the Driver is more independent than the Gunlugger baffling, to be honest.

Needs are about dependency, because fundamentally, Apocalypse World is not a forgiving place.\n<blockquote>The easiest answers to the questions "who do you commit violence on behalf of," "who do you commit violence against," and "where do you get the tools to commit violence" are always "me," "anyone who fucks with me," and "I take them from anyone who fucks with me."

In Apocalypse World there really isn't enough food, water, shelter, and ammunition lying around, so one of the basic challenges, to my mind, should be just coming up with sustainable strategies to get that stuff. That's where community becomes necessary.\n<blockquote>Some other things, and possibly I'm not understanding your points with these:<br/>- In play, I haven't seen the "controlling the gunlugger" thing, so I'm not sure what you mean.</blockquote>\nGive the gunlugger a bribe, they have to act under fire to not do what you want. By default, gunluggers aren't great at that. More generally, as noted, without social skills or the ability to easily endure difficult circumstances, gunluggers benefit more than most from having a boss to handle problems that aren't easily resolved with bullets. It's not accidental that one whole list of gunlugger names is just names you give dogs!\n<blockquote>- I don't see how having a low hot makes a character more dependent on people. Instead, it gives them more incentive to use violence to get what they want.</blockquote>\nAgain, this is why it's important to include situations where that's not an effective strategy. The biggest reason "murderhobos" get away with their behavior in D&amp;D is that they have a whole social infrastructure to fall back on that will happily feed and house them in their downtime without worrying about their psychopathic tendencies. That doesn't exist in Apocalypse World unless you provide it. If the Gunlugger gets all his food by shooting people and taking their food, pretty soon there aren't going to be any people or any food in the neighborhood.\n<blockquote>- And I find the idea that the Driver is more independent than the Gunlugger baffling, to be honest. Does the MC just never touch the car or something?</blockquote>\nDoes the MC never touch the guns? The Driver and the Chopper are the only two playbooks that definitionally have the tools to get away from whatever's going on, and the Chopper still has to worry about their gang. The Driver can answer all kinds of challenges by saying "I go somewhere else where things are different." The Gunlugger doesn't have that luxury.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412914/#Comment_412914" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T18:11:30+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  6:11PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See <i>now</i> I have to disagree that we're even talking about the same thing.<br/><br/>You're talking about techniques for MCing the game. Which I basically agree with. But that's not the same as techniques for designing playbooks. Like, absolutely that's a pushover MC. And? So? The baseline that the playbook contributes to the setting is still zero. Which, I should be clear, isn't a terrible thing per se, just like playbooks that demand more attention, if you mix the playbooks together right. And some mix better than others. A little bit of "well, that's on the MC to make it work" is fine, especially if the playbook is generous in other aspects, but the more of it you get, the harder the MC's job becomes.\n<blockquote>Does the MC never touch the guns?

But again, we're talking about different things, so I should clarify. You're talking about the tools a playbook gives you to respond to a challenge when it's already on the table, which is something I haven't touched at all yet (though it's a good topic if you've got more to say on it). I'm talking about the links to (or independence from) the setting, out of which challenges and other interactions arise, that are inherent to a playbook. What does the playbook give you that challenges/interactions/drama can come out of? What does the playbook give you that you have to keep track of separately or exclusively? I'm still just tooling around in that area right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412918/#Comment_412918" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T19:18:57+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  7:18PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since we're going afield from AW, I'll drop some knowledge about Monsterhearts playbooks:<br/><br/>DON'T MAKE MORE PLAYBOOKS.<br/><br/>Just kidding, you can if you want, buuuuuuuut.  One of the nice things about Monsterhearts is that maybe the exact kind of person you want to be isn't an option.  This makes choosing and creating a character <i>exactly</i> like being in high school.  You can't be exactly what you want to be.  If you really want vampires to be a particular way but the Vampire playbook won't let you, harness that by making a character who wants to be some way and can't, just can't do it.<br/><br/>Indeed, if you have three players and have never played Monsterhearts before, hand them the Mortal, the Vampire and the Werewolf and pretend the rest don't exist.  This is a major inoculation against wanting more playbooks.<br/><br/>The central engine in Monsterhearts is not the custom moves - it's the basic moves, the moves everyone forgets to talk about.  The basic moves are how the game really works. Custom moves are very good icing on a delicious cake, but that's all they are.  If you have a character and you're custom moving it up all the time, you made a bad playbook.  Virtually none of the existing Monsterhearts playbooks go straight to their custom moves all the time.  (If they do, they quickly become an antagonist.)<br/><br/>Anyway, the best Monsterhearts custom moves affect the string economy in some way - either consuming or creating strings for different effects.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412935/#Comment_412935" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T01:42:32+00:00" title="April 28, 2013  1:42AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2013 1:44AM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, I'm with you JD, I don't think either MH or AW needs more playbooks.

You have generally positive things to say about the core playbooks but heap scorn and criticism on the limited edition playbooks. I think the view is one-sided because many of your criticisms could equally apply to the core 11 playbooks.\n<blockquote>Take the following for example: <b>Chopper</b>, <b>Hardholder</b>, and <b>Hocus</b>. The simple act of picking one of these actively contributes to the game's setting. They introduce people and community that aren't monopolized by any one player. Anyone can live in the <b>Hardholder</b>'s holding and interact with her people. Anyone can be in the <b>Hocus</b>'s cult or interact with them. If you join the <b>Chopper</b>'s gang, you even get a free bike! Plus, now you know what kind of people live in your Apocalypse World, or some of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>As for the others:<br/>The <b>Maestro D'</b> has a resource much like a holding, followers, or a gang. Except that, to interact with it, you have to go <i>there</i>. You have to <i>go to the Maestro D'</i> in order to get the stuff that this playbook contributes to the game. It doesn't come to you, even if she does.<br/>The <b>Quarantine</b> demands the game become about what caused the apocalypse. <i>Every session</i>, somebody (and it's likely the MC) has to make up some stuff about the apocalypse, so the MC had better be thinking about it! Plus there's that stasis chamber demanding the MC's attention too.</blockquote>\nI'm just going to switch the praise-criticism axis on these five that you have here:<br/>1) If somebody's playing a <b>Hardholder</b> than everybody is either forced to live there, or you know you're going to be stuck in the same place because you wouldn't want to split the MC's attention between two communities.<br/>2) If somebody's playing a <b>Hocus</b> then you're stuck dealing with some massive cult and being peer pressured to join, or risk making an enemy out of another player. If that doesn't happen, then good luck trying to steer the attention away from the <b>Hocus</b> player's need to dominate the game with spreading his cult to the other NPCs.<br/>3) If somebody's playing a <b>Chopper </b>then you're stuck being friends with a glorified raider and his gang of criminals and rapists. You're either going to be stuck joining just so you can avoid being knifed, or you're going to constantly be victimized by his gang when the <b>Chopper </b>is off-screen.<br/>4) The <b>Maestro D'</b> gives you a hideout to rest in when the shit is hitting the fan, it can also be used to meet new people or form ties to the community without any of the rigorous hassles or violent consequences of running a hold. You can even become the benefactors of the community by using it as the meeting place to hire violent travelers by offering them jobs to take out local raiding warbands or go out searching for things your Angel and Savvyhead might need (just like all those NPCs in old D&amp;D modules who would hire adventurers to leave town and go get things for them).<br/>5) The <b>Quarantine</b> can release everyone else in the facility from stasis giving your group an entire new community to interact with and become a part of. The immediate effect of suffering from psi-harm means they'll need lots of help which gives every character a chance to make some decent allies. Plus, with all those juicy questions about the past it's easy to link other characters to the Quarantine's personal history by making them descendants of the original people who built the stasis facility.<br/><br/>Interestingly, my first game of AW included a Hocus and a Chopper turned Hardholder, and eventually a Maestro D' and a Quarantine were made as second characters.

Which I basically agree with. But that's not the same as techniques for designing playbooks. Like, absolutely that's a pushover MC. And? So? The baseline that the playbook contributes to the setting is still zero. Which, I should be clear, isn't a terrible thing per se, just like playbooks that demand more attention, if you mix the playbooks together right. And some mix better than others. A little bit of "well, that's on the MC to make it work" is fine, especially if the playbook is generous in other aspects, but the more of it you get, the harder the MC's job becomes.</blockquote>\nWell, I think we're generally in agreement here, then. I got the feeling from your previous posts that you were really against making any more playbooks that don't come with setting attached. I don't really think this is a playbook design problem, I think it's a group balance problem (and thus, basically, an MCing issue). I agree that a group made up of a Battlebabe, a Gunlugger, a Faceless and a Driver is going to make for a tough game to MC because it's basically just a car full of psychos. But I would say that a group made up of a Hardholder, a Maestro'D, a Hocus and a Quarantine is also going to be difficult to MC. There are just too many separate power blocs that are all competing for screen time and power. Somebody is likely to miss out on the stuff they presumably chose the playbook to do. What you want is a balance of setting-defining characters and setting-consuming characters, so that the people who like to get in and mix things up can go interact with the stuff that belongs to the people who like to have established things to manage.<br/><br/>So I guess, in terms of playbook design advice, I'd say that you should probably not tilt too far in one direction or the other, because that'll make it that much more difficult to balance. The Faceless and the Battlebabe are probably on one edge of the acceptable spectrum and the Hardholder and Quarantine probably on the other edge. I haven't seen DW much, but if all the playbooks there are setting consumers, then I'd agree that it would be difficult for me as an MC.<br/><br/>I have to agree that I think you're a being a little harsh on the LE playbooks. I think they go a little further out than the base playbooks -- as you note, the Faceless is about as self-contained as you can get, and I'd say the Quarantine is even more setting-defining than the guys who just come with a place and a gang -- but I really don't think they do anything totally offbase or out of context. For example, to me the Maestro'D is basically a baby Hardholder. Sure, if you stick them in a game with a Hardholder, you'll have to "go to" the Maestro's place, as you describe, but that's because you're living at the holding! That's exactly the kind of place tension I was talking about. If you don't have two place-and-people-owning characters, there's no conflict there, everybody can just spend all their time at the Maestro's.\n<blockquote>Okay, yeah. I get your point now. But again, we're talking about different things, so I should clarify. You're talking about the tools a playbook gives you to respond to a challenge when it's already on the table, which is something I haven't touched at all yet (though it's a good topic if you've got more to say on it). I'm talking about the links to (or independence from) the setting, out of which challenges and other interactions arise, that are inherent to a playbook. What does the playbook give you that challenges/interactions/drama can come out of? What does the playbook give you that you have to keep track of separately or exclusively? I'm still just tooling around in that area right now.</blockquote>\nI guess I was responding to your statement that the non-violent characters are dependent on services to survive, which I don't really agree with. The first prong of my dissent was that violent characters are still rather dependent, and the second that characters like the Driver are actually better equipped to survive alone than the Gunlugger. If the Gunlugger is setting-consuming, which I agree they are, I think the Driver is definitely at least as much so. Arguably more, because the Driver expands the radius of stuff for the MC to worry about by a huge amount, and it's unlikely that other players will have concerned themselves too much with what's a hundred miles away from them, so it's going to be thinly defined.<br/><br/>In terms of responding to challenges, I think this is one of those areas where you should design weakness more than you should design strength. It's easy and fun to make a playbook which can solve every problem with charm/stealth/guns. But we already have the Battlebabe. It's always worth spending time thinking about what your concept's going to just be terrible at, and making sure you deliberately don't patch those holes. Almost all of the playbooks have a few glaring weaknesses to explore and/or work around in play, so make sure yours do too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412961/#Comment_412961" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T11:54:37+00:00" title="April 28, 2013 11:54AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the playbooks drag the game in different directions, I think.

I am definitely NOT saying don't make more playbooks! Definitely you should make more, even the murderhobos. Make more hacks, more games, more playbooks, fuck yeah.<br/><br/>So, yeah, okay, it's true I am being overly critical in some cases, although that's in part to highlight the overall point. Once a playbook is done, has a decent concept, and is mechanically sound, there's still the way it plays at the table with a range of different players, how it reacts to the other playbooks, and what it does for the MC to consider. All that I'm saying in this thread may not even be good advice for someone who wants to take their playbook from crap to good, but if someone wants to go from good to great it at least bears some serious thought (agree with me or not).<br/><br/>My Maestro D' criticism is actually pretty trivial, I'll admit. BUT, think of it this way: The hardhold can do pretty much all the things an establishment can do--it can be a small community inside a larger community or a larger settled/urban space with other communities around it (and I've played that game). Or it can be the whole community that all the PCs live in, in which case it has multiple locations in it, and you are not stuck to any one place when setting a scene inside it. The establishment is one place, a smaller place. Of course, you have the option of choosing a movable establishment, so again I'm exaggerating a little for effect, but if you really compare the two, one has a greater range of options than the other, period. And that is something to seriously consider when making a new playbook that introduces a location. Does it have broad application, like a community or "place where people live," or is it limited to a type of activity, the way an establishment, or a workspace, is? Or is it something that the player really has very little ability to customize, for example the obvious locations that the hypothetical Torturer and Yacht Captain playbooks would introduce?<br/><br/>The first (the Hardholder) should be in the basic list of playbooks, the ones that you should be able to assume you can offer at the beginning of any particular game and have them work well. The third type are playbooks that should go in the special category which tells you to think about it first before you offer them or decide to play one. The second (the Maestro D') I actually think there's room to argue over.<br/><br/>If everybody is excited to see a certain playbook, then of course it doesn't really matter how limited the choice of options are because everybody already wants it there. But this is only something you can assume for people you know. Once you offer a playbook up to the masses, either you're saying "this works for my group, maybe you'll like it too, take a gamble" or you're gonna try making a playbook that appeals to, and works for, a range of players. And yes, considering that range is much easier said than done. Not gonna lie.<br/><br/>Patrick, your criticism of the Hocus and Chopper above is, in part, based on <i>possible</i> versions of their people. The Chopper's gang must be adept at violence, yes, but they don't <i>have</i> to be thieves and rapists. The Chopper player, and even the other players too, have the ability to customize that gang (same with the Hardholder's gang) using both tags and by just saying stuff about them.<br/><br/>The Hocus' followers are even more wide open. They can be literally anyone as long as they look up to the Hocus, who might not even be able to order them around. Compare that to the Last Child's family, for example. It can be almost anything, too, but the restriction of "family" is tighter than that of "followers." In a sense, the Last Child is to the Hocus what the Maestro D' is to the Hardholder. Which I am okay with, because as I said above, that small difference in the range of options is something to keep in mind maybe, but still rather trivial.<br/><br/>You still have a valid criticism though! Sometimes a playbook always monopolizes the MC's attention (the Hoarder) and sometimes it's only one of a playbook's possible options that does that. One of the reasons I have been thinking about this so much comes from running a game where the Hoarder had a secret lair, the Quarantine had a secret lair, and the Savvyhead has a secret lair. Half the time I'm running one game, the other half I'm running three games at the same time. And then there's managing hold from the hoard and deciding what it wants, the Quarantine is asking these questions every session, and then the Savvyhead has stuff to build. So there's two additional layers of overhead for each character on top of what you would normally do when running the game. It's just too much. Parts of that game went well, but parts of it suffered, and mainly just because players said "this playbook looks cool, I will play this one." And I have seen this a lot. Even good players do this. I've done it. People pick a playbook and sit back, allowing the stuff on the playbook to settle them into the setting and the game, allowing it to define their relationships with other characters and maybe "coasting," if you will, instead of working to create the setting/premise the way they might when playing a GMless game, say, or one with less "infrastructure." If this happens with a playbook that isn't good at contributing, you can find yourself in a situation where you have to "play catch up" later and bring an unfocused game back together.<br/><br/>So, I'm not saying any of these criticisms are game-breaking or even very serious on their own. So the Maestro D' doesn't want to even leave the establishment? So what? I played that game too, it was fine. So the bikers are assholes, somebody has to be, why not them? It's when they build up and you get lots of them that they can become a problem. And in general, the basic 11 give you things, both good things and bad things, that you would tend to expect in a post-apocalyptic place. Whereas, <i>in general</i>, the limited edition playbooks give you a smaller range or options regarding what they bring to the game, which are perhaps unusual, and in some cases have explicit rules that focus the MC's attention on them to the exclusion of the other players/characters.<br/><br/>Now, if you write a playbook and it has just one thing that could prove to be a problem for other players or could monopolize the MC's attention--a fixed location, some guys who are jerks, questions you ask the MC, etc--then you are fine, really. As long as the playbook is solid and nobody hates it, it will work, probably nobody will even notice or think about it other than me.<br/><br/><b>If you have several things like that, then maybe think about them and see what you can do to make the playbook more generous, is really what I'm saying.</b> (With like a billion words.)<br/><br/>(And also, if you make a playbook where every version of the playbook has like a secret lair where your god talks only to you and answers questions and gives you advice and you have a move where your god gets hold and the MC spends it (in addition to answering your questions and telling you stuff, that is) and your secret lair is also a workspace where you can make like animal companions or something that obey you and cancel out moves made by other playbooks but each one is unique and has an important flaw that the MC roleplays and oh my god make it stop then yeah, you should probably just fuck off with that one and not show it to anybody.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412965/#Comment_412965" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-28T12:50:21+00:00" title="April 28, 2013 12:50PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2013 12:50PM by Johnstone.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What you want is a balance of setting-defining characters and setting-consuming characters, so that the people who like to get in and mix things up can go interact with the stuff that belongs to the people who like to have established things to manage.</blockquote>\nHmm.

Fuck yes.

I don't mean <i>dependent</i> exactly, I mean that they more-strongly imply relationships. If you're a guy that fixes things, it implies you have relationships with people who own things that need fixing. If you're good at violence it is easy to say "I have this stuff because I fucked some people up and they're dead now. And when you make up some NPCs, MC, maybe I'll fuck them up too." This is partly because of rpg culture's history and baggage and also partly because violence is a way of removing things from the game.<br/><br/>If the Skinner says "I have stuff because I manipulated people, but that was somewhere else. When you make up some new NPCs, MC, maybe I'll manipulate them," the MC can always say "who did you manipulate back then?" and then bring them back. Not so much with dead people. I mean okay, the Skinner could say "those people died" or whatever and the psychic maelstrom can bring dead people back, but a) it's more likely to happen in one case than the other and b) that's saying something pretty definite about the psychic maelstrom that may not be appropriate for all games.<br/><br/>So I mean that skill at violence can often imply being independent and sociopathic, while other skills more often imply a set of on-going relationships.

It comes loaded with friendly NPCs, threat NPCs, and none of the hassles of keeping track of restrictive tags. The cost is that you don't get <b><i>Wealth</i></b> with it, and your gang doesn't have a move associated with it but the <b>Maestro D'</b> has +2hot so that should help, and with the right improvements you've got a mini-hold that stays functional as long as you pay attention to it.<br/>(And it can potentially be mobile!

But then, you also said you were exaggerating your example to prove our point.<br/>Basically what I'm saying is this: the limited edition playbooks are not "less-than" the core 11, they're just different. How a group of players brings them to the table and how the MC adjudicates the focus of the story is going to be different for every group and that isn't programmed into a playbook (except maybe for the Hoarder but I can think of ways of making the hoard relevant to other PCs) so I don't think you can really categorize a concept as <i>lesser</i> when it still functions properly.\n<blockquote>One of the reasons I have been thinking about this so much comes from running a game where the Hoarder had a secret lair, the Quarantine had a secret lair, and the Savvyhead has a secret lair.

Without using legwork to bring them outside you've got three characters who are basically homebodies.\n<blockquote>(And also, if you make a playbook where every version of the playbook has like a secret lair where your god talks only to you and answers questions and gives you advice and you have a move where your god gets hold and the MC spends it (in addition to answering your questions and telling you stuff, that is) and your secret lair is also a workspace where you can make like animal companions or something that obey you and cancel out moves made by other playbooks but each one is unique and has an important flaw that the MC roleplays and oh my god make it stop then yeah, you should probably just fuck off with that one and not show it to anybody.)</blockquote>\nLike druids in AD&amp;D? :-P\n<blockquote>I also think one should look for things that can push the game to much in one direction.

One has to be careful.<br/><br/>I also don't allow the Juggernaut and the Beast Master in one game.<br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> it's way to pacific rim<br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> A Hardhold with 2 bigass weapons is a bit much.</blockquote>\nSee, I think making blanket statements like "I don't allow..." is bad. Mainly because I think the players should have <i>some</i> say as to what kind of character they're going to play. Having an animal-themed game sounds, to me, just as fun as having a game with a Juggernaut and a Beast Master in it, and just as fun as a resource-poor raider-filled evil-psychic-landscape themed game.<br/><br/>I read one of Vincent's comments where he said he starts a game by giving a limited number of playbooks, choosing 7 or 8 ahead of time for the kind of game he wants to run, and I think that's really where the MC's input in character creation should begin and end. Describing to the players the kind of theme or atmosphere they want, and maybe restricting a few playbooks, but not leaving them completely off the table.<br/>This is getting really off-topic, but I'm just going to leave <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://nerdwerds.blogspot.com/2013/04/apocalyscotia.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a></span></i></b> here.

I don't mean <i>dependent</i> exactly, I mean that they more-strongly imply relationships. If you're a guy that fixes things, it implies you have relationships with people who own things that need fixing. If you're good at violence it is easy to say "I have this stuff because I fucked some people up and they're dead now. And when you make up some NPCs, MC, maybe I'll fuck them up too."

(Just happens*): At the beginning of the roleplaying session roll + Weird; on a 10+ choose both, on a 7-9 the MC choose 1:<br/>-Insight<br/>-Augury<br/>You are assault by visions that can\u2019t control but would be of some (or significant) help trough the session. Their comes and goes as their (the MC) please. <br/>Backward: When you miss on the roll + Weird, you misinterpreted the visions and works as a detriment against you. (Goes in the wrong direction, somebody get 1-hold on you, you \u201copen your brain\u201d involuntarily in the worst moment, you becomes delusional seeing things are not there, talking to people that don\u2019t exist, etc.).  <br/>\u2022Psychotic break (Stress situations*): When you are in a state of delusional madness or just being freaking scary and attack someone, you gain +1-armor and +1-harm. The adrenaline rushes give you strength and being stub, shot, burn, hit doesn\u2019t bother you as much.<br/><br/>Backward: You finish exhausted and usually in pain. You are more vulnerable for a time equal to your psychotic break and suffer +1-harm and -1 to any roll you do (except \u201cwhen you suffer harm\u201d roll that adds +1). At MC discretion you may faint instead. <br/>\u2022Laughing out Loud (At will*): You can laugh really, Really LOUD. So loud you damage people. (1-harm ap area loud reload)<br/>Goes off like a reusable grenade. Hits everyone but you<br/>Backward: You become powerless for a scene. You lose access to all of your character moves. You can still make basic moves. <br/>\u2022Maniacal depression (At will*): You can roll + Weird instead of roll + Hot when try to seduce or manipulated someone. <br/>Backward: That person gain 1-hold on you. If you miss, gain 2-hold instead of 1.<br/>\u2022Paranoia (Always*): You gain +1 question when you roll \u201cread a person\u201d and when you roll \u201cread a stich\u201d. <br/>Backward: You gain Hx-1 with All the others player characters at the end of the session. (\u201cThere is something shady about their, all of their. Their are hiding something from you, something Important\u201d). Also add -1 to all your barter rolls (You are suspicious about the deal). <br/><br/> *Always meant that is Always active and you can\u2019t control it.<br/>*At Will: You can choose to make that specific roll or the normal roll instead. With the normal roll you suffer no backward.<br/>*Stress situations are that, stress situations (a fight, when you are humiliated, threatened, in danger, harm, etc.).<br/>*Just Happens: the MC controls the situation. <br/>Derangements special: For every 2d6 -character Weird roleplaying sessions, the character gain +1-derangement accumulative to any their already have. Past that amount of sessions, roll again to see when gain another. This happens even if the characters change of playbook.

The cost is that you don't get <b><i>Wealth</i></b> with it, and your gang doesn't have a move associated with it but the <b>Maestro D'</b> has +2hot so that should help, and with the right improvements you've got a mini-hold that stays functional as long as you pay attention to it.<br/>(And it can potentially be mobile! What a plus!)</blockquote>\nWell, I was thinking more along the lines that whatever kind of establishment the Maestro D' can have, the Hardholder can also have, plus more. Just in terms of what the fiction looks like. The hardhold can have a bar, nightclub, whatever, and it could even be mobile, in caravans, on a ship perhaps. You're right to make the point that they work by different mechanics, though. Plus there's definitely design space for people to create alternate versions of playbooks like the Chopper, the Hardholder, and the Hocus that all have different ways of manipulating people and places.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413130/#Comment_413130" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T17:37:19+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  5:37PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RedPilgrim, your concept is fine. It's murderhobo and niche, but so is the Faceless, and many people like "the crazy guy." You got good names, too!<br/><br/>Your mechanics are too fiddly and complicated, though. I think you need to reduce a lot of them down to simpler expressions of the concepts you have for this character. I think playing it will probably show you some stuff that is unnecessary.<br/><br/>In terms of organization, I don't think you need the bonus and weakness of the derangement. This character can work fine with 3 moves and 1 weakness, just like the Faceless does, and the two lists don't need to be connected. The bonuses from derangements you can turn into moves. For example:\n<blockquote>\u2022What the fuck? (Just happens*): At the beginning of the roleplaying session roll + Weird; on a 10+ choose both, on a 7-9 the MC choose 1:<br/>-Insight<br/>-Augury<br/>You are assault by visions that can\u2019t control but would be of some (or significant) help trough the session. Their comes and goes as their (the MC) please. <br/>Backward: When you miss on the roll + Weird, you misinterpreted the visions and works as a detriment against you. (Goes in the wrong direction, somebody get 1-hold on you, you \u201copen your brain\u201d involuntarily in the worst moment, you becomes delusional seeing things are not there, talking to people that don\u2019t exist, etc.).</blockquote>\nFor one thing, there isn't really a weakness here. When you miss a weird roll, the MC already gets to do all of this stuff. It seems like you are trying to imply that the MC's hard move should include hallucinations and visions, yeah? But all you need for that is to cue the MC that this is a crazy, hallucinating character -- and the MC already knows that! This is the "crazy person" playbook. Or, for a character that is <i>really</i> not in control of their visions and doesn't rely on the MC's moves for their craziness, you could borrow a weakness from the Quarantine playbook:<br/>*When you act under fire, you also open your brain (roll+weird as normal).<br/>*when you read a person, you also open your brain (roll+weird as normal).<br/>And then the player who really wants to have crazy visions all the time will for sure pick one of these as their weakness (I have seen the Quarantine with the second one in play, he was crazy, hallucinating dude a lot).<br/><br/>For the bonus part, I think you should make up your mind between insight and augury and just make it a normal Freak move. Personally, I think of augur as more of a deliberate thing, where you want to be in control. But insight I think is perfect for a crazy character. Maybe something like this:<br/><br/><b>Talking to God:</b> When you are incapacitated by mystic visions, you gain insight.<br/><br/>Very simple, the exact wording can be fiddled with, but it gives you the bonus move, makes you have visions to get it, and also tells the MC what kind of crazy character you are -- the visionary, hallucinating kind and the MC will respond with hard moves as appropriate.<br/><br/>Does that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim" title="RedPilgrim"><img alt="RedPilgrim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim">RedPilgrim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413132/#Comment_413132" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T18:26:32+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  6:26PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>*For the unintiated, the clan of Vampires in Masquerade who all have one or more Derangements and weird mental powers, one of my favorite clans to play personally but generally disliked as a clan because of the dysfunctional play that results.<br/><br/><br/>I admit it, I love Malkavians. Play one for long time. But as all character is what YOU do with it. Tzimisce and Lasombra are far more dysfunctionals and dificult to go in a group and work as clan that the Malkavians. Same could be said of all the others clans.<br/><br/>Abauot The Freak...<br/>Yes I know. Is kind of confusing, is part of the idea.<br/>Is base in the kind of game that my group is playing rigth now, and something we read about the <a href="http://www.arcano13.com/fanzine/spip.php?article567" rel="nofollow">psychic maelstrom</a> The thing is in spanish, so...I hope you can understanded.<br/>It is crazy and it is born from the psychic maelstrom.<br/> In the corebook say that if someboby will find out what it is, are the players. Acording to the game you are running, this characer could be the guide to uncover the mystery or the one who ensure that nobody ever find out.<br/>Sence a rumblng idiot to something more "deep".<br/>I base some of the skills in the Faceless, but seems to powerful, that's why the derangements and limitations, and deep consecuences on a miss.<br/>All characters are nutcases at some point, but this one cross the line, and not. Does the Freaky Weapon have a soul trap in it, or is it part of the character fantasy? Suffer alucinations or are actually things there send by the psychic maelstrom to guide it, punish it?<br/>Is part of the versatility that AW offers. Any playbook could be "Good", "Bad", "in between", something else, this is the same. The player use it and give it the personality, the purpose.<br/>What The Freak have to offers? Whatever you want. <br/>Can offers more "clarity" or add confusion to AW, depends of what you want, and/or the game you are playing needs.<br/><br/>When my friends and I  create the characters we are playing now, we made nomads in a poisoned land, with canibals everywhere.<br/>With the MC, each one of us make a copy of the page in the corebook with the circle (resources, treats, etc.) and each of us fulfill it, then the MC took it and made the world, the same for the characters.<br/>Something i did not read in the comments above was Objetives. When we create characters we give their a lot of objetives, to short terms and to long terms, and in base of that the MC do the adventures we play. The reasons why their move. We help him to make the world, he give sense to it.<br/>Rigth now the group is made of nomads, vile wanderers. (We are playing the "bad guys"); The Freak is base in that, the kind of game we are running. Something that usualy wont stay in one place (different of the Hardholder, the Angel, The Hocus, The savvyhead, The Maestro D, etc.), is a vagabond with no roots. A prophet? A psychopath? A Savior? Your choice.<br/>Thats why the tokens, to give it colour and versatility, make their differents of one another. <br/>Run with a hand puppet and use the remot control to turn it on and switch the puppet mood, or playing the violin wilde you are wearing a reinforced straitjacket and a cage in your head... The primary stat is Weird after all, does not meant that isn't functional.<br/>Is one of the most misundetud things about the Malkavians. Their are crazy, yes. So? Besides that live for centuries. One thing have nothing to do with the other, here, in AW is the same. Being a rumbling incoherent does not meant you can't be functional and save the day.<br/> That you speak with your Freaky Weapon, does not meant you do it in public or even in front of the other characters.<br/>As all playbook, as all character is what YOU, the player do with it.<br/>And the Freak IS NOT A MALKAVIAN, is crazy o is it not. Simply could had a different perspective of the world and acces to thing that the others not.<br/>Is up to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim" title="RedPilgrim"><img alt="RedPilgrim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim">RedPilgrim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413136/#Comment_413136" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T18:45:22+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  6:45PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>RedPilgrim, your concept is fine.

Oppresing his people, sending his gang against other communities, making a deal with some chopper using it to attack other community, and then send his own gang against both, the chopper and the attacked one taking advantage of the casualties killing the ones that stand againt, and becoming a dictator on those who survive. And keep doing stuff like that. Becoming a conqueror.<br/>The same goes to the Hocus, the Chopper, the Maestro D', all character, playbooks, classes, can be murderhobos depending in how they are use. Is up the player and how take advantage of the skill, moves the character have.<br/>Obviously had a lot to do with the kind of game and player you are running, but all character had the potential to become murderhobo.<br/>The Faceless use a Brutal Weapon, a Brainer can use people as weapons. The only real difference between murderhobos is the kind of "weapons" used. Some are subtle, some not, but the result is the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413238/#Comment_413238" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T19:58:41+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  7:58PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2013 8:00PM by Johnstone.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh! Sorry for the confusion. I should clarify that then:<br/><br/>Murderhobo is a term for a type of D&amp;D character (in one type of D&amp;D) that only cares about gold, because gold = xp. Because the game consists of almost nothing but dungeons full of monsters and treasures, and doesn't care about who your character was before the dungeon or what they aspire to become after the dungeon, players find that sociopathic characters are often the most successful.<br/><br/>Because they have no past and are adventuring in an unfamiliar land, staying at inns, and possibly wandering over large tracks of unexplored land, they are often quite literally hobos -- they have no homes.<br/><br/>They are murderhobos -- hobos who are murderers -- partly because they kill people and take their stuff. And not just monsters either, but anybody with treasure who won't give them assistance. For example, once players realize that the Keep on the Borderlands has more treasure in it than the monster-infested caves, and that the people who run it are dicks, they often turn on the keep and raid it instead of the dungeons. These are just imaginary people, after all, who cares about them?<br/><br/>But also because it is often very useful to hire NPC retainers to help you out in the dungeon, but they also take a share of the xp away from PCs. So it behooves you to hire retainers and get them killed before you exit the dungeon. Sometimes, if players are really desperate for xp, they will kill these retainers themselves. It's just an imaginary character, you can always hire a new one later, right?<br/><br/>So a murderhobo character in general is one who has<br/>a) little or no real past, or nothing important in it or about it that relates to other characters;<br/>b) little or no desire to have meaningful relationships with NPCs; and<br/>c) uses violence to get what they want most, or even all, of the time.<br/><br/>This mentality is usually strongest at level 1, when the players know nothing about the setting and have no attachment to it. They tend to find NPCs that entertain them later on as the backstory and setting is built through play. But because you get xp from finding treasure, not from doing good deeds or even defeating monsters, these characters tend to be scoundrels, not paladins.<br/><br/>So when I see playbooks that don't come with mandatory relationships and are good at violence, I call these murderhobo playbooks. You can't play a Hardholder like a murderhobo because the Hardholder derives her power from her gang and her holding--from her relationships with NPCs. You can play the Chopper's gang like a murderhobo gang, but you can't play the Chopper like that because he has to socialize with his gang. You can play a Battlebabe, a Gunlugger, or a Faceless like a murderhobo very easily -- especially if you come from a D&amp;D background. Nothing on those playbooks says explicitly "hey, you can't be a homeless dude who wanders around murdering people." The talking mask implies it, or the MC can say it through the mask. The Battlebabe's shitty hard stat implies it but then Ice Cold says there's a way out of that. And there's Hx but that's with PCs and there's that murderhobo gentleman's agreement that PCs don't kill PCs. Plus some of those Hx questions are bad. Plus this is AW so we don't even have to have scenes together, I mean, why would we, we barely know each other.<br/><br/>I should maybe go into that a bit more, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim" title="RedPilgrim"><img alt="RedPilgrim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim">RedPilgrim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413240/#Comment_413240" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T21:52:53+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  9:52PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see. Well... My last AD&amp;D character was a tiflin rogue NE. Was the Devil Itself and act as you describe a murderhobo, but had 16 pages of story behind (and wasn't even born) Had a huge past before start playing it and basicly, in play, he kills every thing that cross his way. Was kind of a sociopath, he interact with the other PC and NPCs, talk a lot (his favorite hobby was make clerics and paladins to lose their faith), still violence was his favorite way to do things. The other two characters in the group was a human warrior (LN) and an elf bard (CG) and all get along pretty well. My tiflin follow his plan to create a realm just to see it burn (yes, was Very evil) and use the other characters for it. Constantly saving the bard (in his mind, he was the only one who had right to harm him) and providing the warrior with weapons and armors. Every thing else just die in the most horrible way. Had a very great relationship with many NPCs because they was part of his plan, making alliances and deals; still, in almost any place that he put a foot, every thing end burning.<br/>So... How you classify him? For your definition, he actualy wasn't a murderhobo but act like one.<br/><br/>I only play 3 characters like this (really, Really, REALLY EVIL) the tiflin, a Lasombra with the Path of the Night in Vampire: The Masquerade, and now a Batlle Babe in Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>This last one is traveling with a gunlugger and a brainer. A great part of creating the characters was their past in that particular world and their personal story as the one their have together.<br/>I'm agreed with you about the Hardholder to certain ponit, the Chopper... Have <b>Pack Alpha</b> where he/she Impose over the gang and have Hard as a primary stat (so the Hardholder by the way). Can do a lot of damage by itself, with and without the gang. Can easily fall in the "c" option you describe above. Maybe not so efficient as others playbooks, but can try.<br/>The Maestro D' have <b>You call this hot?</b> and <b>devil with a blade</b>. <br/><br/>I undestand what you are saying about the murderhobo concept, and i'm agreed that many character fall into that category, but I'm not entirely convice that a playbook per se take that way. Is more about the choices that the player take that the ones the playbook sugest.<br/>With the rebuild of The Freak playbook, i made it more "social". Yes, had a very big and harmful weapon, a relationship with it too, but most of the move are to socialize with PC and NPCs, and also had a chance of survive in combat without being actualy good in a fight. That's why I give it those stats too, to make it flexible.<br/>But yes, the Gunlugger and the Faceless are basically murderhobos.<br/><br/>A sidebar question. Does the character of Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York falls into the Hardholder playbook? Violence was his way to solve his problems and everybody was afraid of him. He keep his position through personal murders (and his gang).\n<blockquote> Plus this is AW so we don't even have to have scenes together, I mean, why would we, we barely know each other.<br/><br/>I should maybe go into that a bit more, too.</blockquote>\nI'm very interested in that las part you mentioned.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413298/#Comment_413298" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T14:09:50+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  2:09PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, but those 16 pages were all you. That was <i>your</i> contribution to the game, as a player. The game didn't ask you to do that, the game doesn't have rules where you get to reincorporate that into the fiction by using the rules, and the game doesn't tell the DM to make anything on those pages relevant to the the adventure. So as far as the game itself is concerned yeah, murderhobo. And then you're adding all the roleplaying stuff to it. Sounds cool! Playing murderhobos is super fun if everybody is on board with it!<br/><br/>But here's the thing: We're not playing AW or AD&amp;D because we can't play rpgs without them. I don't need a set of rules to play a role-playing game. You don't either. We can just talk and make up rules or use ones we remember from games we played before, right? We play a specific game for a number of reasons, and one of those is for what that game adds to the conversation. So if "what the player brings" to the game is the solution to a game design problem, then why play a game at all? Why make any new playbooks at all? It is because you are building an experience for someone else -- someone (many someones) you don't know, if you are releasing it out into the internet. In terms of products, it is okay to say something is good enough and you don't know how to make it better and you don't want to work on it anymore. In terms of game design skills and knowledge, though, anyone who designs games and is done becoming a better game designer is dead or might as well be.<br/><br/>So! With my analysis above I am talking about only what the playbook adds to the experience. And I've noticed that<br/>a) playbooks with a <i>mandatory</i> connection to the setting (Hardholder, etc) add more to the game than others; and<br/>b) playbooks that <i>strongly</i> imply connections and relationships (Angel, etc) add more than those that only weakly imply connections (Gunlugger, etc);<br/><br/>AND that<br/>c) playbooks that add locations/people/relationships to the game that all the PCs can interact with and have something to do with (Hocus, etc) add more to the game than those that add things that are more exclusive to that particular playbook (Hoarder, etc) because<br/>d) exclusive stuff takes up more of the MC's attention and demands spotlight time on one player alone if other PCs can't interact<br/><br/>BUT that<br/>e) feeding into the genre conventions of the game and setting is also a valuable asset for a playbook to have, even if it only weakly implies connections to other people.<br/><br/>So anyway, I don't want to get too sidetracked with the murderhobo thing, because of course the game doesn't <i>make</i> you play a murderhobo when you're not supposed to, but it is important to distinguish between using violence to maintain and manage relationships, which is what hardholders and choppers do, and using violence to <i>end</i> relationships, which is what murderhobos do. One produces more opportunities for role-playing, the other reduces them.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York: As far as I remember, that dude is <i>totally</i> a Hardholder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413299/#Comment_413299" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T14:19:48+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  2:19PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone, I really really like your last post.  It makes me think of Playbooks like little Lego sets that you play with along with your friends.  Some Lego sets, like the Gunlugger, have little props in them (little Lego guns) that make your minifig character cooler; some come with extra minifigs to represent the extra NPC's your character brings to the game, and some, like the Driver or Maestro D', come with a vehicle or building that you can bring with you to the sandbox.  <br/><br/>Obviously, the Lego sets that have stuff that other kids can play with, too, are going to have a bigger impact on communal play then the ones, like the Gunlugger or Hoarder, who have little personal props that the other players' aren't supposed to mess with.  <br/><br/>This is a great way of looking at player roles in games.  As a test of concept, I'm now trying to think of other public spaces that would be genre-appropriate for an AW game, to see if that's a useful way to come up with new playbook ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413304/#Comment_413304" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T14:45:40+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  2:45PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2013 2:46PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah!

crew, I think, because you still have to interact with them as individuals, but Moonlighting is basically the roll+cool version of Wealth and Fortunes, yeah. That's actually what my original reference was to. I mean, the Hocus move Frenzy is also a way of managing groups of people, but I was more thinking of the default moves for having a large group of non-violent people affiliated with you, which are about extracting advantage or surplus from them and maintaining some kind of fictional authority or leverage over them.<br/><br/>So then, what do the hot and sharp versions look like? Roll+hot to extract surplus from a mass is obviously Celebrity, and roll+sharp must be something investing-based like Creative Accounting maybe. Neither of which are particularly post-apocalyptic, but that's what hacks are for. Also, that's only one man's perspective.

Concept is fine and all, no problem there, but the point of a stat-increasing resource is that you are awesome <i>with</i> the resource but <i>vulnerable</i> without it. Where's the vulnerability? The Wrangler is as tough as a Gunlugger without animals, and a fucking munchkin with them, you can get a +2 bonus to your best stat AND you get bonuses to almost ALL of the basic moves. AND then I can take two moves and I've got roll+2 <i>minimum</i> for all my basic moves.<br/><br/>I think it's really the wrong way to go with this one. A pack of dogs is like a gang--it extends the reach and scope of your violence, but there is no way in hell it increases your ability to inflict violence without consequences. Removing consequences is okay if it's done with a light touch. Done to this degree and it's like why bother even play? Let's just say you win.<br/><br/>This is the kind of stuff that we should talk about when we get to moves, though.

Not everybody will have seen these problems in play, of course, but I have so I know they are real.<br/><br/>A thing I notice that comes from the playbook format is when players pick up a playbook and assume that this it contains all the stuff they need to do to set up the game. Once they go through these steps, they switch to doing what the game asks of players, which is playing the character, and playing the character hard. This means, sometimes, that the same players who work really hard in, say, a GMless game, to build connection and conflicts between characters and really work together with the group, will barely talk with each other about which playbooks they want, will only have the relationships mandated by Hx and resources that come with the playbook, and will look to the MC to sort everything out in play.<br/><br/>This leads to stuff like three PCs with secret lairs, as I mentioned above, but also to another game where I ended up almost playing a separate game entirely. Because we assumed the playbooks would take care of everything--and I did this, too, this is not a blame-post--and a few small mistakes that snowballed, the other PCs had little or no relationship to my character so when I went around offering them scenes with my guy, they all turned me down because they were playing their characters.<br/><br/>So, this happened for a couple reasons. Our characters knew each other but weren't allies so we didn't help the MC weave us together at all where the playbooks didn't force us. One thing I noticed fell really flat, playing the Savvyhead, was the Hx questions on that playbook.<br/><br/>In the Hx phase, you as the Savvyhead pick a character you think is strange and a character you think is a problem. so basically, what you get out of this phase, from this playbook, is some opinions. Sure, this is a starting point for the MC to ask questions, but there are a couple problems here.<br/><br/>One is that I've got opinions about another character but I can't say things about them, because that's the other player's thing. I can't say "I think Sundown is a problem because she does this, that, and the other thing." I'm stuck riffing off another player's description of who their character is and what they look like, without being able to easily translate that into stuff that characters actually do. we can still hash it out, but these Hx questions don't actually make that process easier.<br/><br/>Second, opinions don't frame scenes for shit. "I think Spider is the weird one" does not instantly translate into a scene. If the MC says "okay, let's have a scene that shows why you think Spider is weird" what happens? Yeah, we talk a bunch more before we get to the scene.<br/><br/>Now, what does the Savvyhead do? He produces items, he fixes items, he collects information through items. The workspace implies that he produces items for other people, that he fixes items for other people, and maybe that he can be a detective as well. So, if we had Hx question options (even just options!) like "I fix things for ________ on a regular basis," and "I once built a machine for ________" then suddenly bam! we have actual relationships based on actions, we have potential scenes, we have the Savvyhead doing Savvyhead things. The MC can look at these and say "So hey, Cobra, Spector fixes things for you allatime, does he? Let's see that," and you have a scene right away. Why do you need to decide their opinions of each other? You can just ROLEPLAY YOUR CHARACTERS and find out! And seriously, I've seen several Savvyheads in play, and these fixing and building scenes are always outnumbered by the "mad scientist working alone in the shop on a thing for himself" kind of scenes.<br/><br/>So, that is one small example of making incremental changes to playbooks, in order to make it more conductive to good play. This doesn't mean the Savvyhead is a crap playbook or anything. This is just one little thing. You tweak it, it becomes more efficient. You have to do this all over the place in order to build a good playbook, and there will probably always be room for improvement (depending on your audience, of course), but if you are ever overwhelmed by the amount of work making a full playbook is, go small and work on just one little thing like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim" title="RedPilgrim"><img alt="RedPilgrim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim">RedPilgrim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413434/#Comment_413434" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T15:04:03+00:00" title="May  2, 2013  3:04PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone   I follow your advice of doing something more interactive with the NPCs, and made <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6354.0" rel="nofollow">The Roadrunner</a> Base the concept in The Postman (the Kevin Costner movie) and The Currier#6 from Fallout: New Vegas, the differences is that isn't a figthing playbook, more one of run and hide. <br/>With <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6352.0" rel="nofollow">The Freak</a> the idea was do something weird-WEIRD, this is more... social interactive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413441/#Comment_413441" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T16:47:08+00:00" title="May  2, 2013  4:47PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there are lots of little tweaks that can be made to AW.<br/><br/>I've noticed that unless you're aggressive as a player about integrating people, they tend to have parallel but separate stories. It's an easy fix, you just need to make sure everyone is intimate with someone in a love-dodecahedron. <br/><br/>From my current game, the Angel's Infirmary and the Lost Child's Family have almost the same memberships, the Angel being the Last Child's mother. The Angel is in love with the Skinner, and they're hooking up, and the Angel and Last Child need the Brainer for some Maelstrom support. The Maestro'Ds cafe is pretty much right next to the Infirmary, which is where everyone hangs out when they're not hanging in the Infirmary - both of which are located within a hardhold. So, most of the action takes place within the same handful of locations, and generally includes three out of five of the PCs.<br/><br/>Mind you, and this is fair criticism, this took four or five sessions of explicit work on my (the Angel's) part to make happen. The game doesn't tend to this at all. <br/><br/>So, my advice here is this, whenever possible have character assets be shared or proximate (like the Infirmary and the Family; or the proximity of the Establishment and the Infirmary) and have the character's relationships be intimate. I do whenever I'm playing any games. I try to bake in as many intimate relationships (family, lovers, best friends, coworkers) with the other PCs as possible. And if that's not baked in, then I try to establish it play in the first couple of sessions.<br/><br/>Like say you've a Hoarder, a Savvyhead, an Operator and a Quarantine. Make the Hoard, the Statis Facility and the Workspace in the same place. I dunno, some huge ruinous hi-tech scrap heap ancient vault thing.

If you break down the Driver it looks like this: fancy car, driver move, one pick from special moves, <i>and a stat penalty</i>. Sure the Driver can replace weird with his high sharp, but he still has lower cool/hard/hot than other characters. Not by much, but a little -- he's less optimal out of the car and a badass in the car. So he has fictional incentive to get out and do things that don't involve the car, but isn't crippled enough so that he's paranoid about it. And he has mechanical incentive to get in the car and do cool-ass shit because he can pull it off.<br/><br/>The Wrangler swaps out the car for a dog pack, his bonuses apply to more move, and he doesn't take the stat penalty. Now, the stats and number of moves and bonus shit doesn't always have to equal out or anything, because that's not the kind of game balance that matters (having viable choices is what matters), but I can easily make a Wrangler that can pretty much hold his own with the other PCs <i>without the pack</i>, and then when I actually ahem... let the dogs out, there just about aren't any misses. So not only am I hogging spotlight time away from the other PCs with my competency (as opposed to hogging spotlight time through my weaknesses), I'm not even really incentivized to be "the guy with the dog pack." I'm incentivized to be "the guy with the secret super-weapon." A stat-bonus resource works best when it raises your low stats, not when it raises your stats that are already high.<br/><br/>I think the animal companion move works well in Dungeon World -- where you may also notice the Ranger takes a penalty to his damage to make up for the animal's damage bonus. He needs his animal to do damage on par with the Fighter. I don't think it's doing the concept justice in the case of the Wrangler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413532/#Comment_413532" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T01:58:47+00:00" title="May  5, 2013  1:58AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            His Bonus actually doesn't apply to all moves - or at least not at first.

That puts limits on the pack being an all-round roll-booster, that's true. I'm still looking at that hard-on-hard bonus like it's dirty pool, though, and relying on the severity of MC moves shouldn't be a factor. The MC should be judging the fiction and that's it.<br/><br/>Partly it's having that right out of the gate, which gives you little to work towards. But also you have an enhancement and an expansion at the same time. The driver gets an enhancement of low starting stats, but no expansion of their capacity to do violence, aside from being able to move faster (most of the time). The Chopper and Hardholder don't get any enhancement of their capacity to do violence except in terms of extra harm from gang size, but their capacity is greatly expanded. They can commit violence far away from themselves and in multiple places at a time. The Wrangler's maybe not getting the <i>best</i> of both worlds, but he's getting most of them. Or to put it another way, it seems like the Wrangler is set up specifically to kick major ass and comes front-loaded with just about every rule that supports that. And I don't really see a guy with a pack of dogs as being tougher, deadlier, and more effective at violence than a guy who leads a biker gang, just harder to shake off when he's after you (and also this could be a factor in my reaction but do we really need more "I'm 'a kick everbody's ass" playbooks?).<br/><br/>(Also in case anyone is wondering: Yes, I am this hard on my own playbooks too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413534/#Comment_413534" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T03:56:13+00:00" title="May  5, 2013  3:56AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how would you fix this?

You can't put a car in your pocket, or take it to a dance, or whatever -- the Driver doesn't work well unless they're on the open road. Another important thing about cars is that, once you get out of them, they aren't yours any more. If somebody takes the Driver's keys, now it's their car, and the Driver has to get it back. A park of dogs doesn't really have that characteristic, because definitionally, a pack of dogs is both loyal and complicated.<br/><br/>However, when the Driver is in their car, they're great at everything, because cars are generally useful and heavily symbolic. By contrast, one of the key elements of, say, animal training, is that animals are basically not that good at things -- they can do a few things well, if you spend years training them to do those things, assuming nothing goes wrong, which is probably will. So I don't think I would use the Driver model for the Wrangler.<br/><br/>What is a pack of wild dogs actually good for? What are they problematic for? Why does the Wrangler train them? Are they compensating for weaknesses, or improving strengths they already have at the cost of ignoring their weaker areas?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413551/#Comment_413551" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T12:00:17+00:00" title="May  5, 2013 12:00PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But the "they can only do a bit of stuff" bit is actually in the Wrangler. <br/><br/>What the Wrangler really isn't good at is dealing with single people.

My pack can be good at X tasks. While they're doing X tasks and I'm working with them, I'm good at everything. That's not the same as being good at only one thing! If my pack's trained to hunt, I can try to seduce, or read a situation, or whatever, with a huge boost, as long as I do it while we're hunting.\n<blockquote>What the Wrangler really isn't good at is dealing with single people.

Maybe you could try removing the "when you read a situation" and "when you seduce" from Command.

In my experience of gaming, the player takes ownership of his gimmick and reacts poorly to MC attempts to weaken it, unless they're clearly driven by the fiction or triggered by a specific rule or roll.  Since the MC is supposed to be hitting everybody's tags hard to keep them on their toes, it's asking a lot to have the MC make sure this player gets an extra measure of MC fiat.<br/>EDIT: Not to dogpile on the Wrangler (!), I think it's a important point of game design generally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413568/#Comment_413568" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T22:08:57+00:00" title="May  5, 2013 10:08PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Which is just quibbling about stat blocks in my opinion.</blockquote>\nIf it's just quibbling on stat blocks, then there is no need to defend its inclusion, either, and it can just be removed.\n<blockquote>The Space Marine Mammal starts with a Hard +4 with it's Walkingsuit, the limitation is that the suit eventually powers down if it use it for too long.

I don't think the Wrangler is a perfect playbook and I think a lot of the criticism for it in this thread is valid. Personally, the concept of taking the driver's car resource and applying that <b><i>no shit driver</i></b> kind of move to a new resource is unoriginal. But <b><i>I really like</i></b> the concept of a guy who gets along with animals better than people and has a stable of animals that he has trained. I also like the concept of being able to define what the animals are during character creation, so it's not always a pack of dogs, it could be hyenas, or lizards, or ostrich-legged housecats. <br/><br/>The way I see the playbook, it could use some moves that highlight the wild and random nature of the pack's instincts. For example<br/><b><i>Release the hounds</i></b>: when you let your pack loose, roll+hard and add their <i><b>ferocity</b></i>. On a hit, they attack. On a 10+ choose 2. On a 7-9 choose 1. On a miss, the MC uses the pack's weaknesses against you.<br/>the pack attacks who you want them to attack<br/>the pack fights to the death<br/>the pack will stop when you tell them to                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413572/#Comment_413572" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-05T23:14:57+00:00" title="May  5, 2013 11:14PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2013 11:15PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That playbooks is a real piece of work.

Just looking at the stat blocks would mean this character is a murderhobo.<br/><br/>Now let's be the opposite of cheap and actually make a character with drives and purpose and motivations. <br/><i>His name is Cleat and he just wants to finish building the front porch of his house on the outskirts of the Temper's Flare but somebody is always coming along and fucking with him and preventing him from finishing his work, and last week Frankie threw a molotov in through his window and he had to choose between chasing after that fucker or putting out the fire, and now he's got the frame built but he needs to go out looking for something to nail down as a makeshift roof and the only person who'll deal with his antisocial anxiety is Lafferty and that guy is a pain in the ass to work for so maybe Cleat could convince Grace to help out but they haven't spoken since Cleat accidentally killed her cousin during that fight T-bone's gang started. He could muscle somebody up since that's easy but some weirdo that <b>actually</b> wants to live nearby told him "violence begets violence" and he's taken those words to heart so now he has to go out and try talking to people just on good intentions and honest merit.</i><br/>So here we got a guy whose primary motivation is just to turn a little corner of the world into his personal space to relax and he doesn't really get along with people and tends to fuck up his relationships because of the violence he carries with him. Am I talking about a gunlugger, a wrangler, or something else?<br/><br/>That history gives you the "what for" and does more for the fiction than a stat block of guns or resources or moves ever could and it could apply equally to the Gunlugger or the Wrangler or even the Angel.<br/><br/>You know, I'll say this again, I don't think the criticisms of the Wrangler are invalid. I just think there's a dismissive attitude here toward the concept that is unfair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413583/#Comment_413583" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T02:33:16+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  2:33AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2013 2:43AM by Johnstone.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the concept is fine.

They get armor in their car and a stat boost to go Aggro and SBF. Could you explain that a bit more?</blockquote>\nSure, let's do the Driver.<br/><br/><i>Fiction:</i> It's a guy with a car. The Road Warrior's pretty iconic. Or rather, it's a guy who is good with a car.<br/><br/><i>Experience:</i> You play a character with a dual identity.<br/><br/><i>Mix:</i> Can hold his own with either the hard-asses or the manipulators, but only in his car. Almost no overlap with the other sharp playbook, the Angel, except the stat sub for weird (and this isn't a very weird playbook).<br/><br/><b>No shit driver and the stat array</b><br/>So if you're playing for the first time, you might think you are o-kay out of your car. But then you realize you literally have no special abilities. You just got the basic moves and everybody else has better stats than you, by 1 point, sometimes more. You got sharp, though right, so you an keep your eye on the ball, maybe get back to that car of yours that is supposed to be so good.<br/><br/>And then you get behind the wheel, and aw fuck yeah, now you can take out dudes, now people listen when you talk, now you can jump ravines. That's as long as you stay behind the wheel, anyway. Can't live your whole life there. But that feeling that those misses are going to come a lot less often when you're behind the wheel is exactly how your character feels.<br/><br/><b>Other moves</b><br/>So, two things about these other moves: They mostly function to paper over weaknesses in the Driver (stat reps for cool and weird), and there's nothing for outside the car. You can use your two other playbook moves to take shit like Things Speak or Reputation, but that's all you're going to get. You're never going to be more than just a guy in a car, which is exactly what this playbook is about. I kinda think this playbook would be better without the sharp for cool substitution move, though, but I'm not crazy about conditionless stat substitution moves to begin with, so.<br/><br/><b>The car</b><br/>This may seem weird but aside from the raw numbers, this stuff doesn't really mean much. Tags are just suggestions. If you can talk the MC/group into letting you have all sorts of shit in your car, it's there, whatever it says here. Sure, you pick a weakness, but the idea that these suggestions make a mechanical difference is an illusion. The MC makes as hard a move as they want, always and every time. Maybe they use the ideas on the sheet, maybe not. They probably will, though, so pick the ones you want to come up in play, but seriously... the Hoarder's -1 ongoing from hunger+4 is an actual drawback, a rabbity car isn't. It's colour. It <i>does</i> establish the fiction<br/><br/><b>Special move</b><br/>And this is both, kinda. It's colour that's backed up by mechanics to make it an actual drawback, but at the sam time, it emphasizes how reliance on the car gives you freedom from everyone else. It backs up the dual identity thing.<br/><br/><b>Okay, so...</b><br/>Now, sure, you can start with some hella good odds. You can roll+4 to act under fire or roll+3 for violence or manipulation right out of the gate. And if you work for it, you can up your hard or our hot and be really hot shit. BUT only when you're behind the wheel, which is an incredibly clear line in the fiction. Everybody knows what you can and can't do behind the wheel, everyone knows when you're there and when you're out of it.<br/><br/>This also plays into how they mix with other characters. There's the fictional bit about being useful by having a car, and then there's the mechanical bits. The Driver has (or can get) a better probability of hits than other hard-ass playbooks which means more control over the output of his violence. So he can show them up sometimes. But the other violent characters have two advantages over the Driver here: they can carry around their aptitude for violence wherever they go, and those with gangs can spread it out, into places beyond their presence and over an area (I'll expand on this point in another post). Even when the Driver goes for hard+2, the guys who start with hard+2 will have other advantages adding to their ability to be violent, or they will have branched out into other areas (including taking No Shit Driver if they want). But then, as characters become better they also begin to resembles each other more. But at the very beginning? we have a guy who is just enough better than the others so that everybody, not just the Driver but everybody, notices the difference between the Driver on foot and the Driver behind the wheel.<br/><br/>So that's essentially what you get when you borrow the Driver's stuff and adapt it to other concepts. As everyone knows, I've done this twice. The Horseman is just an alternate version of the Driver, although it could probably do with being more about being a herald of the apocalypse and less about riding around on a thing. The Sorcerer does the animal companion thing, but honestly it's <i>alright</i>, maybe, but not great. I was kinda going for that power-with-a-price thing but Monsterheart's Infernal does that better, without the stat enhancement thing. And I was going for the feeling of being stuck with this thing that isn't you, but I don't think that really comes through well enough. The one clever bit I think the Sorcerer has is that it's a cool playbook, and you don't get a bonus to cool, you just get to modify the 7-9 result a bit. I still <i>like</i> the Horseman but I wouldn't hold either up as examples of excellence or anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds" title="nerdwerds"><img alt="nerdwerds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/515/nJ7S2QOLDAAGX.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds">nerdwerds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413590/#Comment_413590" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T03:25:59+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  3:25AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2013 3:26AM by nerdwerds.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sure, you pick a weakness, but the idea that these suggestions make a mechanical difference is an illusion.

His favorite car was a slow muscle car but I only remember him driving it once, it was a flashy car so he kept it in town and babied it. His third car had the engine removed because my Hardholder needed it to get a crane working and I don't think he ever got the engine back.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Cartoon-Character-Mutley-Laughing.gif"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413594/#Comment_413594" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T03:56:53+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  3:56AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.<br/><br/>So yeah, like Cneph says, something has to come up. Or rather, I'd say it's already the MC's job to make it dangerous, present threats and complications, and make the PCs vulnerable. Bringing up weaknesses and stuff is already part of the job, whether they are written on the sheet or were mentioned during play or the MC decided to add them due to a relationship, off-screen badness, or a missed roll.<br/><br/>So sure, on the one hand, you have a weakness written down and the MC will keep looking at it and harping on it. But on the other hand, you picked it, so this MC is also using consequences you think are okay (for whatever reason), and so they end up saying the obvious "your car is really loud, everybody knows you're here" instead of the unexpected "your doors fall off."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds" title="nerdwerds"><img alt="nerdwerds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/515/nJ7S2QOLDAAGX.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds">nerdwerds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413597/#Comment_413597" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T04:18:49+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  4:18AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or sometimes you just narrate the tags. Not everything requires a roll. We played our game from October until April and I can only remember three times that the Driver used a move with one of his cars and was forced to roll dice. Everything else was narrated.<br/><br/>I put a lot of weight into those narrative weakness tags because I see them come up repeatedly, without dice rolls, from within the fiction of our games. There's nothing in the rules that says these tags are constant detriments, but if you're following the fiction then shouldn't they always be present, relative to the context in which they arise? (i.e. a loud car is always loud, etc.) <br/><br/>There seems to be a general agreement here to discount the tags as flavor for an MC's moves, which they're going to make anyway when the dice get rolled, and that makes me want to also ask: do you as a player ever narrate your weaknesses and bring them into play? or do you avoid them because you want to try and get the best result possible for whatever it is you're doing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413598/#Comment_413598" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T04:30:36+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  4:30AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2013 4:35AM by Praion.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So let's talk a bit about weakness tags. <br/><br/>One of my favourite tags is loud. When your car is loud, it's not only loud, it'S <b>LOUD</b>. You can't have a conversation in it without having to scream at each other. People hear you coming from miles away and even if just the engine is running it's still as loud as a regular car. You will wake the whole hardhold when you drive in. <br/><br/>When your car is slow then it makes 30 km/h per hour, 50 when you push it.

Is my view here to extreme?</blockquote>\nI dunno that I'd say "extreme." But my point is that you're still making a call as an MC. The playbook doesn't do that, the MC does that. Like, yes, the playbook contributes to the fiction and we all respect that contribution because it's something we can agree on without having to discuss it, but it's still just an optional cue for colour and one possibility among many for the MC to use. Maybe one MC goes harder on a PC for having a weakness, another doesn't, but I don't feel that using them as compensation for mechanical bonuses is good design, is what I'm really saying.<br/><br/>And maybe I'm the one on the extreme end, but if the players say "we live in a town with hundred-foot-high walls with laser cannons on them to defend us from the wasteland raiders and we have a machine that purifies the poisoned water for us," I mean, what the fuck do I care? "Great! So the machine stops working. You don't know why. What do you do?" Right? That's the job.<br/><br/>Ugh, advancements. I still have to follow up on the violence, and write some stuff about moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413602/#Comment_413602" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T05:16:53+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  5:16AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, let's do the violence post, since that's a major component of AW.<br/><br/>There's three points where fiction and mechanics meet when violence happens:<br/><br/>1. When a PC can commit violence and thus when they can roll for a move.<br/><br/>2. Rolling for the move and the probabilities of the different outcomes.<br/><br/>3. Harm and armour.<br/><br/>For the first part, every PC can punch or shoot somebody, or drive a car into somebody. But then there's stuff like gangs. You can use a gang to attack a lot more people at a time, or you can use a gang to attack people when you are not there. This is what I mean when I say a PC's ability to commit violence is expanded. With a gang you can attack somebody fifty feet away with a knife, if you get one of your gang to stab them. They also let you attack like five different people at a time without having to use explosives or full-auto. Psychic attacks can let you do this kind of thing, too. But really what expanded means is that you have a thing that allows you to commit violence where you wouldn't normally be able to.<br/><br/>But then you have to roll it. The higher your bonus is, the more control you have over the outcome. On a 6 or less, the MC chooses what happens, and it likely goes bad for you. But on a 7+, you get a say in what happens. So something like a +2 bonus to a roll looks like it says pretty clearly that yes, your bad-assness has gone up, but actually it means your out-of-controlness has gone down. When you have things that make your number go up, that's what I mean by enhancement. So you have your normal level of control, and then you have an enhanced level of control.<br/><br/>It's harm and armour that really decide the impact of violence. Well, and the MC's judgment, but that also happens after this calculation. It's actually pretty easy to get more of both of these, just from the fiction, because you can probably get better weapons (unless you are already using the grenade launcher) and maybe armour too. But there are moves you can get to boost your harm and your armour above and beyond what the fiction gives you, and yes, that definitely contributes to making you a badass.<br/><br/>So, three different areas to improve your use of violence in. Who would you say is best in each?<br/><br/>The Hardholder has the biggest gang, so I'd say her violence is the most expanded.<br/>The Gunlugger can have hard+3 unenhanced but having spent a move on it, and the Driver can roll+3 for hard with his enhancement, so maybe a tie for control?<br/>And of course, the most impactful PC is the one with the grenade laucher, right? No, it's the one with the grenade launcher and Bloodcrazed!<br/><br/>There's maybe a hole here when we look at Indomitable? That gives you more control, because each time you spend a hold, it's like an automatic 10+ for a single action.<br/><br/>Now, on this particular front, my problem with roll+4 for violence to start with, especially without working really hard to get it is this:<br/>Do we really need a character who starts with more expansive violence than the Hardholder? Like Drone Strike Dude or the Orbital Laser Commander or the Psychic Carpet Bomber? Do we really need someone who starts with more control over their violence and less chance of misses than roll+3 gives you? Do we really need someone who starts doing more 5-harm area per attack?<br/><br/>And I dunno. Maybe? Maybe we do? I mean, I look at the Space Marine Mammal (I skimmed over it, didn't get real in-depth) and I see something pretty close to this:<br/>- Pick two stats: you will never get a 10+ with either of them.<br/>- Pick three stats: you will never miss with them.<br/><br/>Also, as I pointed out earlier, the Driver gets this enhancement thing, but never really has the opportunity to expand his violence. I guess he can get the psychic powers although these are also kinda limited -- the gang is the main expansion and the Driver's can't get one. I'm not saying this is some kind of set-in-stone thing, but there's definitely some hard choices to be made if you want to get all three of these aspects maxed out and still do other things (or even if you don't). The Wrangler's got a hard time upping the harm and armour of his dogs until he takes the workspace advance, but that's 5xp in and then you've got all three kinda nailed down, what with sending your dogs after people, getting the +2 enhancement, and then breeding them with +harm and +armour. Plus that workspace option is way more exciting than the stat enhancement. More exciting here than if the Driver has it, too.<br/><br/>It also just feels like a weird choice for this concept. Like, you're a hardass on your own, okay. And then with your dogs by your side, you are more in control of the outcome of the violence you do. Like you dogs are more disciplined and in control than you are? Even a Chopper with disciplined troops still has the same probabilities for controlling the outcome as when he's on his own. Even if these were giant monster dogs, I would still think that's a matter for dealing more harm. I don't so much get the monster-dog vibe, but then again "insectoid" is one of the choices. Dogs controlled through a psychic link, though? Five bodies with one mind? Now that I could buy. I'd look at hard+2 and a +2 bonus when all the psychically-linked bodies work together and think, "yeah, I could see that." But then again, I might still think "start them off at roll+3 and let them raise that later so there's something to shoot for."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413603/#Comment_413603" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T05:38:24+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  5:38AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You realy convinced me that this guy should be a wimp without his pack.

I appreciate having this discussion with you in particular, Patrick, because you lay out your perspectives on things and make an argument for it, and I can see where you're coming from.

Make 3, and in all the most difficult part is how to make work The Concept and The Moves. Create new moves is very difficult.  Basically all finish being some kind of mix between others playbooks moves. <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6354.0" rel="nofollow">The Roadrunne</a>r isn\u2019t really original and what it does isn\u2019t neither.

Works perfect in communities, but is useless outside (which is kind of the idea). With <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6352.0" rel="nofollow">The Freak</a> I try to make something really different and kind of work, but is also very difficult to put in a group. I believe that have a couple of original moves (doesn\u2019t see it in any other playbooks) but is a headache to play. <br/><br/>I was trying to make some kind of \u201cwasteland hunter\u201d and couldn\u2019t decide what stat should be the primary one. Cool, Hard or Sharp. All works perfectly for the concept, which is modify for what stat is primary: If I give it Cool, would be more like a stealth hunter, if I give it Hard would be a more direct, \u201cface to face\u201d kind of hunter, and if I give it sharp could be a mix between both, or someone who trust more in traps that in other skills. Then I should think in the moves, but the moves wouldn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t be the same for each kind of hunter, what it meant that I should make 3 different kind of playbooks base in the same concept.   <br/><br/>I play a Hocus the other day (was with a Driver), and through the roleplaying session I realize that I was actually playing a Touchstone because of his vision of people and the world, and how he was spreading it. The Hocus moves work great for it, but was how I (the player) was focusing it; The Hocus concept is very open, very flexible and that\u2019s what also make it so great. Easily could make someone \u201cweird\u201d and even savage, I decide to play \u201cthe good guy\u201d this time. The Touchstone\u2026 I don\u2019t like it. Had no sense, is kind of a \u201cmunchkin\u201d playbook that only add powerful moves to another playbooks like The Gunlugger to make it more invincible in a battle; and are move that don\u2019t go much with the concept of the character, neither the primary stat; for the concept should be more like Hot than Hard. <br/> <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9cu0IVYfHtiRzNnVjNsSkJ6MlE/edit" rel="nofollow">The Shielbearer</a> had a lot more sense that The Touchstone does. Change Law for Hope and you have a better Touchstone. <br/> <br/>The Wrangler have great potential, but from the concept itself will be an outcast and even in some kind of isolation.  <br/><br/> Is a personal view, but Hard is for Impose when Hot is to Convince (not just seduce). If you create a move that change that (<i>use hard instead of Hot when you try to manipulated somebody</i>) it kind of make the playbook a \u201cbully\u201d, a \u201cdictator\u201d like The Hardholder.<br/>What if the primary stat for The Hardholder would be Hot instead of Hard? Would be someone that convince, seduce and manage the Hold from Words and charisma more than by force.<br/>What if the primary stat for The Hardholder would be Sharp instead of Hard?

For pretty much all of my Apocalypse World characters, I've gone for playing really cool and competent characters that allow me room to manipulate the system in order to get what I/they want. So playing a Battlebabe was all about avoiding the hard-2 and working the odds to be friendly, supportive of others, and good at both action and psychic maelstrom stuff. With that character, yeah, definitely I was trying to avoid his weaknesses in order to get the best possible result for whatever I wanted him to do.<br/><br/>My Brainers have been pretty brutal, cold, and sociopathic, that's more a character-thing I guess than a weakness? Although when one of them got a holding, it immediately started to go downhill and instead of trying to figure out a way to save it, I just kept role-playing him as the same merciless Brainer and that holding wasn't high enough on his priorities, so it fell apart.<br/><br/>My Savvyhead was supposed to be an awesome detective and problem-solver, too, except since he was in love with the Skinner, I intended to play him like a total idiot in that one regard, and let all the work towards being awesome fall apart when she came around. But we didn't get very far into that game, so I didn't end up doing a lot of that.<br/><br/>Usually in AW, I pick my character's goals and then work the system as hard as I can to get them accomplished. I'm totally down to revel in a character's incompetence and weakness, but that tends to happen in other games. Competence in AW hasn't gotten old for me yet (or it hadn't last time I played).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/roBurky" title="roBurky"><img alt="roBurky" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/roBurky">roBurky</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413852/#Comment_413852" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-09T17:36:32+00:00" title="May  9, 2013  5:36PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi. I'm a lurker making their first post. Please let me know if this thread is a bad place for this.<br/><br/>On Sunday I'm going to be running the first session of my own apocalypse world hack. It's something I'm making specifically for this group of players, so they can carry on the characters they invented for a forum role-playing mafiascum-style trust game earlier in the year. It's a scifi/fantasy setting with politically powerful player characters. Adapting AW's very personal scale to one of global reach has been a challenge.<br/><br/>I've made each player their own custom playbook with bits scavenged from the base AW playbooks to try to represent their characters as already established. There's a politician ruler based on hardholder and hoarder. A mercenary/smuggler based on operator and battlebabe. A cyborg messiah based on brainer. A virtual reality provider based on savvyhead and maestro'd.<br/><br/>But there's one character I'm having trouble with finding the right rules to represent, and I'm looking for help.<br/><br/>They're a superstar singer with an enormous global following, and a big emphasis on how their work provides hope and inspiration to the world. I feel like I need a feature to represent them having to deal with that. At first I was considering something based on hocus fortunes or hardholder wealth. But unlike those AW classes, the superstar isn't necessarily going to be knowing and interacting with her fans by name. Second option I've been thinking about is a re-imagining of the operator's gigs, giving fame as the profit instead of barter. Avoiding paparazzi as the obligation. Things like major concerts and video interviews as the paying gigs. But meaningful catastrophes are hard to pin down.<br/><br/>These are the playbooks and rules changes so far:<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0BxUeZ3tzGOm0N1BZdU5FZnpkeDg/edit?pli=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0BxUeZ3tzGOm0N1BZdU5FZnpkeDg/edit?pli=1</a><br/><br/>Any suggestions or thoughts on how to handle a celebrity career or fandom in a *World system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds" title="nerdwerds"><img alt="nerdwerds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/515/nJ7S2QOLDAAGX.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds">nerdwerds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413869/#Comment_413869" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-10T00:29:51+00:00" title="May 10, 2013 12:29AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Any suggestions or thoughts on how to handle a celebrity career or fandom in a *World system?</blockquote>\nWell, musicians have to cancel shows occasionally, usually due to illness or accident.

In order to abstract the dull process of setting up a concert with a live feed, getting permits, arranging security, etc., you have the player use his "Call my agent" move to see if his agent, who is getting 10% of everything he makes, is able to swing it.  On a hit, the concert is set up, no problem; on a miss, the concert is blocked by the government and now a celebrity website is claiming to have sex videos featuring the character and a variety of actresses and his agent is having an ulcer.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413922/#Comment_413922" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-10T19:52:42+00:00" title="May 10, 2013  7:52PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm way late to join this thread, but I'd like to say a huge thanks to nerdwerds and Johnstone for some really intelligent discussion.<br/><br/>I've always had mixed feelings about certain playbook combinations, as well as about most/many of the new playbooks (including Limited Edition and some of the fan playbooks), and this thread has really helped me to understand why.<br/><br/>Here's another factor we haven't discussed yet:<br/><br/>Some playbooks do not include any points of conflict or Situation. (e.g. the Battlebabe)<br/><br/>Some playbooks imply possible points of conflict by handling a rare resource or situation (e.g. how the existence of an Angel implies that there will be some difficult situations with people near death to deal with--the Angel's resources and help are subject to scarcity, after all).<br/><br/>Some playbooks actually generate Situation, by creating points of conflict. The most obvious examples are the Hardholder and the Hocus (and the Operator). <br/><br/>When you have one of the latter in play, a lot of stuff happens just <i>by itself</i>. You pick the character creation options and then you roll the start-of-session moves, and--bam--there's a Situation and some stuff happening. For example, the Hardholder rolls a 7-9 and tells the MC that his holding is subject to retribution this session. Immediately, we have a Situation which must be resolved.<br/><br/>These are really powerful tools. (Although I've never been a game where we've had several of these in play at once: maybe a game with a Hocus, Hardholder, AND Operator would get to be a little too much? I'm not sure.) Anyway, that's another side of playbook design to consider. I get the impression that the occurence of this kind of thing in the original 11 playbooks is pretty well-balanced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413930/#Comment_413930" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-11T06:15:34+00:00" title="May 11, 2013  6:15AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm not tracking personal wealth in this game.

I could/should do a whole long post on +1s alone and probably will at some point, but this tends to end up being really boring. For the game rules to really shine, you want to go from fiction that triggers the mechanics and then have those mechanics generate fiction which takes you back into the story.<br/><br/>Real celebrity tends to work two ways, I've noticed. You can leverage it for money by doing celebrity appearances: you draw people physically or their attention towards a place, another person, or a product, and you get paid for it. This is how every no-talent celebrity makes a living.<br/><br/>But celebrity also creates opportunities. People who would never even deign to give you a chance to seduce/manipulate them will suddenly be interested in meeting with you and hearing your ideas. Places that would never have you as a guest otherwise suddenly send you invites to show up. And people start to be interested in doing you favours, working with you, etc etc.<br/><br/>So, I think something like that would work well for this kind of move. You could go with like specific gigs (being totally literal) and make it like Moonlighting, which leads to specific surplus and consequences (ie, "I am going to work my concert in Tokyo, my talk show appearance, and my book signing this session"). Although DannyK's suggestion for petitions is a good idea.<br/><br/>If it's more a general just roll and we'll see what happens then type move, where you decide whether it's a sex tape or a concert mishap or a stalker attack when the roll fails, I think it would be best to have a beneficial situation result on a 10+ that creates an actual situation in the fiction that creates opportunities for the PC to further their goals. Maybe something like the PC makes long-running plans to leverage that fame and this upkeep move allows you to "skip to the good stuff" where the plan actually starts to work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim" title="RedPilgrim"><img alt="RedPilgrim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RedPilgrim">RedPilgrim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413931/#Comment_413931" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-11T07:04:37+00:00" title="May 11, 2013  7:04AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is something call "Cache" (i don't know the name in english). Is what is use in music industry to determinate the paycheck of the celebrities and for example if they play with somebody else, who goes first as "curtain" and who is the main atraction.<br/> In real life this was the reason why Heaven and Hell (the original Black Sabbath) play before Linking Park. Obviously Black Sabbath had a longest career, but as Hevean and Hell they sold a lot less records than Linking Park, so Linking Park was the main atraction and the legends had to go first to "worm-up" the audience.<br/><br/> The "Cache" also say who goes on top of the tour poster, who is the main atraction.<br/><br/> The paycheck usually includes those songs that are "hits". For every song that was on radio and becomes mainstream, the artist can reclaim more money, if not kind of have to make a show without those songs that are classics for that particular performer (and result in a disappointed audience).<br/> I can't think rigth now (didn't sleep well), but maybe there is a way to put the "Cache" in the moves at the moment of generate a contract.

But maybe the benefits of Artful and Gracious could become benefits from their upkeep move.<br/><br/>So on a hit, the upkeep move generates hold, which can be spent at any time in the session to make an NPC do things like:<br/>- desire to meet you.<br/>- desire to work with you.<br/>- love or admire you.<br/>- give you a gift.<br/><br/>But then this still isn't what you were suggesting about having actual situations in the fiction that give them opportunities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413935/#Comment_413935" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-11T08:33:29+00:00" title="May 11, 2013  8:33AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No that's actually a pretty good idea - it' still generating fiction, still creating opportunities.

Bear with me here, I'm going to digress.   A while ago, there was a talk on the Forge about using Sorceror for Pokemon and someone suggested that you could have minor Pokemon be "freebies" and only use the Contact and Bind mechanics for the big powerful Pokemon.  I argued strenously against this because creating freebies and "utility demons" is really against the spirit of Sorcerer IMHO.  It creates a safe zone that players hang out in as much as possible, if they can solve their problems without having to make scary, exciting rolls that might be very helpful or totally disastrous, they will!  It's a subtle thing, right?

What makes sense, how many stat boosts should you get and what kind? <br/>What do you need to get a cult (because that's harder to do) what playbook with a gang get'S leadership and wich one get's Pack Alpha (that's easier to see) <br/><br/>But what qualifies a playbook to be able to get a Holding? </blockquote>\nOkay, I will try to take a stab at this.<br/><br/>The "default" setup for advancements seems to be: 2 x playbook move, 2 x other playbook move, 2 x special advancement, and 4 x stat increase, with modifications to taste.<br/><br/>But the actual details? I think they follow what "fits" with the playbook. Like, which special moves will this character actually be able to use, and which ones make sense for this character to take. A hard playbook will be able to use a gang and run a holding, but does it fit with the concept? As well, if a playbook already starts with a resource, give them some advances to improve it. A Gunlugger can get a gang and a holding after a few advances and be in a position similar to the Hardholder, but the Hardholder starts off with a slightly better gang and holding and can then improve them with advances, so she is still "thee Hardholder," right?<br/><br/>Actually, let's look at the Gunlugger. The concept here is: always bad at using hot, good at using violence. So, she can get a gang and a holding, for sure, which reflects how she is mostly dependent on hard to get other people to do things. Moonlighting is a good advance to have here too, because it gives yet another option for the character to take an upkeep move and get more tied into the setting--and also shows how the Gunlugger has to threaten people or sell her services.<br/><br/>Backing that up we have a universally negative hot score and no hot bonus in the advances. You can only get a +1 to the three other stats. And the hard+3 option is part of the moves, unlike with the Chopper who gets that as an advance (but then, he has no other Chopper moves he can take, so he is naturally going to be a character with higher stats and fewer moves). So, you have the option here of being a bit more rounded except for hot or having a lot of moves, many of which increase your capacity for violence in ways that +1 more hard does not.<br/><br/>The holding one is kind of interesting, though, since only the Brainer, Chopper, and Gunlugger, and Hocus can get a holding as an advance. Along with the Hardholder, these are the rulers of Apocalypse World, is what Vincent is saying. If you are hard, you can seize control of power. Meanwhile, the Hocus can go from being owned by people to owning them, and the Brainer can go from being the power behind the throne to the throne itself.<br/><br/>Also the Skinner is the only one who can get followers as an advance. Which also says something about the Brainer -- people don't love the Brainer, they only obey if the Brainer is a hard case. Oh and Moonlighting is the easiest of the "upkeep" moves to get maybe because it is also the best?<br/><br/>Some other observations: The Operator is never weird, which fits. The Battlebabe is usually soft, which fits the whole "can really stir up trouble but can't solve it in a straight-up fight" but this isn't mandatory, you can still get okay hard. The Chopper is never uncool. Never (look at that bike!). But with lots of stat bonuses, you can get pretty weird even though you don't start out that way. The Hardholder is never un-hot like the Gunlugger-with-a-holding is. And Angels are never soft and can increase their hard real easy because of Vincent's real-life experience with paramedics.<br/><br/>So, as you can see, they all back up what is thematically important about each playbook, but I don't think there's any hard and fast rules here. The limited edition playbooks shake things up a bunch, like the Quarantine doesn't get new Quarantine moves, but can learn 3 moves from other playbooks, because the old knowledge is lost and he has to learn what he can from Apocalypse World as it is now, I guess? Advancements reinforce the core theme while creating opportunities that might not exist right at character creation but are still optional aspects of or adjacent to the core theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414251/#Comment_414251" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-17T11:57:17+00:00" title="May 17, 2013 11:57AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>However...

Moves are one of the main building-blocks of playbooks and are pretty important.<br/><br/>In my opinion/experience, there are two key elements to consider when writing moves: the fiction and player behaviour.<br/><br/>How a move affects the fiction gets mentioned a lot, and I think most people understand this one. What does a move bring to the fiction? How does it guide and shape the fiction? Moves are where the dice come in and change the trajectory of where the fiction is going, not only deciding which player's vision is the one that prevails, but also demanding certain concessions from each and every player, even the MC.<br/><br/>The kind of advice I don't see that often though is that moves shape player behaviour, even though this is pretty basic game design. It's not just about the fiction \u2013 moves also change the way players behave, and moves should encourage behaviour that supports both the specific playbook they belong to, but also the game itself, and discourage dissenting behaviour.<br/><br/>So, examples. Let's talk about +1s.<br/><br/>The general rule is that +1s suck because they are boring, they don't add anything to the fiction, etc. In many cases, this is quite true, but not always.<br/><br/>The worst kind of +1 is a move that after rolling the dice gives you a +1 with no connecting fiction and no fictional reason. So, something like this:<br/><br/>Battle Frenzy<br/>When you go into battle, roll+hard. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend your hold, 1-for-1, to:<br/>* Inflict +1 harm when you inflict harm.<br/>* Take +1 to act under fire, go aggro, or seize by force.<br/>* Take -1 harm when you suffer harm.<br/><br/>This move doesn't look especially bad or broken or anything, and you might think it's even a good way to play a barbarian berserker type character, but the thing is: it adds absolutely nothing to the fiction. The trigger is something you are doing anyways and not something you do specifically to receive the benefits of this move, and the results of this move don't add any fiction because they describe only mechanical results. Not only does it not add any fiction in and of itself, it also doesn't encourage the player to add anything extra to the fiction.<br/><br/>Ideally, in a fiction-first game, you want to be in the fiction, trigger a move, roll for it, and then move back into the fiction before you get to another instance where you have to consult the rules and the dice. This is a case where one interaction with the rules directly affects a second interaction with the rules without putting anything on the table to get there. This isn't quite like a move that has a result which demands you act under fire, because in order to determine what the outcome of that roll means, you actually have to decide what acting under fire actually means in the fiction. And it's not really expressing what the battle frenzy is, either. If the move said, "when you frenzy, you inflict +1 harm," that would be a mechanical way of expressing what the battle rage is like. Instead, this move suggests you role-play some battle rage but really just gives you some limited abstract bonuses when you get into some violence. None of it really exists within the fiction.<br/><br/>A move like read a situation (or discern realities), uses a +1 bonus to assist with reincorporation. Instead of getting a flat +1 bonus to another roll, you have to actually use the fiction that the +1 is attached to, to reincorporate something that was brought up earlier. Even if you act on it right away, you're still reincorporating something that someone else contributed, which connects both fiction and behaviour. It encourages players to use each other's contributions to the fiction. This is similar to how FATE operates, tagging certain elements of the fiction with a bonus in order to encourage reincorporation later (and there's a lot of room here for more AW/FATE hybrids, especially for people who don't like skills or Fudge dice).<br/><br/>You can also use a +1 to encourage behaviours other than reincorporation. Take, for example, the Halfling Fighter racial move from Dungeon World. You get +1 to defy danger when you use your small size as an advantage. Since this is a game where you advocate for your character's success, usually when you do something dangerous you are looking to succeed at it, so you want that +1 to your roll. You look at your sheet and you can see right there how to get it: by talking about how your character is a halfling! It is a perfect confluence of encouraging behaviours that support the game and push it forward: playing your character as a protagonist, doing dangerous things, and being a fantasy hero.<br/><br/>To bring it around full circle, it is also entirely possible to create rules that don't require you to add anything to the fiction but still influence player behaviour. But you don't need moves to do this \u2013 the stats do this already. You don't need to say your character is hot even if you have hot+2, even though most people assume that's what it means. But really all it means is you get a +2 bonus when a move says to roll+hot. Which means you will probably do a bunch of roll+hot stuff, because you want you character to succeed at things. But stats don't take up game time the way moves do. They just sit there on the character sheet until you have to use them for something else, they don't require you to roll for things that don't add to the fiction.<br/><br/>So: Just because something involves +1 bonuses or whatever, doesn't mean it is bad. It's all about how it influences player behaviour and how it encourages players to contribute to the fiction, because if a +1 can do that effectively, it doesn't need to add anything all on its own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.Jay" title="C.Jay"><img alt="C.Jay" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.Jay">C.Jay</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414748/#Comment_414748" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-26T00:04:57+00:00" title="May 26, 2013 12:04AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to be such a brown nose with nothing in particular to contribute, but Johnstone, that was one seriously rocking post.

So the idea is that even if the move isn't itself actively bringing new things to the fiction, where the bonus comes from can inspire the player to bring certain things into the fiction that support the unique image of the character (being a halfling etc). I confess I've made at some of those <i>Battle Frenzy</i> style moves, and I think at least one is still floating around inside of Avatar World.<br/><br/>In that case, what of unconditional stat-substitution for basic moves? Like the Battlebabe's <i>Ice Cold</i>, where you Go Aggro with Cool instead of Hard. It doesn't add any new action to the fiction beyond what the Basic Move was already was adding, but isn't providing an incentive for bringing focus to those specific parts of the character persay. If I were to guess it would be that it brings in the possibility of said Basic Move back into possibility for a character who normally would not use it due to low chance of success. What difference is there for saying "roll Basic Move X with Stat Y instead of Stat Z" vs "+1 (or +2 maybe) when you roll Basic Move X"? Is it really just a different kind of "+1ing" move in the end? This isn't talking about stat-substitution moves with conditions such as the Maestro D's one where you can substitute while using a blade since it IS inspiring a certain type of play that would adhere with the character image desired by taking the move.<br/><br/>The other thing I'm really wondering about is what considerations a person should have in mind for how to keep moves from breaking the game when taken by other playbooks (via the "move from another playbook" advancement). I kinda struggle with this one.<br/><br/>Great stuff in this thread as a whole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414754/#Comment_414754" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-26T03:03:05+00:00" title="May 26, 2013  3:03AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, unconditional stat-substitution moves are boring as shit for exactly the reasons you mention. All they do is get a player to use a basic move because now they will succeed on it. Conditional stat moves are good. They do what conditional +1s do, AND they also encourage having a high rating in a specific stat. Which might be good or maybe not, depending on the game. A stat-sub move CAN be interesting when a stat has more than one basic move, like Ice Cold modifies Go Aggro, but your Seize by Force roll is still really bad. So the Battlebabe's style of violence is still differentiated from that of the Gunlugger.<br/><br/>Also terrible is writing a playbook that has an unconditional stat-sub move that is objectively better than a previous stat-sub move that was conditional (helloooo Touchstone!). Gee, I wonder which one I will take when I take a move from another playbook?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414755/#Comment_414755" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-26T03:16:14+00:00" title="May 26, 2013  3:16AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2013 3:26PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The other thing I'm really wondering about is what considerations a person should have in mind for how to keep moves from breaking the game when taken by other playbooks (via the "move from another playbook" advancement). I kinda struggle with this one.</blockquote>\nThe easiest way is if you're working with a limited set of playbooks, like the original 11, or the 8 from DW, or like you assume a defined set will be the default in a specific setting (like the 6 from Inverse World, or 8 if they reach that stretch goal I guess). You can examine them all and just not assume responsibility for options outside that set.<br/><br/>Another tactic would be to add explicit limits on types of bonuses, maybe. Like, there's two different +1 harm moves in the original 11 AW playbooks, but if you throw in all the fan-made ones there are undoubtedly others, and you could end up with a character eventually doing +4 harm with every attack. So just add a rule that says if you have multiple moves giving a bonus to the same thing, they don't stack. So you can only get +1 harm max, no matter how many moves. This might work better with Dungeon World's setup, because you can take the +1d4 damage move, and then replace it with the +1d8 damage move, but you can't take the +1d8 damage move unless you've already taken the +1d4 damage move, so it's a legitimate way to get the +1d8 when a rule says you can't stack two +1d4 damage moves.<br/><br/>And if you use conditional moves, players would still want to take multiple moves, like +1d4 damage if you're fighting a magical foe and +1d4 damage if you've lost half your hit points or something. You don't get +2d4 damage if you've lost half you're hit points and you're fighting a wizard, but having both still gives you that +1d4 a lot more often than just having one does.<br/><br/>Consider it an expansion of the Singleton Rule from Monsterhearts. Or another version of Scopes from Diaspora.<br/><br/>(And you could go further with scopes and say you can get one bonus from moves, one from other people, one from a weapon or item, one from magic, one from situation or temporary bonuses ie +1 forward, etc.)<br/><br/>There's still plenty of ways that mixing and matching can get out-of-hand gonzo, but that I think would handle the really obvious stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414794/#Comment_414794" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T14:29:10+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  2:29PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2013 4:29AM by Johnstone.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, some more. This is a thing that really bugs me: "auto-parley" moves.<br/><br/>You see it mostly in Dungeon World playbooks, with the parley move instead of in Apocalypse World with the manipulate move, where a special move says "you can always use X thing as leverage to parley." An Arresting Skinner is another version of this move, except without relying on a roll or anything. The basic premise here is that you will always be able to parley with NPCs. So, for example:<br/><br/>Beat You Up!<br/>You can always use the threat of you beating someone up as leverage to parley with them.<br/><br/>So basically, the effect that this has is: every single NPC in the game is afraid of you beating them up. Whether or not you actually choose to parley with all of them or not is beside the point\u2014at any time, you can choose to indicate that an NPC is afraid of being beaten up by you.<br/><br/>Why is this a problem? Because you're giving the player a hammer and turning all the NPCs into nails.<br/><br/>In a game like Apocalypse World, everyone is human. There's a limited range of setting and genre there, and even then the auto-parley move puts some serious constraints on the types of NPCs the GM can introduce. But in a game like Dungeon World, you're supposed to have the entire palette of the fantasy genre available to you. So now you've got deities, giant dragons, demons, emotionless ghosts, robots, and who knows what else all afraid of being beaten up by this PC, even when it is impossible for the PC to beat them up! It strains credulity, sure (why are these crazy powerful being afraid of being beaten up? you put them in the game for some impact, some gravitas, and then a single move just drains it away), but more importantly it creates one optimal path that is always open, which makes other options less likely to be considered. End result: it encourages a boring game with the same stuff happening over and over again. The GM can no longer introduce a variety of different NPCs, with varying motivations and desires. In the face of this PC, they all become the same.<br/><br/>And I use the threat of being beaten up for comedic effect, but the issue is the same even if we go with something else, like:<br/><br/>Meistersinger<br/>You can always use the power and beauty of your songs as leverage to parley.<br/><br/>Okay, so now you can just sing your way out of any conflict with any NPC. Assuming you roll good anyway. But this still removes a sizeable opportunity for role-playing. The GM can't decide what the NPC is like, and there's no incentive for the PC to actually find out what they're like and what kind of leverage would be useful in manipulating them.<br/><br/>This might be partially encouraged by the basic moves. In AW, you use read a sitch primarily in order to find out what course of action would be most beneficial (hence the +1 bonus for reincorporation), but you use read a person (and open your brain) in order to get information that allows you to make moves where you couldn't make moves before. In other words, you read a person to find out what you can use for leverage, and then you can manipulate them with it, instead of just taking a stab in the dark and coming up empty. This means more investment in the NPC, and more time (on the part of the players) getting to know them. Dungeon World combines these into discern realities, and the move that creates new opportunities to make moves is spout lore, which does a lot less to encourage interaction with NPCs. And the discern realities questions are of the read-a-sitch variety (or the locational variety, which is a bit odd because according to the trigger you can't use the move on a location per se) and not the read-a-person variety.<br/><br/>AW has moves like An Arresting Skinner, of course, and playbooks like the Solace, that dictate the emotional reactions of other characters. But these is pretty rare, and also a Big Deal when it happens (and playbooks that do this by default are pretty disruptive, I would say selfish, just like I did at the start of this thread). The basic moves are a different story. You'll notice the last seize by force option is "impress, dismay, or frighten your enemy." So we know they are impacted somehow, but the MC still has leeway to actually role-play the NPC and decide what their specific, actual reaction is. If they don't feel fear, they can still be impressed. If they are completely dead inside, they can still be dismayed. This is definitely not in the auto-parley category, because it's still up to the GM's judgment\u2014the rules just narrow things down.<br/><br/>Okay, so two peripheral issues. One: what if your GM never thinks your character has leverage to parley? An auto-parley move fixes that! Yes. So does getting a new GM who will be a fan of the characters. If you say your character is the greatest singer in the land and he only ever meets NPCs who hate music, somebody is being a jerk instead of a fan. Most NPCs should be interested in your character's singing. Then when one shows up who isn't, it's a Big Deal. Instead of all of them all the time, which either way becomes boring.<br/><br/>And two is perhaps the counter-point that, well, the GM can just do that anyway. Except this is a terrible counter-point because technically no they can't, unless either they are breaking the rules or that line that says you can always use X to parley is just a suggestion. In which case why is it there in the first place then? If I want to re-skin the Ranger so I can play Afro-Galactus riding around on the Silver Surfer's borrowed board, I can do that my own damn self. I don't need a suggestion from somebody else to decide my Druid is actually a four-piece Japanese metal band. I need rules that actually make it interesting to play those characters. And throwing around those auto-parley moves, instead of saving them for something really crazy (like one move out of 11 playbooks crazy), makes play less interesting, not more.<br/><br/>If the caveat to an auto-parley move is that it's the GM's prerogative to ignore it and disallow leverage when it makes sense then it's not a real rule, it's just a suggestion. Because it's already the GM's job to allow leverage when it makes sense and deny leverage when it doesn't make sense\u2014and to do so while being a fan of the character. Which makes it not a valid choice. Either you can trust the GM to be a fan when role-playing NPCs or you can't, and by phrasing it as a rule, you're kind of saying that you can't ("you" being the game designer). And if I have to break the rules in order to make something be interesting, then the rules aren't very good, are they? No. I think they can be better.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Note: It's also possible to do this with other methods than just parley. Like Bend Bars, Lift Gates allows you to break anything, so you have a thing you can do at any point during the game unless the GM has put you in a dungeon made of flesh. This is why I call it probably the most powerful move in the game (well, of the base 8 classes anyway): because you always have an opportunity to use it. If you got a problem, yo I'll solve it. Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it I BREAK IT (also: fewer consequences than the Faceless version of the move). Is this as egregious as NPCs always reacting in one set fashion, though? I say no, maybe you say yes.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414813/#Comment_414813" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T05:43:14+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  5:43AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thank you Johnstone!

It has a drawback on a miss, of course, but you've still diffused a violent situation! They can only beat YOU up. It's also weird in that it's basically pass/fail, not a three-way outcome.<br/><br/>Okay, one good thing about these two moves, as far as AW goes, is that they break down any status quo thing the MC has going on. They don't allow it. But otherwise, it can get kind-of boring if a player uses them ALL THE TIME, even though I don't think too many players will abuse it.<br/><br/>I think you are right that you can use a sort-of auto-parley move in Dungeon World by limiting the effect. You could go with all sorts of caveats for an emotional effect, like (in order of narrowest to broadest):<br/>-- it only affects other members of your race<br/>-- it only affects other people from your society<br/>-- it only affects other civilized* people (or other barbarian* people)<br/>-- it only affects other intelligent creatures, except that this is the default because you can only parley with intelligent creatures anyway.<br/><br/>(*these are pretty loaded terms, though.)<br/><br/>There are also other models for achieving the fictional result that auto-parley moves are tryng to create. So, your example of bringing fun and merriment to people.<br/><br/>1. You could just write that as colour: "You bring fun and merriment to people who need it." And then when you want to parley with your fun and merriment services, you point that line out to the GM and say, "how about it?"<br/><br/>2. Go back to the limits thing, but limit where you can bring it up in the game. Look at the human bard racial move, for example. Maybe you could have a move, like, of the top of my head:<br/><br/>Festivalia<br/>You are a purveyor of fun and merriment and a connesseuer of celebrations. When you arrive at a new settlement, the GM will ask you when the next festival is. If it is soon, someone asks you to participate.<br/><br/>3. Instead of parley, you could use your celebratory ways to cheer someone up as a move, or to diffuse a situation much like Disarming Presence. I would probably do it something like... roll+CHA, and you lighten the mood, but make it more of a choice, like: the first person to spoil the mood gets blamed for everything and everyone else turns on them (this goes for NPCs too). Or maybe, uhm, this is really rough, but maybe the fey version of Disarming Presence could be:<br/><br/>Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy<br/>When you counsel against violence or despair and instead propose to sing a song of joy, tell a funny joke, or otherwise bring celebration to life, roll+CHA. On a 10+, no one can use violence against you. On a 7-9, they can try to drive you away but they cannot try to kill you. On a miss, no one is amused. If any PCs join in your celebrations after you use this move, at the end of the session, they can mark XP.<br/><br/>So obviously it only works on people who can understand you. But hey! Why not try it out when you meet the basilisk? Maybe the GM looks at her monster description and says, sure, roll it and we'll see, and you end up capering through the forest singing songs with a dancing basilisk?!? Awesomesauce!<br/><br/>So yeah. LOTS of different things are possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds" title="nerdwerds"><img alt="nerdwerds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/515/nJ7S2QOLDAAGX.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds">nerdwerds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414880/#Comment_414880" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-28T21:42:19+00:00" title="May 28, 2013  9:42PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But otherwise, it can get kind-of boring if a player uses them ALL THE TIME, even though I don't think too many players will abuse it.</blockquote>\nIn the first one-shot I ran, the Skinner used the <b><i>arresting skinner</i></b> move in almost every situation.

Even though she insisted she wasn't a stripper everybody treated her like one <i>because she was always taking her clothes off to stop a fight from starting</i>. I made a point of this by having a big baddie invite her to dance at  party he was holding and then had a fight break out when she refused to strip which then caused her to use the move.<br/>The only problem I find with that move is that you activate it and it works, no possibility of failure, no possibility of partial success. In much the same way you point out the problem of having a <b><i>Beat You Up!</i></b> move that affects everyone you come into contact with, I find <b><i>An Arresting Skinner</i></b> to be boring because it doesn't actually progress the story or the action, it literally brings everything to an immediate halt. <br/>Plus, it puts the narrative of what happens next solely into one player's hands, and what if they don't know what to do with it?

And maybe a second one, too, or two more. And actually, the whole table comes up with these additional dangers, not just the GM, if you want. And you take one die for the goal and one die for each danger and you roll them all and you assign one die to the goal and one die to each danger, to see what happens.<br/><br/>And the thing is, if the player rolls really good, they achieve their goal and avoid all the dangers. Which means all the creative stuff you just spent the last few minutes discussing is just thrown away! Okay, sure, dangers can stay on the table sometimes (many times, even, but NOT ALWAYS), and sometimes you roll really bad and they all come true, but these rolls happen a lot, and you're usually avoiding something every time. So there's a lot of dangers that you have to come up with that get avoided, and that's the problem. Because when you keep dropping stuff out that you have to expend energy and creativity coming up with, it's not only draining but it takes the focus away from what is really important: what DOES happen next.<br/><br/>(Ghost/Echo is still pretty damn fun, mind you. This is like the one bad thing about it. If you don't know Ghost/Echo do a search of Story Games for threads about it. Don't just follow the link to it.)<br/><br/>And then came Apocalypse World and it was very, very similar. Except that now you could wait until after the roll to invent a hard choice! And so we went back to concentrating on what does happen next and not on what could have but didn't.<br/><br/>And then people started writing moves for the game, and they wrote moves with lists of options to pick from, and they wrote options that said a thing doesn't happen. Okay, so, what happens when you pick a thing from a list and you say it doesn't happen? Well, for one thing, everybody's thinking about it, now. They can't stop thinking about it, which is a distraction when they're supposed to be deciding what DOES happen next. Second, there's uncertainty as to whether the other things that you didn't pick to not happen will happen or not. Does it automatically happen because you didn't pick it not to? It is a mystery! The real answer is no, of course: what happens is the GM's choice. But on a 7-9, they aren't really supposed to make a hard move, so it's like, what to do, what to do?<br/><br/>So hopefully you can see why it is more advantageous to write positive options, which state that things DO happen? When you have to pick X options that DON'T happen -- instead of the move saying "pick 1, that happens, move on," which is good and keeps things rolling along at a steady pace -- you can end up stalled. You go into the moves in order to add uncertainty, yes, but also to guide you towards certain types of outcomes, and dictating the terms of what a player can describe after the roll is part of that. You want a move to be a machine\u2014you put a fictional action into one end of it, roll some dice, and it spits out the limits that you have to abide by when describing things. Inspiration likes limitations, but things you can't do are like the edges of a blank piece of paper. Your inspiration is better off starting with a drawing of anything on that piece of paper than worrying about its size and dimensions.<br/><br/>Dictating elements that must be included propels the game forward because you use them as inspiration and build off of them. Negative options are constraints that you have to struggle to get away from. They aren't constraints you can riff off of. They just drain energy and creativity over the course of a game, and this is true even if you don't have to spend the energy to invent the things that don't happen yourself, just not as bad.<br/><br/>tl;dr: Write moves that produce fiction, or that influence the players to create fiction, or that spur characters into action in the fiction. Stay away from moves that shut down options without also doing one of these things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415094/#Comment_415094" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T00:53:04+00:00" title="May 31, 2013 12:53AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>tl;dr: Write moves that produce fiction, or that influence the players to create fiction, or that spur characters into action in the fiction.

I agree that they are not as efficient as positive, fiction-generating, consequences but they do help give me as a GM specific prompts associated with specific moves. Saying that the GM can make as hard a move as they like is not really the same thing as it leans harder on the GM.<br/><br/>rgds<br/>rob<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415095/#Comment_415095" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T00:59:04+00:00" title="May 31, 2013 12:59AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, that's a thing.

And those examples vary in how bring-the-pain they are.<br/>In fact, none of the playbooks written by Vincent Baker have moves that use the phrasing to "make as hard a move as you like" for their description of rolling a miss. So perhaps we should chalk up this phrasing as the individual authors of moves either not properly directing the fiction of the move or not wanting to tie the MC's move down in one particular direction.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415100/#Comment_415100" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T02:47:46+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  2:47AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Saying that the GM can make as hard a move as they like is not really the same thing as it leans harder on the GM.</blockquote>\nI disagree with this sentence.

Even though I know I've seen moves written like that before. I suspect this might be just a placeholder phrase for a move when somebody is working on and discussing a custom playbook in a forum thread, and it eventually gets edited into something more substantial.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415102/#Comment_415102" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T02:54:41+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  2:54AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sure, that's a thing.

Cool, this is what I'm talking about. It has an advantage in that one of those choices is "stuff happens now" but then there's the other two.<br/><br/>I feel like there might be some kind of nuance to Vincent's original, but honestly I'm having a hard time finding it. Maybe I'm missing something. Here's my breakdown of the 7-9:<br/><br/>If you choose "they do it," does that mean that they fight back AND you have to make an example of one of them? Or does the MC get to decide whether either of these two happen? Remember: you don't get to make a hard move on a 7-9, unless the 7-9 result directs you to, and then it's a specific move. Although fighting back ca neasily be a soft move, if you just describe it and say "what do you do?" So there's that.<br/><br/>If you choose "they don't fight back," then what happens? You have to make an example of one of them and they still don't do what you want? That's one shitty 7-9 result. Or maybe it means that they do it once you make an example of one of them? In which case why would you ever choose "they do it," when presumable both consequences will happen?<br/><br/>Same deal with "you don't have to make an example of one of them." Does it mean that they fight back AND won't do what you want them to? Or does it just mean once they're done fighting back, as long as you've won, they go back to doing what you want?<br/><br/>For me, there's a lot of implication, but not enough guidance. I guess I feel like it leaves the MC a lot of room to decide what the gang does but that it also leaves a lot of room to really screw with what is supposed to be, fundamentally, a success. Or that's what the rules say about 7-9 results, anyway.<br/><br/>What if we reword it a little? Is there something the original has that this version lacks?<br/><br/>Nouveau Pack Alpha: When you impose your will on your gang, roll+hard.<br/>On a 10+, they do what you want.<br/>On a 7-9, choose 1 and deal with it before they do what you want:<br/>* They fight back over it.<br/>* You have to make an example of one of them.<br/>On a miss, one of them makes a concerted effort to replace you as pack alpha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds" title="nerdwerds"><img alt="nerdwerds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/515/nJ7S2QOLDAAGX.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds">nerdwerds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415110/#Comment_415110" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T05:37:43+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  5:37AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Nouveau Pack Alpha: When you impose your will on your gang, roll+hard.<br/>On a 10+, they do what you want.<br/>On a 7-9, choose 1 and deal with it before they do what you want:<br/>* They fight back over it.<br/>* You have to make an example of one of them.<br/>On a miss, one of them makes a concerted effort to replace you as pack alpha.</blockquote>\nThe first character I played was a Chopper and I hated the Pack Alpha move! <br/>It doesn't feel like a move, in play it feels like a limitation. I would deliberately not choose "they do what you want" because I was often just following the threat impulse of my gang so they would fight with as little resistance as possible. Most of the inter-gang conflict ended up being about stupid bullshit rather than actual goals of the collective , which I suppose replicated what being in charge of a gang is really like anyway but my point is that the way I played my character we were effectively using Pack Alpha the way you describe it here. I didn't miss on the roll very often, but I did make examples of plenty of my gang members along the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415111/#Comment_415111" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T05:48:22+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  5:48AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So if it was worded my way it wouldn't have made a difference to the way your game turned out?<br/><br/>Also, looking back on it, do you think you had to impose your will too often?

One of the most epic sessions was one where I let my gang run off and create mayhem without me so I didn't have to worry about trying to bend them to my will.\n<blockquote>Also, looking back on it, do you think you had to impose your will too often?

In the early sessions of the game I rolled lots of 10+ results so I think she forced me to roll Pack Alpha for lots of things with my gang just because it created more risk.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415113/#Comment_415113" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T06:00:36+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  6:00AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>If you choose "they don't fight back," then what happens?

Just like seize by force means you take harm, even on a 10+.<br/>That makes the move like a "tell the consequences and ask", if a player wants to go that route there will be pain.<br/><br/>I agree that there is a lot of stuff rolled into the move and the way that you read it.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415116/#Comment_415116" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T06:59:31+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  6:59AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But doesn't that mean on a 7-9, not only do you fail to make them do what you want, but you have to make an example of one of them just in order to keep your gang?

Johnstone, I am totally with you on the "negative" options moves, they generally aren't as good as the positive ones. (Not to mention that the double negative inherent in choosing a negative not to happen sometimes makes it hard to figure out what's actually going on.)<br/><br/>I like your re-write of the <i>pack alpha</i> move, although it's far more forgiving than the original. I suppose part of the problem with the move, though (and probably why you rewrote it the way you did) is that it's not clear why you'd have to make an example of one of them if they weren't fighting back. It's also possible that the option to choose to back down (choose not to have them do it) is an interesting choice, telling us a lot about how the Chopper interacts with his gang (sometimes he bows to them, instead).<br/><br/>Implied in the move is a pretty harsh reality: even on a 7-9 (which is a success, remember), the Chopper doesn't get his way. That suggests that what the move is really about is, "Can the Chopper remain the leader of his gang?" On a 7-9, this is still a success, not a failure (while your intent for what you wanted may have failed). I'd say this a pretty rough move when it's about one of the basic things the character has (his gang), so my inclination as MC would be not to call for it too often, but rather under dramatic and/or dire circumstances.<br/><br/>I'll try a rewrite, just as a draft (I haven't put much thought into it), and just for the purpose of discussion. It's much more here-hold-my-hand-and-I'll-guide-you-through-this, which could be good or bad.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>When your gang refuses to do as you say, you can impose your will on them to force them back into line. Roll+hard.<br/>On a 10+, they do what you want.<br/>On a 7-9, you haven't lost them yet, but there's trouble. Choose two:<br/>* They refuse to do this thing you're asking of them.<br/>* They fight back.<br/>* You have to make an example of a key member of the gang if you want them to ever listen to you again.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>That's functionally equivalent to Vincent's original move.<br/><br/>I like the simplicity of your version, though. I feel that the whole "do they do it or not?" thing is potentially kind of redundant, since the choice is already built into "they fight back" and "you have to make an example of one of them": if you lose the fight or aren't willing to make an example of one of them, of course they won't do what you want. It seems that choice is already in there, why include it as an option in the move?<br/><br/>Let's break it down, just for fun.<br/><br/>In the original, your options on a 7-9 are:<br/><br/>* They do what you want, but first you have to fight and you'll have to kill one of them.<br/>* They don't do what you want, and you've got a fight on your hands.<br/>* They don't do what you want, and you'll have to make an example of one of them (presumably to keep control of the gang).<br/><br/>I think my options are the same, unless I screwed up somewhere.<br/><br/>(By the way, the second one sure looks like a miss, doesn't it?)<br/><br/>In your version, the options are:<br/><br/>* They fight you over it first [but then they do it].<br/>* Once you make an example of one of them, they do it.<br/><br/>This seems to fit the typically framework of a 7-9 (success with a price or complication) much better. <br/><br/>I guess we're missing out on situations where the Chopper has a power struggle and/or kills someone to keep control, but the gang doesn't do what he says. (Either because they still refuse for some reason -- "Ok, ok, boss, no one's challenging your authority here - well, except for Balls here, but he's dead now - but we ain't going in there, no way" -- or because the Chopper has decided to cede to their demands -- "Balls is dead. I'll let it go this time, but you refuse me again and another one of you snuffs it.")<br/><br/>That can't happen under the new move. <br/><br/>Those situations are potentially interesting, I think. I also imagine they almost never come up in play! (Largely because "they fight back" and "you have to make an example out of on of them" can look pretty similar, perhaps: I'm not sure how strong the incentive is not to take both at the same time. Yeah, I can choose not to kill one of them, but they're going to fight me anyway, so chances are someone's life is on the line anyway. How different is that? Might as well take both, in exchange for actually getting what you want out of the conflict. Then again, if you've got the whole gang named and known - so no death will be meaningless - and their numbers are dwindling, so any death will have consequences you will feel keenly, then the choice becomes more interesting.) <br/><br/>(I suppose a corrolary principle might be for the MC to pick someone important and/or very useful/irreplaceable when the player chooses the "make an example of someone" option. The move's totally silent on whether the MC should do this, or if the player can just say, "Ok, I'll bash in the head of... that dude at the back who never pulls his weight anyway." That's why I modified the "make an example" a little in my rewrite. I wonder if it would help or just be some redundant garbage wording weighing down the move.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415453/#Comment_415453" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T11:26:02+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 11:26AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2013 11:42AM by Johnstone.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like it, Paul, and it's not functionally equivalent. The nuance you're missing with your version is that on a 7-9, if I choose the "they do what you want" option, it is NOT a given that they fight back or that I have to make an example of them -- those are choices for the MC to make. With your move the MC does not make that choice, instead you have already made it for them and chosen the worst possible outcome for the PC.\n<blockquote>I guess we're missing out on situations where the Chopper has a power struggle and/or kills someone to keep control, but the gang doesn't do what he says. (Either because they still refuse for some reason -- "Ok, ok, boss, no one's challenging your authority here - well, except for Balls here, but he's dead now - but we ain't going in there, no way" -- or because the Chopper has decided to cede to their demands -- "Balls is dead. I'll let it go this time, but you refuse me again and another one of you snuffs it.")<br/><br/>That can't happen under the new move. </blockquote>\nOf course it can, that's what misses are for. Someone makes a bid to take you out and once you deal with it, you still don't have a 7+ that says they do what you want.<br/><br/>Here's a few things that don't quite make sense to me (and this could always segue into thoughts on action resolution vs scene resolution vs upkeep, or maybe we don't need to get into that yet):<br/><br/>When Patrick (nerdwerds) talks about not picking "they do what you want" because they were already more or less doing what he wanted them to do, it doesn't really make a lot of sense to me why he was rolling for the move in the first place. I wasn't there so I dunno the actual circumstances, but to me, the move is for getting the gang to do something they don't want to do, so the idea that you wouldn't pick they do it when you know the MC is going to make trouble is ridiculous. To me.<br/><br/>Also, if you do pick "they do it" and the MC decides they fight back, when does this fighting back happen? Because you picked they do it, so they have to do it. If the fighting back has to get resolved before they do it, then it might not happen and that is chiseling and weaseling the player out of the full benefit of their move. So if they're going to fight back later, why do I (as MC) need the move to tell me this? I can just decide, later on, that they fight back over what they had to do. It's just a soft move, same as any. "They're pissed over it, yelling and shoving. They're looking for a fight, and you're the most convenient authority figure. What do you do?"<br/><br/>And there's the same kind of thing with making an example. Do you have to make an example of someone before they will do it? Is this what happens when you pick "they don't fight back"? Do you have to make an example of someone after they do it, just to keep them together, or what? This is one of the problems with negative choices -- you assumed one thing about the move, somebody else assumed something totally different, some of us are just really confused about what is actually supposed to be going on. If I play a Chopper, I literally have no idea what the MC is going to do with this move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415455/#Comment_415455" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T11:46:07+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 11:46AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2013 12:10PM by Johnstone.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is what I consider a more complete breakdown of the options when a 7-9 is rolled for pack alpha:<br/><br/>You choose "they do it" and the MC says...<br/>- okay they do it.<br/>- okay but they fight back over it (before, during, or after they do it).<br/>- okay but you have to make an example out of one of them (before, so that, during, or after they do it).<br/>- okay but they fight back AND you have to make an example out of one of them.<br/><br/>You choose "they don't fight back" and the MC says...<br/>- okay and they do it or they only sort-of do it.<br/>- okay but they still refuse to do it.<br/>- okay but you have to make an example of one of them (so that they do it, don't fight back, or something else).<br/><br/>You choose "you don't have to make an example out of one of them" and the MC says...<br/>- okay and they do it or they only sort-of do it.<br/>- okay but they still refuse to do it.<br/>- okay but they do fight back and they still refuse to do it.<br/>- okay but they fight back if you still make them do it.<br/>- okay and they do it but they fight back about it later.<br/>And probably a few more possibilities, but this one is so fucking confusing I just don't know!<br/><br/>Blegh! It's too much bullshit! The way I compress it, you have a simple choice: If you want to make them do something they don't want to do, on a 7-9, you either put up with them "fighting back," whatever that means (could be fisticuffs, could be a heated argument, could be chainswords!), or you show them there are consequences and you make an example of one of them (which doesn't mean killing them, you might only need to belittle them verbally, or stab out an eye). Or, of course, you can throw up your hands and say fuck it, fine, do whatever it is you're going to do, I'm not willing to fight over this.<br/><br/>And if shit happens later, even during the same scene, that's up to the MC.<br/><br/>I think there's definitely room for more and less brutal versions of the move, it's the uncertainty over what is actually supposed to happen, and how that choice actually happens, that I think needs to be eliminated from the wording.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/benhamill" title="benhamill"><img alt="benhamill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/benhamill">benhamill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415462/#Comment_415462" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T12:49:53+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 12:49PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't agree that the MC has a choice in the matter with Pack Alpha.

Your gang is going to do what you want but do you make an example out of one of them first, fight all of them first, or do both.

The move is for orders that contradict the gang\u2019s instincts or strong self-interests.<br/><br/>If the gang fights back over it, as MC you have a choice: (1) summarize the fight. They just inflict harm as normal, determined by their weapons and your armor (you can have them choose not to go all the way with their weapons, if the circumstances don\u2019t call for a full-on battle). Or else (2) zoom in on the fight, playing it out in full, with the chopper making moves and the gang making moves, and attending to all the consequences of all of the moves they make.<br/><br/>If the chopper makes an example of one of them, that means inflicting harm as normal, determined by her weapon and the gang member\u2019s armor. But it better be enough to really make an example.<br/><br/>Just to lay it right out: on a 7\u20139, the player\u2019s choices are (1) they do what you want, after a fight in which they beat the shit out<br/>of you but you make an example of one of them; (2) they don\u2019t do what you want, but you make an example of one of them<br/>and so they don\u2019t beat the shit out of you; (3) you don\u2019t make an example of one of them, so they beat the shit out of you and<br/>don\u2019t do what you want.<br/><br/>\u201cMakes a dedicated bid\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201ctakes on as an allconsuming life goal\u201d or anything like that. It just means one<br/>fully intent challenge to the character\u2019s authority.</blockquote>\nSo that's where I'm coming from (with my re-write).<br/><br/>A strong counter-argument, however, is that a move should be written so that a few paragraphs of explanatory text shouldn't be necessary to use it right.

So that's an inconsistency: the game says things work like X, then you get to the moves and some work like Y. The game should tell you about Y as well as X. This is a thing I really, really noticed while writing a game last year. That's more a rules text issue than a playbook issue, though.<br/><br/>The other issue has to do with scene resolution moves, which is something I should probably write more about. It's been discussed around here back when custom moves were the most popular thing. Basically, they are good for scenes that nobody really cares about enough to actually play through in full but we want to know what happens because of them -- like scrounging in the ruins, above, or most of Dungeon World's special moves (make camp, perilous journey, carouse, supply, recruit hirelings, etc). But if you have too many too often you end up playing a GM-less game where you just talk about what happens to the characters instead of inhabiting the character and doing perspective taking and acting and stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds" title="nerdwerds"><img alt="nerdwerds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/515/nJ7S2QOLDAAGX.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds">nerdwerds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415578/#Comment_415578" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T03:35:08+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  3:35AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2013 3:35AM by nerdwerds.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One issue I briefly mentioned is that the rules say stuff like "a 7-9 is fundamentally a success" and "you only make hard moves on a miss or when they give you the opportunity" and then when Vincent explains the move, neither of those are true -- a 7-9 is just as bad as a miss, maybe worse even.

To me, a lot of the text reads like a "How to GM effectively" manual, from the agenda and the principles all the way down to the MC's moves. Apocalypse World succeeds because it's approachable to a newbie, but it also reads as a sly wink to anybody whose been role-playing for years.<br/><br/>I think this "a 7-9 is fundamentally a success" concept is essentially why moves like <b><i>pack alpha</i></b> feel incongruous. A 7-9 on <b><i>pack alpha</i></b> is clearly not a success, unless you change the way it's written (hack it) or simply ignore that first option. I still fall back on treating that first option as "they don't half-ass it" instead of "they do what you want," but I have yet to MC a chopper in any game I've MCed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415614/#Comment_415614" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T13:53:44+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  1:53PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to play Devil's Advocate here for a moment, is it that different from <i>act under fire</i>, where, if the MC offers you a hard choice, a valid choice can be "you don't succeed"? <br/><br/>Both moves might be a little different, also, because they tend to be triggered by difficult situations you could try to avoid yourself (as opposed to other moves which you can trigger when you want to do something, like open your brain or go aggro or manipulate).<br/><br/>Anyway, this is one reason why I DO like Johnstone's re-write of the move, above (success is built in on a 7-9).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18311/apocalypse-world-writing-playbooks/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18311/apocalypse-world-writing-playbooks">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18311/apocalypse-world-writing-playbooks/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18311/apocalypse-world-writing-playbooks/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18311/apocalypse-world-writing-playbooks/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18311%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18311%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
