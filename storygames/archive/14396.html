When is it not?  <br/><br/>What's the difference between publishing a system hack and publishing a system hacked together from several other systems (is the former tribute and the latter plagiarism)?<br/><br/>If you look around, many systems have direct mechanics taken or influenced from another, I'm trying to determine how far is too far.  I'm also assuming you're giving the original game credit for these mechanics at the end of your text.<br/><br/>Context for my question - I'm working on a Fantasy game and pretty much straight up stole Graham's Occupation and Insanity Die rules from Cthulhu Dark (Insanity Die is a Power Die in my rules for Mages).<br/><br/>I also took some other stuff but one example is enough.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327020/#Comment_327020" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T07:12:50+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  7:12AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2011 7:13AM by Ry.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Get to a point where you have a serious, playtestable draft, and include your list of references at the back.

This is not legal advice. That said, I know IP lawyers who are gamers and unofficially have mentioned:<br/><br/>- Games mechanics, including those in RPGs, can indeed be patented under US Patent Law.<br/><br/>- Generally, when it comes to patents, the lines between RPGs, Boardgames, and even video / mobile games that use similar mechanics are becoming increasingly blurred. It is very common to patent game mechanics in video and mobile games. This will become an increasing issue as RPGs and Boardgames migrate to digital devices such as tablets and eReaders. Patents for game mechanics also exist in Boardgames. Wizards of the Coast has at least 1 patent for game mechanics in Magic the Gathering.<br/><br/>- To be awarded a patent, the idea must technically be new, innovative, and non-obvious. It would be difficult to patent the vast majority of RPG mechanics because very few are new or proving they are new would be difficult. But ideas that shouldn't be patented sometimes get through the patent system. <br/><br/>- Just because you have a patent, doesn't mean you have a strong patent that will be enforceable in court. Some say that the prequalification system for obtaining patents is broken. Often you don't know how valuable your patent is till it is challenged in court. <br/><br/>- Please note, patents protect ideas. Copyrights protect the expression of ideas. Trademarks protect names, words, phrases, logos, symbols, designs, images, or a combination of these elements. <br/><br/>- The common statement that "RPG mechanics can't be patented" is false. <br/><br/>- But are those patents worth it? And how much do those patents protect you? Are you going to make enough money to make spending money to protect your patent worth it? The best protection is lots of money and hiring professionals to investigate all the angles to see what leverage you have. But is the money involved worth it?<br/><br/>- People are increasingly going to court over disputes regarding video game mechanic patents. What will happen when there is no perceived difference between a video and board game? Even if you are too small to be worth suing for financial gains, larger companies may seek legal action or send you warnings as a matter of setting precedent for future cases.<br/><br/>But these are all issues you probably don't have to deal with. <br/><br/>I would argue most RPGs are hacks of RPGs that came before. RPG design culture seems to overall with hacking culture. <br/><br/>So is it cool to use mechanics from other games without permission? <br/><br/>I think it depends how unique the mechanic is. If it is such a commonly used mechanic that it isn't even clear whose permission you would even ask\u2026 then I would say not to worry about it. But if the mechanic is unique to a specific game or designer, to the extent people would respond, "that's like Circles from Burning Wheel" then I personally would recommend asking permission but at the least give credit. You could also take inspiration from the designers you are building from. Do they give credit in their books?<br/><br/>My IP lawyer friends would say don't give credit because it may be admitting fault in a future conflict. And they would say, if you want permission, make sure to get it in writing. But if it is a game mechanic that is commonly used, document it\u2019s common use and don't worry too much about it.<br/><br/>When you ask, "what's the difference between publishing a system hack and publishing a system hacked together from several other systems", can you give us examples of such systems?<br/><br/>Regarding Graham's Occupation and Insanity Die rules from Cthulhu Dark, my recommendation is to ask him for permission and give him credit. He's a very approachable person. His contact information is at the bottom of the 4th page in <a href="http://catchyourhare.com/files/Cthulhu%20Dark.pdf" rel="nofollow">this document</a>.<br/><br/>Is this for a game you are publishing? If it is for personal use, I wouldn't worry about the above. If it is for publishing, how close are you to publishing? If it is in the early stages, don't worry too much about this. By the time you are finished, your mechanics may look nothing like your initial inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327038/#Comment_327038" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T09:11:15+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  9:11AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game mechanics aren't protected by law, therefore in our society they cannot be stolen.

It makes me happy. But you don't need to.<br/><br/>If you're reproducing something I've written, I generally ask that you note my copyright in the text.<br/><br/>At this level of "stealing", it's nice to be credited. If you're stealing more broadly - say, there's an Occupation Die in your game - there's no need to credit at all. For example, the pools of 6s, in Cthulhu Dark, are influenced by Sorcerer.

It gets confusing and suggests something morally reprehensible might be happening.<br/><br/>Can we also never group copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets together?</blockquote>\nTo borrow a term from the music industry, perhaps "sampling" would be be better term.<br/><br/>There is definitely some confusion in this discussion as to what is "acceptable" and what isn't when it comes to sampling ideas from other games.<br/><br/>Copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets are all very specific terms. They protect different things in different ways. You don't want to mix them up.<br/><br/>Sampling a mechanic idea is perfectly acceptable and very common practice. The only time it comes into legal conflict is when the originator has managed to get a patent for it. This occurance is very rare simply because the trouble and cost usually isn't worth it for RPGs. In the case of WotC, they felt it was necessary to protect M:tG because of the number of copycat games that sprung up overnight.<br/><br/>Of course, much of this community would simply consider it rude to use a mechanic idea without crediting it. However, its very possible that the "originator" may have lifted the idea from someplace else.<br/><br/>A mechanic idea cannot be protected by copyright.
