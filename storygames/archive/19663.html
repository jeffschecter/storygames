If you're not comfortable sharing thoughts with that in mind, no harm no foul! Just want to be upfront and clear.<br/><br/>Anyway, a little playtesting has revealed that my "Resolve" system in Synthicide isn't working very well. I'm developing a new system, and part of that involves character motivations. I need a little help coming up with good motivations. Here's some background:<br/><br/><b>Rough game world description can be found here:</b> <a href="http://www.synthiciderpg.com/" rel="nofollow">www.synthiciderpg.com</a><br/><br/><b>Resolve System:</b> Resolve is meant to describe your character's mental health, connectedness to the universe, and will to live. Resolve points are spent to gain temporary benefits as well as allow your character to be resuscitated after dying. Resolve can also be gained or lost through positive/negative social behaviors.<br/><br/><b>Character Motivations:</b> One of the ways to gain Resolve is to successfully pursue your character's primary motivation. This Resolve point is gained independently from positive or negative social behaviors. In this way, a really antisocial character can hover around one 1-2 Resolve points if he survives a session and keeps pursuing what drives him. Here are the list of motivations I have so far:<br/><br/>\u2022\tProve your strength<br/>\u2022\tProtect your friends and family<br/>\u2022\tForgiveness is powerful<br/>\u2022\tDon\u2019t get mad, get even<br/>\u2022\tEliminate distraction<br/>\u2022\tSolve puzzles and mysteries<br/>\u2022\tLive life for now<br/>\u2022\tAvoid unnecessary risk<br/><br/>Any thoughts? These are pretty similar to alignments from DW, but I'm trying to keep them a little broad.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436747/#Comment_436747" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T18:30:30+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  6:30PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re "Live life for now" - I suppose you mean "Enjoy life" i.e. hedonism?  <br/>You mean more than mere survival, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Riovanes" title="Riovanes"><img alt="Riovanes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Riovanes">Riovanes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436749/#Comment_436749" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T18:34:01+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  6:34PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds similar to the Inspiration system in 5E D&amp;D. I liked that idea, but you only get 1 inspiration point there, and my thought was that 1 was too few. While you want these points to be awesome and special, it's good to try and avoid the "Too Awesome to Use" problem where players just hoard it, ex. grenades in some shooters, megalixers in Final Fantasy. In my experience 3 is the magic number to make people feel ok about actually using 1 of them. So maybe a maximum/starting count of 3 resolve points, 4 if some special condition is met, your "bard" class has a buff or whatever.<br/><br/>In general I like the idea of having a stock of points you can use to get a bonus or avoid death because you really, really want something.<br/><br/>In my game I've recently added a consequence for avoiding your motivation, which I think could work here as well. You get cool resolve points if you do it, sure, but what if you don't do it? Maybe they have to pass some kind of defensive roll.<br/><br/>As for your list of motives, it looks OK, but you're missing "get rich". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I also think "avoid unnecessary risk", while certainly a motive in real life, is a pretty boring motivation for a PC, not just for that player, but for the GM as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436752/#Comment_436752" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T21:08:43+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  9:08PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check 5E inspiration system and Spellbound kingdoms mood system, both are in different ways the next evolutionary step of 'mechanics that mechanically reward roleplaying and emotionally investing in the game/setting' Both these sources have changed my view on the subject, and while it's nothing exactly new, it's something that needs the particular balance attained in those two examples.<br/><br/>For 5E's Inspiration mechanic, it isn't something to be saved as a resource, hence you can't roleplay now, steal everyones spotlight until you fill your resources and then go play with your smartphone; you've to keep roleplaying here and there, even in the middle of combat to gain Inspiration again if you're in a difficult spot, and that's bound to make the scene more intense.<br/><br/>The mechanic in Spellbound Kingdoms is like yours, but it also has a sort of social HP that once depleted (by losing arguments, etc) leaves your motivations open to be attacked by your opponent. And losing your motivations in SK means death, otherwise your character can be put out of combat, but can't be killed. Also, motivations in SK are more or less left to the players, but the more you have and the more you interact and take care of them in the game, the more chances you have to get benefits from them.<br/><br/>A very important recomendation: add a procedure in character generation that connects PCs one with another and with some NPCs, either GM reated or introduced  by the players. This helps players not to make antisocial characters, which often makes the GM railroad the game from the very start to make all PCs meet each other. Nobody truly knows how to railroad these meetings into something memorable. If you make players distrust each other they'll be drawing their weapons on the next turn and joining them into a group will become harder to explain; force them together by the situation and they will forget their personal objectives until they need to roll motivation (and then, why should you use that mechanic at character creation?). The best you can get is when players collaborate to railroad themselves into forming a party, with the escuse of common interests (and then again, why do you give them the option to make interesting characters with different backgrounds and motivations, if at the end you will need to impose one single goal to all of them to make them form a group)<br/><br/>That's why I believe it's best to have the players create their own group dynamic from the start, by giving them bonds and common characters on their backgrounds. Also, you can leave them the part of coming up with a really good story of how they meet each other, without risking fumble rolls that could ruin the scene. That makes for a more solid and believeable group of characters.<br/><br/>I've found myself as a GM in the problem of wasting more spotlight time on the antisocial character of the party so he can find a believable reason to join the group, and this often got extended because one or more players have too many good reasons to dislike an antisocial character and failed sense motive rolls are only meant to make things worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai" title="Nikolai"><img alt="Nikolai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai">Nikolai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436753/#Comment_436753" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T21:12:55+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  9:12PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 9:13PM by Nikolai.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are 4 for you.\n<ul>\n<li>Defeat/impress your rival.<br/></li><li>Spread your wisdom/beliefs.<br/></li><li>Acquire power.<br/></li><li>Meet new friends.<br/></li></ul>\nRegarding "Eliminate distraction" and "avoid unnecessary risk", I haven't read anything about your setting, but I'm not sure how these would work into any sort of adventure/drama easily.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436754/#Comment_436754" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T22:44:42+00:00" title="August  8, 2014 10:44PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Check 5E inspiration system and Spellbound kingdoms mood system, both are in different ways the next evolutionary step of 'mechanics that mechanically reward roleplaying and emotionally investing in the game/setting' Both these sources have changed my view on the subject, and while it's nothing exactly new, it's something that needs the particular balance attained in those two examples.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>That's why I believe it's best to have the players create their own group dynamic from the start, by giving them bonds and common characters on their backgrounds.

Also, party associations are already prebuilt into character creation, as well as a few other origin tricks (why did you each become a sharper, how did you guys get your spaceship, etc.). I'm a firm believer in these things too. Based upon your description of the two systems above, it seems to me that the Resolve system is somewhere between the two. The exception is that Resolve is spent DURING the session to help you play, but earned/penalized at the END of the session based upon the dominant theme of play. And character motivations are intended to be only one dimension of the system \u2013 the positive interactions are the other dimension.\n<blockquote>Here are 4 for you.\n<ul>\n<li>Defeat/impress your rival.<br/></li><li>Spread your wisdom/beliefs.<br/></li><li>Acquire power.<br/></li><li>Meet new friends.<br/></li></ul>\n</blockquote>\nThese are some good ones! I particularly like "spread your wisdom/beliefs." I hear you guys \u2013 avoiding risk or eliminating distractions doesn't sound that exciting. I guess I was imagining characters who strive toward their main objective with machinelike persistence, or characters that carefully plan assaults or heists. So I should find a better way to express or dramatize those concepts.\n<blockquote>As for your list of motives, it looks OK, but you're missing "get rich". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.</blockquote>\nDefinitely need that. Resource pursuit/hoarding is a major theme in the game. Also, Riovanes, I hear what you're saying about "too good to use." Definitely something I'll have to feel out as we keep playing.\n<blockquote>Re "Live life for now" - I suppose you mean "Enjoy life" i.e. hedonism?  <br/>You mean more than mere survival, right?</blockquote>\nHedonism is a narrower, but more dramatic and direct term for what I'm trying to describe. Perhaps I should switch to that. It's definitely about trying to enjoy yourself and make life a better experience rather than worrying about tomorrow.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436779/#Comment_436779" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T14:16:35+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  2:16PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the (very rough) resolve system in its entirety:<br/><br/><b>SIMPLIFIED RESOLVE SYSTEM</b><br/>This system is the bread and butter of character motivation and mental health. It represents how connected to the universe your character feels as well as affects his chance of survival. Here\u2019s a quick summary:\n<blockquote>Resolve Points are spent to get an automatic 10 on the die, or to allow a dead character to be resuscitated. You acquire more Resolve Points by completing significant tasks or behaving positively toward others. You might lose Resolve Points by behaving negatively or antisocially. You can choose to gain Cynicism to avoid losing Resolve points, but Cynicism makes it harder for you to earn Resolve in the future.<br/></blockquote>\n<b>Starting Resolve &amp; Cynicism Scores</b><br/>Every character starts with a Resolve of 4 and a Cynicism of 0. From here on out, neither of those scores may ever exceed 10 nor be less than 0.<br/><br/><b>Spending Resolve</b><br/>You can spend one point of Resolve to gain abilities. Here are your options:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Get an automatic 10 instead of rolling the die.</b> You must choose to do this before making the roll.<br/></li><li><b>Come back from death.</b> Whenever a doctor attempts to resuscitate a dead character, the dead character must have an unspent Resolve point. This point is consumed upon resuscitation.<br/></li></ul>\n<b>Gaining &amp; Losing Resolve (end of session)</b><br/>At the end of a game session, go around the table to each player. You and the GM should discuss what the significant theme was for your character\u2019s behavior. Choose one of the following:<br/><br/><b>Altruistic sacrifice</b>\t+2 (must roll above your Cynicism score to gain)<br/><b>Altruistic assistance\t</b>+1 (must roll above your Cynicism score to gain)<br/><b>Harming innocents for profit</b>\t-1 (or +1 Cynicism)<br/><b>Wonton destruction</b>\t-3 (or +3 Cynicism)<br/><b>Altruistic sacrifice: </b>Whenever you give up significant wealth or expose yourself to danger for the sake of others, this is an altruistic sacrifice. Here are some examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Fighting a street gang to protect innocent locals<br/></li><li>Donating medicine to a sick colony<br/></li><li>Standing up to unjust authorities and suffering the consequences<br/></li></ul>\n<b>Altruistic assistance:</b> Helping others doesn\u2019t always require large sacrifice. Here are some examples of assistance:\n<ul>\n<li>Improving the lives of others through diplomacy<br/></li><li>Providing shelter and safety for someone in need<br/></li><li>??? (something about educating/helping others grow)<br/></li></ul>\n<b>Harming innocents for profit:</b> If you hurt an innocent person to improve your own situation, you either feel guilty or are incredibly cynical. Examples include:\n<ul>\n<li>Contract killing innocent targets<br/></li><li>Randomly robbing unlucky travelers<br/></li><li>Conning employers or patrons out of money<br/></li></ul>\n<b>Wonton destruction:</b> When you engage in sadistic behavior for its own reward, it  takes a deep toll on your psyche. You\u2019d have to be completely nihilistic to not lose resolve for this behavior. Examples are:\n<ul>\n<li>Murdering just for the thrill<br/></li><li>Torturing or mutilating someone<br/></li><li>Creating excessive and unnecessary innocent casualties to pursue a simple goal<br/></li></ul>\n<b>If you would gain Resolve\u2026</b><br/>Whenever you gain resolve at the end of the session,  you are subject to your Cynicism. Roll 1d10 and compare it to your Cynicism score. If you rolled equal to or below, your character is too emotionally guarded and feeling too negative to gain any Resolve from his positive behavior.<br/><br/><b>What about other bad things?</b><br/>Revenge, corruption or general violence are not judged by this system. These are facts of life in Synthicide, and even the most upstanding sharpers participate in these behaviors. It\u2019s only extreme actions with clearly unnecessary victims that are called into question.<br/><b>What if someone \u201cdeserved it?\u201d</b><br/>Often, players try to justify character behavior through \u201cthey had it coming,\u201d or \u201cfor all I know, they were going to betray me when they got the chance!\u201d Unless the players had strong evidence to support this perspective, this is just their Cynicism talking. As such, increase their Cynicism score instead of penalizing their Resolve.<br/><br/><b>Bonus Resolve</b><br/>There are two more ways to gain Resolve at the end of a session. None of this is subjected to a player\u2019s Cynicism score. See if the following two scenarios apply:<br/><br/><b>Did not die</b>\t+1 (not affected by cynicism)<br/><b>Successfully pursued your motivation</b>\t+1 (not affected by cynicism)<br/><br/><br/><b>Did not die:</b> Survival is a powerful motivator; if your character didn\u2019t die at any point during the session, gain one Resolve. Falling unconscious still counts! Your character must actually die in order fail this requirement.<br/><b>Successfully pursued your motivation:</b> Every player selects a motivation at character creation. If you and the GM agree that you successfully pursued your motivation, you gain one Resolve. This is the condensed list of motivations:\n<ul>\n<li>\tProve your strength<br/></li><li>Spread your wisdom/beliefs<br/></li><li>Protect your friends and family<br/></li><li>Forgiveness is powerful<br/></li><li>Don\u2019t get mad, get even<br/></li><li>Make new friends/allies<br/></li><li>Solve puzzles and mysteries<br/></li><li>\tLive life for now<br/></li><li>\tGet rich<br/></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436788/#Comment_436788" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T16:22:45+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  4:22PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2014 4:23PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

Would it be a good idea to have some motivations revolving around the treatment of people groups? Maybe a character motivation to persecute a certain group, or promote it.<br/><br/>Some examples of groups:<br/>\u2022 Organics (no cybernetic implants)<br/>\u2022 Enhanced (some upgrades)<br/>\u2022 Synthetics (robots)<br/>\u2022 Mutants (messed up DNA from the genetic war, may or may not have cybernetic implants)<br/>\u2022 various gangs (pirates, street gangs, etc)<br/>\u2022 The Church (the ultimate tech cult in control of everything)<br/><br/>Just wondering if it's going too far to put the hatred or love for a people group in the character motivations list. What do you guys think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436981/#Comment_436981" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T04:07:23+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  4:07AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It  could creat great story e.g your organic childs sickness needs sinth technology or your leader, respected person.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437100/#Comment_437100" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T15:28:57+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  3:28PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It  could creat great story e.g your organic childs sickness needs sinth technology or your leader, respected person.   </blockquote>\n Hey Paul, not quite sure what you mean here. Do you mean if you had a motivation to persecute/hate synthetics, but have an organic child that needs help from synthetics, that would be interesting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437104/#Comment_437104" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T15:59:13+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  3:59PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Would it be a good idea to have some motivations revolving around the treatment of people groups? </blockquote>\nNo, leave those kind of options open for players to introduce it, but never put it as an actual option in your corebook; it's kinda thin ice regarding racial/political/religious intolerance in general as a subject.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437141/#Comment_437141" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T22:17:04+00:00" title="August 12, 2014 10:17PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would addressing these issues at all be faux pas in your opinion?
