This will give us what I'm calling your Weekly Travel Index (WTI)!<br/><br/>I game with a single group (in the UK) of up to 6 people and only two of us live in the same town.  We usually try to play at one guy's house in the countryside, which gives us total travel times of about 40 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 30 minutes and 25 minutes.  We do this once every two weeks, with the very occasional weekend game.  <br/><br/>Our <b>WTI</b> is <b>12.08</b> minutes.  How happy are we?  We're ok with it since it's only every two weeks.<br/><br/>Or maybe this is just daft!?<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>Oh and perhaps this is also interesting:  What's the max travel time you and your group would accept to get your gaming fix? (Perhaps that's about what WTI you'd be happy with since most people are probably happy to travel for longer if they don't have to do it so often?)  Another way of of looking at it would be: what WTI do you think would cause your group to splinter?<br/><br/>The max WTI I'd personally put up with is about 20 mins - there's dedication to the gaming cause!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298404/#Comment_298404" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T00:02:20+00:00" title="October 27, 2010 12:02AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I dunno, this is weird and possibly interesting.

My journey home also takes about that time, unless I get a lift in which case it's half that. We play at Simon's house so his travel time is 0. Beth works with Simon so her travel time from the office is about 5 minutes, or 20 if we go to the supermarket on the way. Her return home takes about 40 minutes because she's not very familiar with the local area, or 10 minutes in car. The car is John's. It takes him about 20 minutes to get home but probably 30 if he drops Beth and me off somewhere. It takes Dave about 30 minutes to get here from his flat. Graham lives in a different town and it probably takes him around 90 minutes to get to the game. Those are the regulars. Adrian takes about 15 minutes by car or 45 minutes by tube but he only comes about 1 in 3 sessions. Ben plays about once a year and he lives in Paris. That takes about 4 hour by train and connections at both ends. Carol played last month. She lives in DC so it took her about 10 hours to get home from the game although she was staying in a hotel about 45 minutes away. Robin played last year and he was staying at Simon's so 0 but he does live in Toronto so about 10 hours away too. He might well play again this year making him a regular (although with a very low frequency).<br/><br/>I leave the WTI as an exercise for the reader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298415/#Comment_298415" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T06:33:41+00:00" title="October 27, 2010  6:33AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2010 6:34AM by Nathan_H.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It takes me roughly 20 minutes by foot.<br/>I think the longest it takes anyone to get there is something like half an hour driving.  <br/>In the past, I've driven half an hour to play in a regular (weekly, biweekly, monthly)game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298419/#Comment_298419" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T06:58:44+00:00" title="October 27, 2010  6:58AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my Friday group the trip is about 20 minutes in each direction, though we have one member who's commuting from Santa Cruz to San Jose, which means he's driving at least 40 minutes in each direction.<br/><br/>For my Saturday group the trip is about 10 minutes in each direction.<br/><br/>So my WTI would be 60 if both groups are playing consistently, though usually a bit less.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298421/#Comment_298421" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T07:06:10+00:00" title="October 27, 2010  7:06AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I plan on 30 minutes to get to Hans's place.

I also suspect the larger metro areas with more traffic actually result in comparable travel times (by car at least) to metro areas around the world (I had a Scottish co-worker who regularly talked about 2 hour one way commutes to/from London - I don't think New York or LA are any worse than that...).<br/><br/>Also, the day is 24 hours world round, thus affecting the maximum time spent on travel for a weekly (plus or minus) activity.<br/><br/>Now if we talk about travel times for special events that occur once a year or so, I wouldn't be surprised to see longer average travel times for the USA (especially if you eliminate the "locals"). I have flown across the country to attend conventions (though folks have also flown from Australia, Asia, and Europe to those conventions). I drove from Washington DC to Indianapolis one year to go from one convention to another. Big major conventions regularly attract a good attendance from across the country, and once they reach a certain size and appeal, draw from around the world. I expect that's the same in Europe, though the smaller size of Europe probably means a shorter average travel distance.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298515/#Comment_298515" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T15:22:49+00:00" title="October 27, 2010  3:22PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a while there if my local ~30 minute drive game didn't happen I would make a drive during rush hour over the 520 from Bellevue to Seattle to the open gaming night at the Wayward - it could take an hour and a half.
