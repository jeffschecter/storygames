I'd like to hear what folks here think.<br/><br/>So imagine lucky Brother Chance, a Dog with some theological issues.  He has come to believe (False Doctrine, of course) that it's OK to gamble when you feed a hungry Faithful with a profligate atheist's stake.  If any of the recipients of his Robin Hood gains question this, maybe their full stomachs quiet their consciences (False Worship).  In fact, when he gambles with this noble aim in mind, he's unusually lucky \u2014 if you asked him, he'd say <i>blessedly</i> lucky.<br/><br/>But we, the players, know differently.  Brother Chance is a Sith Dog; his success in gambling is Sorcery.<br/><br/>Now, mechanically - can he have the Demonic Influence dice?  Or does he only get dice from a Relationship with a demon?  Can he have both?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Longspeak" title="Longspeak"><img alt="Longspeak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Longspeak">Longspeak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191342/#Comment_191342" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-05T16:50:28+00:00" title="February  5, 2009  4:50PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have the book before me, but my interpretation is he gets dice for the highest level of demonic influence so far demonstrated.

Also, Brother Chance's player has no more right to getting the Demonic Influence dice than any other Dog in the game; he might position himself narratively so that he is more likely to get those dice, but that's a choice that he makes that any of the other players can also make.<br/><br/>Brother Chance can also take a relationship with Gambling or whatever, in which case he gets those dice whenever he wants to bring them in.<br/><br/>Also note (and I suspect this is what Jason is asking after), whether or not gambling is false doctrine is <em>entirely irrelevant</em> to what dice he rolls.

Great stuff!<br/><br/>Edit to add: the reason that the question of Chance's orthodoxy arose was the other Dogs in play. Also we decided that the story would improve if we mechanically coverted Chance to a sorcerer and declared him heterodox. He is likely to want to come back to the fold but events may tempt him back to the table one last time for the highest stakes yet - innocent lives. (All hanging fire from last time we played.) I don't think I've ever gotten sucked into a game this hard and I'm not even "really" playing - just getting my head around the system with a friend.

PC Sorcery works just like NPC Sorcery.<br/><br/>1) You need a relationship with the Demon.  No relationship, no Sorcery.  You get those relationship dice under two conditions.  The first is as per the normal rules if the relationship is helping you during a conflict or is the thing in jeopardy in the conflict.  The second way is if you let the demon possess you.  In that case you gain all the benefits of a possessed person per those rules.<br/><br/>2) Once you have the relationship you are now a Sorcerer and can use Demonic Influence just like any NPC Sorcerer by narrating in sorcerous effects.  Josh is wrong that the GM has veto power over this.  If you're a Sorcerer, you're a Sorcerer and get those dice like any NPC Sorcerer would.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191355/#Comment_191355" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-05T18:09:23+00:00" title="February  5, 2009  6:09PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jesse.

If a Dog breaches a tenet of the faith, they have the authority to do so with impunity.  If Chance says, "Gambling is okay is you give your winnings to charity," then it explicitly is okay.  There's no false doctrine, no sorcery.<br/><br/>This is part of what makes Dog's so cool.  The temptation of the absolute power.  So... how do you make it into a conflict?<br/><br/>What if the Town Steward thinks Chance is spouting madness and the two face down over it?<br/>What if the Dog comes back to Bridal Falls City and the... what are they called?  They take him to task over it.<br/><br/>Or what if... despite what Chance says aloud, he *knows* it's wrong.  This seems to be where you're headed.  This could be a conflict similar to the one you get when you're dying.  You play you, the GM plays Death.  <br/><br/>In this case, the GM plays the demons, trying to take hold of Chance's soul.  The stakes are "Does Chance Stave off Corruption?"  Or something like that.  Any demonic influence would go to the GM's dice pool.  If Chance loses, he doesn't get to be a Dog no more.

But the group is in a town where the power center is a Faithless, violent gunfighter and his posse (think Doc Holliday and his gang), and The Dentist is expecting Chance at his table in a last ditch at a diplomatic resolution before everything devolves into murder. There's a demon at the other end of some very important dice for Chance here \u2014 I think the expectation is that we'd structure gains from fallout as an <i>increased</i> Relationship with the demon if Chance goes to that table and a <i>decrease</i> if he doesn't.  I also think that stakes for the latter case need to include not just Chance's reconquest of his own soul, but also people dying, maybe lots of people, important Relationship people, a <i>Hamlet</i> body count.

Believe me, when John and I got to this point, we starting laughing - he was the GM of not one but two successful OWOD <i>Mage</i> games that I played in.  The circle was complete, and the learner was now the master.<br/><br/>We understood from the beginning that Chance is a sorcerer when he realizes he is.  We the players, from the outside, put him in that position by escalating relentlessly against what started as simple rationalization, and building him a Relationship with a demon when those escalations made us think of it.  We decided that the demon would aid Chance at the gaming table, and that would explain his extraordinary luck. All of this happened because it seemed like a really cool story to tell.  It immediately threw Chance into a battle for his soul; it got our unworldly Pollyanna-type to start acting like a leader of the Faithful; and it forced our caring hypocrite to make some choices about his hierarchy of virtue and vice.  Every character got a flag saluted.<br/><br/>The question was simply about how we might handle that next conflict.  If Chance can get 4 or 5d10 for his big showdown by being a sorcerer, that might push me toward sending him to The Dentist's table for "one last game" where he can be mighty with his wickedness.  (I think he's done as a Dog, as a PC.)  Otherwise, I think it's a cooler story to inaugurate a new era of tragedy, where he wins back his own soul but can't redeem the hotheaded Faithful who are going to get annihilated by The Dentist's posse, and who will die in their resentment, their souls gnawed away by it.<br/><br/>Edit to clarify - until now, the thought has been to give Chance the Demonic Influence dice when he wants them, after he's brought in his Relationship.  We're just trying to figure out to what extent that agrees with the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191391/#Comment_191391" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T08:59:47+00:00" title="February  6, 2009  8:59AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, one more question.  Suppose Chance and The Dentist sit down for a very high-stakes game of poker.  Chance is going to go all-out sorcerer, so we've concluded he gets the Influence dice.  How about The Dentist?<br/><br/>On one hand, I think that usually the forces that oppose the Dogs should get those dice.  The Dentist is, no mistake, opposing the Dogs, and is the occasion for their being in town.  If demons just want to sow fallout, reaping a harvest of destruction on all sides, they will want to dice up The Dentist.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this case is a little unusual in that we have a Dog who currently sets the sin high-water mark in town (though that will change if he doesn't act).  Chance is a sorcerer and there is a demon who is his special buddy.  If the sum of the demonic influence in town pulls in Chance's direction, then The Dentist will have to rely on his native luck, his intimidating reputation, his bloody-handed posse, and maybe his large gun - the demons have a favorite.<br/><br/>So - Influence dice for The Dentist or no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191424/#Comment_191424" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T12:03:56+00:00" title="February  6, 2009 12:03PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2009 12:14PM by Jesse.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're misunderstanding the Demonic Influence dice.<br/><br/>The Demonic Influence dice only come into play under two circumstances.<br/><br/>1) A sorcerer using sorcery.<br/>2) Situations where there is no discernible character opposing the player.  For example, in one game an unmarried girl was giving birth out in the desert.  A player wanted to race to get the father to her in time to marry them so the baby wouldn't be born out of wedlock.  So I rolled Demonic Influence to "play" the distance and time with raises like, "Your horse gives out half way", "The trail ends and you're suddenly lost",  "a bit of rock face collapses and pins you"  That kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Note: That the healing rules are simply an application of this principle.<br/><br/>So in this case The Dentist is a character, and he's not a sorcerer using sorcery, so no Demonic Influence.  Even possessed people don't get Demonic Influence just demon relationship dice within the scope of their possessed powers.<br/><br/>Also considering what Josh said, I'm not sure at what point you would ever play Demonic Influence on the player's side.<br/><br/>I'm clearly not Vincent so maybe there's something I've missed but this has always been my understanding of how Demonic Influence, Sorcerers and Possessed people work.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>Edited Note: There is ONE case I can think of where you *might* roll Demonic Influence in on the side of a non-Sorcerous character and that's if there's a environmental factor SO compelling it can't be ignored *and* it's narrated to be taking what can be perceived as a proactive action.  For example imagine a Dog is in a fist fight with someone in a burning building.  The burning building has become a REALLY BIG DEAL beyond just being a cool back drop and you narrate, "And that's when the floor gives out..."  Then you could roll demonic influence in.<br/><br/>I still can't think of a reason you would ever roll it in favor of a player though.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191432/#Comment_191432" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T12:29:09+00:00" title="February  6, 2009 12:29PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, thanks.  Again, I appreciate your clarity.  So in this case, Chance gets the Influence dice because he is calling on a demon for help, as a sorcerer.  But you see The Dentist getting just his own dice, since he isn't a sorcerer specifically acting with his sorcerous power \u2014 unless we decide he is.  Come to think of it, that would be one hell of a twist, wouldn't it?  If somewhere in his past, he was just like Chance, and he went back to the table that one last time and surrendered to the same corruption?  I thought I was out of room to escalate Chance's dilemma, but clearly not.<br/><br/>The reason I was thinking that The Dentist gets the dice is the line in the Conflict and Resolution summary where Baker says that one role of the DI dice is "to bring to bear the sort of generalized badness of what\u2019s going on in the town."  Your argument as I see it is that we have a specific badness in play, personified by The Dentist, so that's what the conflict is against, not the more nebulous threat represented by the DI.  Am I right?<br/><br/>In any case, now I see how you bring in the Influence dice when you're doing healing and similar situations where the conflict is against something abstract.  Your example of the race against the clock is a good one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191436/#Comment_191436" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T12:32:54+00:00" title="February  6, 2009 12:32PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's more or less it.<br/><br/>If you really, really want DI on the side of The Dentist but don't want him to be a sorcerer then here's a nasty trick: Narrate the deck of cards like it was actively working against the player.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191455/#Comment_191455" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T14:23:29+00:00" title="February  6, 2009  2:23PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a nasty trick, and one I will keep up my sleeve for a later conflict.
