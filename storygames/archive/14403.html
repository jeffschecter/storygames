That just seems like the kind of idea that people on this forum would love (I've included it below).<br/><br/>Treasures come in 4 levels. The greater the level of the treasure, the more XP it\u2019s worth to steal. As a rule of thumb, the treasure level shouldn\u2019t exceed the highest level member of the party.<br/><br/>Level 1 \u2013 Unnamed and unknown.<br/>This is either a lost and forgotten treasure or just a stack of money. Like the plate of rubies offered to Conan in the one movie.<br/><br/>Level 2 \u2013 \u201cThe [Object]\u201d<br/>This level of treasure is known, but not particularly well. Sure, it\u2019s more valuable than a plate full of rubies, but it\u2019s not the best<br/>you can get. <br/><br/>Level 3- \u201cThe [Object] of [Someone]\u201d<br/>Now we\u2019re talkin\u2019 treasure. It\u2019s a famous object belonging to a famous person. But it\u2019s still not the best you can get.<br/><br/>Level 4 \u2013 \u201cThe [Adjective] [Object] of [Someone]\u201d<br/>Sweet. This is the good stuff. This category encompasses the most famous and valuable of all treasures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327471/#Comment_327471" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T05:15:40+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  5:15AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chris, you're welcome !<br/><br/>I always forget that this part about treasures didn't make it in the second version of the game because, I've always used something similar : a treasure XP worth did not depend on it's absolute value but on the number of people who wanted to do something with it (keep it, steal it, destroy it, hide it...). This way, I had no shortage of motivated NPC to throw into the characters path !<br/><br/>For me, beside all the fun bits that everybody love about the RBH (awesome points, cool powers, arenas, etc...) what realy shone in the RBH rules was the very sound advices about adventure preping : always at least one treasure and one monster (with a precise definition of what are a treasure or a monster) and every NPC linked to one or the other. Et voil\xe0 : ADVENTURE ! For me, the rule about the treasure name and xp value was always linked to that.<br/><br/>I must add that the part about the treasure and rival NPCs in the RBH has always reminded me of the Raiders of the lost Ark movie. Just cast your PCs as Indy and Bellocq as the NPC who want to keep the treasure for himself, the Gestapo officer as the one who wants to use it for the Reich, etc... <br/><br/>Thanks to everyone who asked for this file.

I don't remember if it came from a discussion with Eric or if it was common sense.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think it's cool like that but it's one of the areas of the game that is open to re-hack :<br/>- what if you can't keep your awesome tokens after a fight but you can convert them into a bonus to a danger test for an objective that you must declare (= instant flag) ?<br/>- what if you create a new fighter talent which allows him to keep the tokens after le fight ?<br/>etc...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327776/#Comment_327776" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-04T15:27:48+00:00" title="June  4, 2011  3:27PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am getting ready to play RBH. I first read it a couple of years ago but only now I will be able to play it. It is a beautiful game. It has the elements of a simple hacknslash with simple rules but strategic and meaningful options during combat. The story games elements are very well designed especially the dangers essentially acting as clear stakes during conflicts. The awesome tokens seem story gamish but I think they lie between SGs and traditional RPGs since there are things like action points in them that seem similar.<br/><br/>The system is very solid and consistent all around and I haven't felt the desire to hack it. Except maybe, to make the anthropomorphic races just human. The deep simplicity just seems great.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the author was concerned but was never able to make a definitive statement of how he hoped games would be run but I really think it is ultimately unnecessary. I would have left exactly how it was written in the file. Get a monster, plus or minus a treasure and make a handful of NPCs who are related to either the monster, the treasure or both. If you want to make a map of the land or a relationship map or just railroad the PCs, it is up to you and the group and the system will support any of these and more.<br/><br/>It is sad that RBH was never published.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327784/#Comment_327784" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-04T17:56:41+00:00" title="June  4, 2011  5:56PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I played, Awesome Tokens only existed for the purposes of combat.
