Redbrick has a licence to produce stuff for it (and so, last I heard, does Living Room Games, which led to the confusing situation of having two separate current editions of ED).<br/><br/>Fading Suns, of course, is a somewhat successful and very well thought of sci-fi game created by Holistic Design, which has not been able to maintain much of a release schedule for it the last few years, so now Redbrick has got a licence to do that too.<br/><br/>It doesn't have a huge profile in onlineRPGtalkdom - my impression is that it just gets on and does what it does, and fans of those games are glad of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133488/#Comment_133488" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T14:04:00+00:00" title="March  8, 2008  2:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IIRC, Earthdawn was tacked on the setting as the "fantasy past" of Shadowrun. I don't know if the connection is still in place.<br/><br/>Fading Suns was born with a custom system (the Victory Points system) which was kinda bland and had several problems (with combat and armor, I think). Later it was converted to the d20 system like many other games. And like many games, in the d20 version it kinda sucked (CoC d20, anyone?), so it came back to the VP system (I think). The setting is widely considered ad "one of the few kitchen sink settings done well": it's a mishmash of fantasy, sf, wh40k, dune and several other sources... but yeah, done well.<br/><br/>Redbrick has picked up the license and is publishing a couple of supplements for the old Fading Suns implementation, and will produce a new edition with a different system (I think).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133491/#Comment_133491" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T14:16:13+00:00" title="March  8, 2008  2:16PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm from New Zealand, and I've never heard of these guys.

They're ambitious, work hard, and from what I've seen seem to have an actual business plan and to be interested in putting out quality product. They mostly publish PoD, through Lulu and maybe another distributor (I think I remember there being issues between the company they used in New Zealand and the Lulu printers in the states and Europe, but I was in India at the time and missed a lot of details.) I think they follow a traditional model, but with more emphasis on direct to consumer sales than three tier, and what seemed to me to be a pretty decent assement of the demands of the current market. (Which is to say they don't do huge print runs and hope to sell enough of them to make ends meet, they actually manage their supply and demand flow.) <br/><br/>In general, for your friend, I'd say to always be careful and get good contracts and demand they be followed. However, I'd also say the Red Brick guys are well worth talking to, and seem pretty much on the level. James Flowers is a particularly approachable guy, and I still get emails from him sometimes, years after we worked together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/morgue" title="morgue"><img alt="morgue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/morgue">morgue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133506/#Comment_133506" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T16:29:52+00:00" title="March  8, 2008  4:29PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2008 4:31PM by morgue.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only had passing encounters with James, but he's always been bloody marvellous from my end.

Fans seemed to feel the support was good and the team friendly.  They are now working on a 3rd edition of <i>Fading Suns</i>' Victory Point system and seem quite responsive to and inclusive of fandom.  <br/><br/>Incidentally, <i>Fading Suns</i> was first released in 1996 and is more <i>Dune</i>- than WH40K-inspired; it has a very nice, rich setting even though the VP system was never quite perfected.  I've run and played it in house-ruled versions, in <i>Masterbook/Torg</i>, in <i>7th Sea</i>, and now in <i>D6 Space</i>.  I'm curious to see the next incarnation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133545/#Comment_133545" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T03:29:59+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  3:29AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, people always make the 40k-FS connection basically for two reasons, IMO: first, there are warrior monks with (kinda) power armor, and second, it was the only SF game with a "medieval in space" vibe, and as such the only one even remotely related to 40k. And before Dark Heresy a lot of people were really desperate for a "true" 40k game.

I am the Managing Director of RedBrick and happy to answer anything you want to know about us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a lead-in, we currently license Earthdawn from FASA (Living Room Games' license lapsed some time ago, btw; there just hasn't been a formal announcement from them about it), and Fading Suns from Holistic Design Inc. Earthdawn uses its own Step System, designed by Greg Gordon of Torg and other fame. Fading Suns uses the Victory Point System, although there is a d20 rulebook and some dual-statted supplements available.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep a low profile as we are a small company, with a hard-working team. Because of the geographical nature of our business (we have developers in Germany, USA, UK, and New Zealand), we utilize the Internet for pretty much everything we do. Our web sites at http://www.earthdawn.com and http://www.fading-suns.com both run a full content management system, and we use project management methodologies to develop products. Many of us have full-time jobs and families; RedBrick fills in the cracks. *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nWe partner with OneBookShelf for eBooks and Lulu for print books, the latter being a print-on-demand partner. We sell direct to customers through these sites. You won't find our books in retail stores or via distribution, and that is not likely to change any time soon. If you want to read a little more about the business and how we are going, I write up a State of the 'Brick report each year. You can read these at http://www.earthdawn.com/index.php?categoryid=22<br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven't had any formal offers from anyone regarding publishing new games, although we have had several casual enquiries. The original poster may be referring to our forthcoming Pro-Indie label, which is mentioned in the 2007 State of the 'Brick article. We haven't formally announced Pro-Indie yet as we are still "ironing out the kinks" on the web site, but it's not far away. Western City will be our first Pro-Indie release and we hope to publish more independent games in due course.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully that is enough to start with and I've not bored anyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to answering your questions as they come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nJAMES FLOWERS<br/>\nDirector, RedBrick Limited<br/>\nhttp://www.redbrick.co.nz<br/>\nhttp://www.earthdawn.com<br/>\nhttp://www.fading-suns.com                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133638/#Comment_133638" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T21:14:18+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  9:14PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, just saw this thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Earthdawn is a big hardback book, and I think it's d20 derived.</blockquote>\nLOL, no. It came out in the early 90s. Fantasy Shadowrun (same world, different epoch) with a totally different die scheme (you roll pretty much every polyhedral, stats and skills rated like "1d6+1d8"; "1d10+1d4", etc). From what I hear, when FASA went dead, these guys stepped in, picked up the rights, and republished it (or was it Living Room Games? I forget: Maybe LRG had it, now RedBrick has it). In any case, it's on my buy list for this spring: Still haven't sprung for it (got too much going on now), but in a few months the PHB and GM Guide will be mine all mine.\n<blockquote>Fading Suns is a 40k wannabe, and I've heard of it but never seen it.</blockquote>\nLOL, no. If anything (skims above) it really came off as a Dune Wannabe: Strong religious orders, perfect Atreides/Harkonnen/Corrino analogues, Spacing Guild, etc. Lukewarm to its generic system (though it had cool moments; like IIRC, if you fumbled a "sin" roll bad enough, the entire atmosphere of the planet you are on would boil away instantly, killing every living thing on the planet), and it had positively lame aliens ("Oh, hey, Elves! And other races that look exactly like Humans but with funny foreheads, or extra arms!" sorry I'm a bit snobby when it comes to SF aliens). <br/><br/>But man, the classes were focused and tight. When you made a character, there really was no question of "Hmm, what should I do? How should I act?" because it was pretty much built into the premise of the classes. I played a meandering campaign once, but right now it's on my "Must Buy" list, because next year my project will be "Story-fy Fading Suns like I'm doing now with L5R". It's got a lot of explosive potential (religious conflict! House/family conflict! Guild conflict! Oh my!), it just feels that it was never "packed into the cannon" quite right.<br/><br/>In any case, I know very little of the overall operation over what's been said about, but I give them a fat thumbs up for keeping a few underdogs in print in a viable, healthy manner. At least, that's what I'm feeling.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133642/#Comment_133642" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T21:54:29+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  9:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2008 9:55PM by oliof.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Annunaki,<br/>\nI know the author of Western City personally, so I am in the know.

FASA Corporation closed their (publishing) doors in 1999. WizKids picked up the properties and licensed Earthdawn to Living Room Games, who published a couple of First Edition books (an adventure and Barsaive at War), before releasing Earthdawn Second Edition and a number of other supplements. We started negotiations with WizKids in 2002, but the rights reverted to FASA and it wasn't until late 2003 that RedBrick picked up a second license. Our plans for the game line are somewhat more ambitious... *grin* The Earthdawn world is the Fourth World in FASA's cosmology, an age of magic earlier than Shadowrun's Sixth World (we are currently in the no/very low magic Fifth World). Equinox, our forthcoming in-house sci-fi game, is set in the Eighth World.<br/>\n<br/>\nFading Suns is very much a Swiss army knife science fiction roleplaying game. Dune is just one of the many influences. The VPS mechanics are probably most similar to those used by King Arthur Pendragon or HeroQuest. Because of the hiatus of the game line (about three years), it has taken some energy to bring the game back into play -- more so than Earthdawn -- but the two eBook adventure Shards, and the new Church Fiefs and Arcane Tech supplements have been well received. We released the Revised Second Edition Rulebook because the main rulebook was out of print. Work is underway on Fading Suns Third Edition, which will utilize the VPS system, but a revised (and hopefully better) incarnation. In the meantime, we are still working on new Shards and at least one more supplement for the Second Edition Fading Suns line.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of the company itself, yes RedBrick stays low on the radar. As someone noted earlier, we prefer to just get on with the job. *smile* Our business model is based around managing the Intellectual Property interests of our licensors, and publishing the highest quality products we can produce using the newer on demand technologies available. We are a conservative company, and the model is intended to be one of steady, sustainable growth over the long-term. We assemble dedicated teams for each product line, and we work with team members who have proven to be "personalities" that we can work with. This is an important point -- everyone has an equal say in what happens to make a product work; we don't have the time or energy to waste on dealing with egos. Development is fluid and fun, and everyone gets involved as much as they want (most important for those of us with busy paying jobs and demanding families). However, we do work to a publication schedule. This is necessary to get books finished and into print. We have flaws, like other publishers. Sometimes we just get things wrong. However, we recognize these traits, accept them as important learnings, note them so we can try to avoid making the same mistakes again, and make corrections where appropriate (one of the advantages of on demand). We place great value on "constructive" feedback from fans. "Evolution, not revolution!" And we're happy to talk about what we do and how we do it -- if people ask. Otherwise, it's back to the wordprocessor and layout applications.. *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and greetings Oliof! (Gee, there's a veritable "Who's Who" on this site!) Yes, I'll see if I can get Dammi to point J\xf6rg here. Western City is not far away from publication (and, bias aside, it rocks). J\xf6rg has done a great job on the game; the fact he's such a nice guy is extra gravy on the hash... *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards, James                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133652/#Comment_133652" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T02:04:12+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  2:04AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Earthdawn had completely fallen off my radar, but based on James's friendly and informative posts here, I'm off to reacquaint myself with it.<br/><br/>So... well done, James!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anunnaki" title="Anunnaki"><img alt="Anunnaki" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anunnaki">Anunnaki</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133655/#Comment_133655" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T02:58:41+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  2:58AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The pleasure is mine, John.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that reacquaintance is a memorable and pleasant experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards, James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133672/#Comment_133672" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T06:29:16+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  6:29AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the <i>Earthdawn</i> setting, but after struggling for a couple of years with the system our group finally gave up.

One of the major contributors to complexity during play is players having to add/subtract step numbers then reference a table to see what dice to roll. We applied a number of tweaks to the rules in the Player's Compendium to minimize this. That involved adding to/subtracting from the results of rolls and, in many cases, modifying the target Difficulty Number. The net upshot is characters roll the dice that are listed on their sheet -- not as many table lookups, and faster game play. Of course, the original rules are still there -- just as an optional rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards, James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133807/#Comment_133807" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T14:13:21+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  2:13PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, the table lookups were not a problem for our group; it was the fact that while the mean result goes by one point with each step, the variance fluctuates wildly.  As a result, your overall chances of hitting a given target number can actually drop with an increase in step.<br/><br/>Well, that and the fact that these old modules are written with the idea that you roll for everything, including tying your shoes.  Roll often enough, and you'll end up failing spectacularly on something really dumb...

Why not just give all Questors a free +2 steps in everything across the board, and maybe +3 steps in health/damage related abilities? That would take the game and make it look something like the midpoint of traditional Earthdawn and Exalted (perhaps at that "Dragon Blooded" level), but that's a place I love my fantasy gaming to be, honestly.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133957/#Comment_133957" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T08:25:03+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  8:25AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Hey James, now that you've poked your head in, I was really curious about something (sorry to divert from the topic).<br><br/>4e is coming out this year.
