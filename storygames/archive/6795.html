However, under the older D20 trademark license, they would have 30 days to cure a breach.  If there is still a breach after that time, then they have to destroy all copies of violating books.  However, they could at least sell off a bunch of their stock during that time.  <br/><br/>Under the new GSL, they must immediately destroy all copies of books if Wizards decides to remove or further restrict the license, which they can do at any time and for any reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lemon" title="lemon"><img alt="lemon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lemon">lemon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151287/#Comment_151287" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T02:06:04+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  2:06AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really hope we're going to see third parties skip the GSL altogether and use the rights they already have under existing copyright and trademark law.<br/><br/>It's too bad litigation (be it meritorious, vexatious or frivolous) is such a death sentence in the US.

I'm tempted to go through the agreement line by line but I probably won't! It's also worth looking at the SRD as it clarifies additional restrictions not apparent in the license itself. Including the inability to use certain monsters that Wizards blatantly took the names from other works!<br/><br/>But really quick, putting out modules where you can't include monster stats, page reference, in some instances where you have to use an alternate name for certain monsters (confusing the ability to reference even more), you can't use classics such as Beholders, Demons, Devils, Displacer Beasts, Drow, Githyanki, Githzerai, Mind Flayers, you can't offer online support, website errata, wikis, blogs, forums, free downloads, supplementary materials, fan contests, miniatures, and if Wizards decides to change or further restrict the GSL in any way, for any reason, they can force you to immediately pull all materials using the previous license... and they don't have to notify you :-) And these are all negatives without going into discussion of open gaming or how you can't produce backwards compatible work or you can't provide modules supporting multiple systems, and once you go GSL on a product line you can't even go back to OGL, even if the GSL changes into something completely different that would invalidate your product line. These are all negatives from my perspective if I simply want to do what the license is expressly designed to do.

It seems pretty clear that third party modules and setting sourcebooks are what they're encouraging, and "This is a new game but we want to sell it using the D&amp;D branding" is pretty strongly discouraged. From a design perspective, anyway, a lot of the people who are complaining are doing so about things like "What do you mean I can't totally rewrite how attributes/healing/falling damage works?" <br/><br/>Personally I can see how "You can add almost anything, but you can't change the rules" fits into their brand strategy.<br/><br/>(Disclaimer: IANAL, and I'm not looking to be proven right or wrong, that's just my own take on the matter. I recognize the IP issues people may have with how the license is written are separate from what I'm talking about.

I don't think this would be common place or possibly ever happen, but that is how the license reads. It's essentially written so that Wizards has 0 responsibilities and can terminate any material they don't want at any time for any reason with no notification or warning. In most licensing agreements that I've seen, even between big and small companies... and I mean big, I deal with Disney, Sony, Nasa, The Yankees, the small companies at least are able to include something where they have to be notified and are free and clear for a specific length of time after the product is released with a few clearly defined exceptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151332/#Comment_151332" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T07:25:34+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  7:25AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey smart guys, business moguls, lawyers, et al,<br/><br/>I'd love to see this parsed line by line with an eye toward third party publishing.
