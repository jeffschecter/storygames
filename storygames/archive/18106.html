I thought: "now THAT'S what a dungeon should look like!" It was very dark. The torches illuminated the faces of the characters but little else. It certainly wasn't possible to see the entire room. <br/><br/>I was thinking that a game in a dark hostile place that focuses on the resource of light more than anything else could be fun and exciting. <br/><br/>Maybe all fights and traps and negotiations and seductions and other adventure stuff would be "successful," but depending on a die roll, they would eat up units of time. Once the time hits zero, the torch burns out and the characters are at the mercy of the lurking creatures who can hunt in the dark. <br/><br/>Any other ideas for a game about darkness?

That is, the issue has not been that lights would have been running out (the players are pretty conservative about their supplies here), but rather that the underground is simply a fucked up environment for doing almost anything at all if the game doesn't allow for conventions to override challenges. For examples, consider the following difficulties:<br/>- Holding light sources requires hands. A hand holding light is not holding e.g. a weapon.<br/>- A wildly swinging light source causes wildly swinging shadows. Anybody moving with a light source swings it slightly, anybody moving in haste swings it wildly.<br/>- Party members cast shadows as well. An ill-positioned ally may cut all direct light from reaching a target, leaving only second-hand scatter for perceiving things that are in their shadow.<br/>- Distance, color, size and direction of movement are difficult to gauge for things that are in shadow. Basically 80% of your field of vision is going to be in shadow either due to indirect light or weakness of light in a dungeon environment; you want to be looking at the things at the limit of your light, not at your toes. The only bright light is the one that is right next to your face in that torch or lantern, always ready to ruin your night vision.<br/>- The brighter a torch burns, the faster it will generally go out. The tactical time element in exploration is usually measured in exploration rounds of ten minutes each. Generally it's a given that most of your exploration will occur in the relatively dim light of conservative light sources, as you'll spare your more powerful ones for where you need strong light.<br/>- Lighting a new light source from scratch takes an entire exploration round, basically, unless you've got some non-standard preparations for it.<br/><br/>The above sorts of complications can get really dangerous if and when the GM decides to introduce these types of questions into the game. My usual philosophy is that while the game might have conventions that generally disregard certain types of difficulties, they're just conventions and abstractions - any player is within their rights to query into the details behind the abstract rules. Sometimes this can get really dangerous when the GM calls for a spot check on light sources in the middle of an underground skirmish. Who's got the lantern? You dropped your torch before entering melee, right? You're actually facing a dark room, trying to fight a nocturnal predator while your own silhouette blocks light from entering the room?<br/><br/>(The above is particularly comical when the players manage to have every character in the party drop their light sources when combat is entered. That's a mistake they're not likely to make twice, provided the GM notices.)<br/><br/>My impression is that I play with these types of issues somewhat more than many GMs, who apparently rely more on the conventions of dungeon-crawling as explained in many D&amp;D rules manuals. I like to have the players do the groundwork themselves, figuring out how they're going to position their light and bodies in the dungeon to make exploration safe and efficient. This is, in fact, a general method that I use in seeking challenges: list out things that are difficult or could go wrong, and then bring them up one by one for the players to solve. When I bring up something they don't have an answer for, that's where we have a crisis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408828/#Comment_408828" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T09:40:20+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  9:40AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make a bunch of paper circles.

The idea of changing conventions to emphasize different parts of the fiction is really interesting to me. It seems that most GMs and most systems operate with the convention that the characters are competent survivalists and dungeoneers, so issues related to light sources are hand waved while issues related to combat and magic are carefully measured. I wonder if it would be fun to assume that the characters are going to win every fight, cast every spell,  and overcome every obstacle, but we are careful and specific about the ever dwindling light. I don't know if Torches&amp;Dragons would be fun or not. (Or its companion game Rations&amp;Dragons.) But, I really liked your list of issues -- laterns swinging wildly and inconvenient shadows sure sounds fun.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh" title="Chugosh"><img alt="Chugosh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/289/nOED25F16XENN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh">Chugosh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408833/#Comment_408833" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T11:20:18+00:00" title="March 12, 2013 11:20AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiuHr5YVJBI" rel="nofollow">This</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQZqbGME5HY" rel="nofollow">This</a> are great demonstrations of what torches actually do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408834/#Comment_408834" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T11:30:03+00:00" title="March 12, 2013 11:30AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

Playing a Dread (jenga) dungeon crawl with a flickering candle on the table (and having to continue in total darkness if the light goes out) sounds like a pretty intense experience. It nicely relates the frightening feeling of not having the light you need to your character's reduced odds of survival. Fumbling for that tower in total darkness sounds terrifying.<br/><br/>But you could also do it mechanically, as Marshall suggested. If your light is out, you have to roll two dice instead of three from now on, and you lost access to your special moves (or whatever). <br/><br/>I'm imagining a typical adventuring "party" with a wise and powerful wizard (a la Gandalf). The wizard's magic is powerful and can overcome all kinds of major problems, so long as the others keep him safe. The only problem is that the wizard needs light in order to be able to read his spellbook -- once the light goes out, you're in the dark, and it's up to the others to put their tools (steel, wits, and fortitude) to use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
