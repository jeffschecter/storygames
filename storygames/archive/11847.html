For instance, "makes you talk like your character" and "involves dressing up" are part of the definition of larp, because the games people call larps commonly involve these traits.<br>- There are lots of grey zones and overlap. Is jeepform larp? Is freeform tabletop? Is interactive performance theatre larp? Is the HeroQuest boardgame a role-playing game?<br>- Some of these categories have very little in common, although they're all part of what we call "games". Arthaus larp has very little in common with board games.

Magic: The Gathering encodes all but the basic rules of play on the cards, which are collectible and can be combined to create different play experiences. That's useful stuff for an RPG, but rarely used. Same for any game that has a board, and contains all the rules on the board. Another slick implementation that has potential for an RPG.<br><br>I think it's fun to look at clever applications in different "genres" of games and see how we can apply those to our own designs.<br><br>Although I don't expect the next edition of Monopoly to include some kind of fictional cause-and-effect, like Community Chest cards which read, "Has your character attended a charity fundraiser up until now? If so, collect $200 and draw another card."

That, to me, is the defining root of RPGs, and puts them clearly in their own category. If anything, I'd think that the marketing strategies between the three would be more similar than the design goals.<br><br>However I do agree that I think certain aspects - particularly the use of gadgets and utilities such as markers, cards and special boards - are not presently being used to their full potential in the hobby. The recent revision of Warhammer attempted to do this, but to my mind went in the wrong direction. Instead of using utilities to simplify the process of role-playing, they merely felt like gimmicks to me. The many different symbols on the dice for instance could have been so much more intuitive and concise in their usage, and didn't bring nearly as much to the game as I had hoped they would.<br><br>So personally, the crossover between the triad of tabletop games has at least made me think of new ways to structure the rules beyond funny shaped dice and endless look-up tables - not that I used much of either in the past, but it's certainly given me new ideas. I do however think that these would be better implemented with direct reference to the central concepts of storymaking, rather than being simply used to turn an RPG into something more akin to a board game.<br><br>-Ash                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264492/#Comment_264492" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T08:47:40+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  8:47AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what makes an RPG is shared fiction and character portrayal informed by and affecting game mechanics.

By looking at other parts of reality that compress to whatever you just compressed your game to, you might find surprising parallels. My answer to Tyler's question is that it allows bringing <i>solutions</i> to problems in from a much broader pool. For example, I sometimes play a D&amp;D variant with a GM that rotates by vote every scene (and even every combat round, during combat). The biggest large scale problem that's come up is plot continuity. Threads get introduced and then accidentally abandoned all over the place, or threads we want to wrap up we instead stay with 'cause someone else just came up with a great scene and got voted for. My roommate looked at the problem not as "How do I fix the scene economy in this RPG?" (one answer: the Sons of Liberty model worked all right), but as "How do I fix this supply/demand/throughput problem?" and has started looking at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" rel="nofollow">Kanban</a>-like solution.<br/><br/>Regarding the Disguised Queries link: maybe it turns out you already have a neat machine that cheaply sorts kittens by fuzziness, and you can use it to sort bleggs and rubes pretty well.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264533/#Comment_264533" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T13:02:52+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  1:02PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what is useful in terms of design is not the name of the game type but the physical properties of that type.<br/><br/>An RPG usually comes as a book - that allows people to create their own world.<br/>A board game comes with a board and counters. The location of things is usually meaningful. <br/>Card games come with cards. The rules of play can emerge based on the cards drawn.<br/>In a LARP people dress up and talk in their characters voice but can only do what we can actually do. <br/><br/>I see these as different poetic forms. One may be a limerick, another a sonnet, a third a haiku. All are poetry but different. <br/><br/>I now make board games to do story games because I have the machines to do so. Many people make RPGs because they can go to a POD printer to make them. Card are the hardest because they are art intensive and difficult to manufature in small numbers. <br/><br/>As to how they play I think that you are right, the actual rules can produce very similar ends. They can all make story games but they don't have to. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264545/#Comment_264545" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T14:04:10+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  2:04PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thinking is that in an RPG:  <br/><br/>* The rules provide support for each player or "playing piece" representing an individual person (a character)<br/>* The rules provide support for the characters in the game to interact in ways that can't be represented solely by arrangements of physical objects (including notional ones such as points)<br/><br/>If it has these elements it's an RPG.

Within board games, card games and RPGs there are different reasons for playing different sub-groups, but within those sub-groups there is appeal.<br/><br/>Someone who likes Magic: The Gathering probably has a tendency to like games like Warhammer and D&amp;D - they both involve collecting and a large amount of combinations. Another person might like chess, poker and one of the "This book is all you need" RPGs. They want endless replay value without having to expand on what they've bought. This could be dictated by financial constraints, but both cases you have something different. Someone who likes Risk might equally like Snakes &amp; Ladders, Paranoia and War - relatively mindless fun where you can leave it mostly to the dice and worry less about your own decisions. These games wouldn't appeal at all to people who want tight control over their game-play and like to emphasise strategy. What sets RPGs out from the rest is you can have all these aspects show up in a single game. People who like collecting books will play at the same table as people who want only the core book. People who want to sit back and relax will play at the same table as those who want detailed tactics. Magic is going to be unsatisfying for anyone who buys just a single set to play. Snakes &amp; Ladders and Monopoly would be unsatisfying to someone who wants control over winning. An RPG has the potential to bridge all of that. It's also very distinct in that card games and board games don't allow for disregarding rules. RPGs generally explicitly advise disregarding them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264573/#Comment_264573" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T17:17:34+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  5:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cool, some good discussion here.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you feel these genres of play have foundational differences i think there is still much to be leaned and is applicable between them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets contrast the difference between how a board game player purchases a new game and how a role player purchases a new book.

The Long Term Campaign model of "you will play one character with the same four people for four to six hours once a week every week for <i>years</i>" was very pervasive in the traditional RPGs I grew up with. It was hard enough to achieve as a nerdy junior high school kid in the 80s and all but impossible as an adult. It's something I still struggle with, really: if I run a one-shot game or a mini-campaign with a pre-set number of sessions, even if we all have fun I feel like I'm somehow Doing It Wrong.<br><br>A cynical part of me thinks it's because the traditional RPGs I grew up with actually sucked. That they weren't about delivering fun but merely the <i>promise</i> of fun; that if the campaign fell apart after several boring, repetitive dungeons and a 9 hour session where all you did was haggle with some random merchant about the price of arrows and rope it was somehow <i>your fault</i> for giving up before you got to The Good Part, rather than <i>the game's</i> fault for not telling you what The Good Part was and how to get there.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS" title="timeLESS"><img alt="timeLESS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i253.photobucket.com/albums/hh79/gamestribe/cthulhumobster.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timeLESS">timeLESS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264610/#Comment_264610" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T00:28:48+00:00" title="March 31, 2010 12:28AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wittgenstein wrote something that might interest some of you on this topic.
