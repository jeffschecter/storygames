In summary, Replays are:<br/><br/>1) The entirety of a tabletop gaming session, recorded by a player then typed up, and posted as if it were a transcript or screenplay.<br/>2) Players introduce themselves, but as soon as characters are made or chosen, their persona (in the transcript) changes to their character name, even if they speak out of character.<br/>3) Side banter, and game-throwing jokes/heckles? They're included, too. I imagine some editing is going on (like if there's a 10 minute digression on OREO cookies), but for the most part light out-of-character side-banter that goes on at the table makes it into the replay. They don't cut out those bits, as it would be unnatural and silly.<br/>4) It's not just an "example of play", combat, etc: Rather, the entire session from start to finish is included.<br/>5) Online, fan replays tend to lack art, but official or fan-printed replays usually include a few art pieces: Usually one piece for each character (at least a bust), and maybe 1-2 pictures of events from the game, interspersed with the text.<br/>6) Where we might be kind of baffled by folks wanting to read another person's gaming session, in Japan folks are baffled by wanting to read a published adventure: They're empty, they don't show/tell you how to be a better player or GM, and most folks make up their own scenarios anyway". Folks use them as guides to get familiar with a game, or to pick up new tricks from the GM or players.<br/><br/>Anyway, at my house a few months back Jason M asked me about replays, and to show him some examples. About 50 minutes later he was walking funny after I pushed a dozen different styles of replay (explaining each one) in his face.<br/><br/>The followup question Jason asked, which I forgot to answer all this time, was "Do they keep the local slang or accents of folks intact?" Reason is, many of us are either from the South or have lived here some time, and thus players with a thick accent are not uncommon.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is, this is a historic issue in Japan as well. Apparently, the school of thoughts differ: Some folks feel that accents and words should be transcribed in "Hyojungo", the Tokyo Standard way of speaking that doesn't have accents. Those seem to be in the minority. Other folks feel that the replay wouldn't be authentic if they didn't transcribe the players' words as-is; that the accents give the text some life. This is the opinion of a lot of folks outside of Tokyo. It's interesting to note that most of the major RPG companies aside from FEAR (Tokyo) are in Osaka, which is well known for its distinctive accent and way of speaking.<br/><br/>English: Wow, that's great!<br/>Tokyo: Hontou ni iin da ne!<br/>Osaka: Honma ni een yade!<br/><br/>Basically, an Osakan accent is... well, people say it's like a Brooklyn accent. However, I feel that it's more like a Brooklyn accent <b>combined with</b> a Louisiana/Texas accent, and furthermore adopting Queen's English vocabulary. That's the American take on it, anyway. The UK has a longer history, so over there it would by like a Londoner vs someone from Glasgow, I'd wager.<br/><br/>Anyway, for the most part, most folks will keep the players' accents intact. Even in osaka, they laugh about how some early/groundbreaking replays were in such a thick Osakan accent that it was hard for The Straights in Tokyo to follow without giggling.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236975/#Comment_236975" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T06:49:08+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  6:49AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Andy!<br/><br/>There's a replay in Fiasco that meets most of these points, although it isn't a literal transcript.

They use their own systems, and the character sheets provide most of the rules/data-bits on it.<br/><br/>Anyway, in both games, the game is divided about 70-30 into Replay and Rules/Setting. The Replay takes up most of the book, and in fatc is the FIRST thing you read when you open it. When you're done with the replay, thanks to the play session and the breakdown of combat and stuff in sidebars, you have a good feel for what the game is like, how it runs. Then, when you get to the rules section, it's like it's filling in the blanks and giving you more to work with. A very refreshing turn on the way it's normally done.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.bouken.jp/pd/sg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bouken.jp/pd/sg/</a>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Although consuming replays<i>as entertainment</i>strikes me as weird, as an instructional tool they make a lot of sense, akin to watching a video that illustrates not just procedural content but also social behavior.</blockquote>\nWell, when it comes down to it, I'm not sure how many folks are in it for the pure entertainment. I mean, in some cases that's how they're marketed (like Sanae's "Fantasy Chick" series of replays), but in the end I think that it comes down to idea mining from cover to cover. Hmmmm.

I am rewriting my game right now. This is brilliant! Putting the example AFTER the rule it illustrates is actually a stupid convention, now that I think about it. Having an example of a whole play-instance, a session or even just a whole scene, and then putting the rules in AFTERWARDS to show how it was done, actually makes more sense.<br/><br/>I wrote a paper a few years back showing (among other things) that an effective structure for tutorial interactions is to show the goal first, then explain backwards through the causal chain. "Here's how it's supposed to be. To get it that way, start with it mostly right and then do X. To get it mostly right, start with it halfway right and do Y..." And of course, this is how you implement that for RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237099/#Comment_237099" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T21:43:38+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  9:43PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Well, I for one found the recording of the complete Polaris game that Paul put online years ago both informative AND entertaining.
