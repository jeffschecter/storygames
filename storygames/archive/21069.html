This is still the place for discussion of RISS!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><small>This is version 1.3 of what used to be called <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20257/gdns-official-canonical-theory" rel="nofollow">GDNS official, canonical theory</a> and is now renamed RISS official, canonical theory.</small><br/><br/>Because getting on the same page about which techniques are kosher and which are iffy is SUPER IMPORTANT to us humans! It's the outside-in approach to finding common value ground!<br/><br/>Now what is RISS? It stands for Rails, Impro, Sandbox and Spike!<br/><br/>In Rails, one or more of the participants is a super talented story writer in the attic and pre-writes a very interesting story that the group can then bring to life and experience in full color at the gaming table! This could be a GM writing "First the players are gonna do X, then they're gonna do Y, then they're gonna do Z" style notes before play, this could be a player writing ten pages of backstory for their character which is going to be recounted closely during play!<br/><br/>In Impro, one or more of the participants is a hippie! They want to encounter choices that would be meaningful diegetically, such as "Should the hard-working cop abandon her family in order to protect them?". The most important life dream of a Impro hippie is that a very unexpected story is created during play that can then be retold to your hippie friends at the next con!<br/><br/>In Spike, one or more of the participants is a power-hungry munchkin! They want to encounter choices that would be meaningful mechanically, such as "Should the hard-working cop equip a +1 one beastmaster sword or a x3 mod lightning round gun in order to best protect her family?". The most important life dream of a Spike munchkin is to test their own might! To face challenges and bravely stare them down with their lifelong journey of system mastery!<br/><br/>In Sandbox, one or more of the participants is a curious individual! They want to examine the clockwork of the system, how will the little ants in the sandhill move around and what will happen when they collide! The most important life dream of a curious and imaginative Sandbox daydreamer is to see their doll's house come to life and see the dolls do What They Would've Done Really. If they were alive. But with spaceships.<br/><br/>Wait, there's more!<br/>These four corners of the RISS quartet may sound like mortal enemies. But that's not the case, they are the best of friends!<br/>Here is the official poster for the RISS kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/riss_friendship.png"/><br/><br/>But not everything is a paradise in the RISS land!<br/>Here is the official diagram of the official RISS Hatred Parade of Eternal Enmity:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/riss_enmity.png"/><br/><br/>Any questions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462188/#Comment_462188" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T10:45:39+00:00" title="April 20, 2017 10:45AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>List of techniques!</b><br/><br/>Game design techniques:<br/><strong>Sandbox</strong><br/>\u2022 Tools to make random tables<br/>\u2022 Quantification (not necessarily slow-handling)<br/><strong>Spike</strong><br/>\u2022 Comprehensive mechanics<br/>\u2022 Playtesting<br/>\u2022 Flexible mechanics that can work together in different ways<br/>\u2022 Encounter generators<br/>\u2022 "Overlord" rules<br/>\u2022 Character advancement <i>(added 2016-06-13)</i><br/><strong>Impro</strong><br/>\u2022 Restrictive character/setting generation<br/>\u2022 Character change <i>(added 2016-06-13)</i><br/><strong>Rails</strong><br/>\u2022 Compelling settings<br/>\u2022 Epic stories<br/>\u2022 Strong villains<br/>\u2022 Simple monster math (Numenera-style)<br/>\u2022 Hidden monster math<br/>\u2022 Plot generators<br/>\u2022 Character backstory <i>(renamed and moved 2016-06-13)</i><br/><strong>Play to find out</strong><br/>\u2022 Randomness, chance<br/>\u2022 Easy to adjudicate, consistent mechanics<br/>\u2022 Impartial refeereing <i>(added 2016-06-13)</i><br/><strong>Stories are interesting</strong><br/>\u2022 Intra-party-bonds/relationships<br/><strong>Players interact with the DM's prep</strong><br/>\u2022 Secrets to be uncovered <i>(added 2016-06-13)</i><br/>\u2022 Other prep tools<br/>\u2022 Sources for maps<br/>\u2022 Easy rules for making NPCs<br/><br/><br/>DM/facilitator/group techniques:<br/><strong>Sandbox</strong><br/>\u2022 Random tables<br/>\u2022 Prepping<br/><strong>Spike</strong><br/>\u2022 Interesting tactics<br/><strong>Impro</strong><br/>\u2022 Bangs<br/>\u2022 Loaded questions<br/>\u2022 Unique character traits<br/>\u2022 Decisions with high diegetic costs<br/><strong>Rails</strong><br/>\u2022 Hidden rolls<br/>\u2022 False choices<br/>\u2022 Balanced combats<br/>\u2022 Curated experience<br/>\u2022 Selective fudging<br/>\u2022 Strong questgivers<br/>\u2022 Bones thrown at other "player types"<br/><strong>Play to find out</strong><br/>\u2022 Open rolls<br/>\u2022 Ruthlessness<br/>\u2022 Everway "Karma" <i>(added 2016-06-13)</i><br/>\u2022 Everway "Fortune" <i>(added 2016-06-13)</i><br/><strong>Stories are interesting</strong><br/>\u2022 Scenario setups<br/>\u2022 Everway "Drama" <i>(added 2016-06-13)</i><br/><strong>Players interact with the DM's prep</strong><br/>\u2022 Other prep tools<br/>\u2022 Sources for maps<br/>\u2022 Maps<br/>\u2022 NPCs<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462197/#Comment_462197" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T13:53:14+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  1:53PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "Spike" name for that corner is already chafing because I think both Jenny and Spike psychographic profiles fit there.

I.e. if there are some apples on the altar, in two game groups' SIS. In the impro group, they were just made up on the spot, in the sandbox group, the dungeon key might say "four apples in a white onyx bowl [bowl worth 280gp, weighs 1lb]". And in both groups the players ask: I grab one apple, what color is it? And in both groups the facilitator or DM (respectively) says, even though the prep in the Sandbox group doesn't have the color listed, even though the apple in the Impro group was just made up, says without shame, without batting an eyelash, without breaking poker face: "It's red, what do you do?" That's not swerving. That's "be boring", that's building platform, that's saying the obvious thing. Swerving is when that apple suddenly contains a diamond. Which is awesome in an impro group, untruthful in a sandbox group.

The former isn't "Rails", the latter might seem foreign to you and I haven't found it described on the Forge or here on S-G but I <em>have</em> seen it here, enough that my subconscious mind used it when she wrote the official, canonical theory.<br/><br/>It can take three forms:<br/><br/>\u2022 (non-improvised) flashbacks<br/>\u2022 playing through pre-scripted events (also see <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/462382/#Comment_462382" rel="nofollow">my reply to Potemkin above</a>, for an example from LARPS), or "playing through a destiny" beat for beat.<br/>\u2022 and, perhaps most commonly, revealing a pre-written (non-improvised) backstory or side story piecemeal through play. E.g. at first acting all fucked up and then gradually revealing/recounting the tragic truth why they became that way (yes this can be pretty ablist). I.e. first room in the dungeon they talk about "When I got to school one day", second room of dungeon they talk about "Everyone was silent. No one said a word. I said hi, but just got glances", third room of dungeon they say "When I opened the set of frosted glass doors to the cafeteria, I realized why." Fourth room of dungeon they.. you get the picture.<br/><br/>Wait, I guess that third form is flashbacks. But by flashbacks I meant playing through (railroading through) flashbacks and by the third form I mean recounting/revealing the past, or a story-in-the-story, as mimetic diegesis (my apologies for that phrase) while the SIS is somewhere else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462402/#Comment_462402" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-24T17:16:22+00:00" title="April 24, 2017  5:16PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2017 5:17PM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It doesn't always appear as pages of backstory they want to read.

We add an element to the tomb exploration that allows her to further her personal soap opera. She finds a mirror in the tomb that allows her mortal self to communicate with her goddess side. To motivate her to keep up with the [railroad tracks <em>(2097's clarifying edit)</em>], we'll try to have the bandits take it from her.

The name is Latin for "said", as in "nice day, she said". But the meaning of the name is not related to what I was talking about, I was talking about a particular game.<br/><br/>Gnusto is, as you guessed, a name from an earlier version -- I've changed names for the corners two times and for a while I deliberately wanted really alien names, to prevent what's already been going on here, people having formed connotations to words like "Rails" and "Impro". The names from that version came from an eighties video game's fictional magican language. I happened to be wearing a t-shirt that day that said Gnusto&amp;Nitfol&amp;Blorb&amp;Frotz. But, Gnusto does mean to write, or copy by writing, in that game (Enchanter is the one from the series that I played [about halfway], Zork is the first game in the series.)<br/><br/>Zilch\u2026 I broke the rules when talking about zilch and zilch play, and I broke them in a couple of ways 1. because it's a term coined on The Forge forum, and S-G:s rule is to always state what we mean when we use Forge words, 2. I was being a bit passive aggressive towards WM and I was being a bit shibbolethy towards those that I thought would understand my frustration, 3. I was using a concept I'm not sure I fully understand and that's never a good idea. Anyway, 'zilch'  and 'zilchplay' originates from an American slang word for zero or nothing. I used it a bit out of it's ordinary usage I guess. I guess it means the sort of play where you have your friends and your chips and that's good but you're not engaging with the game itself.<br/><br/>Gloracle is a word minted here on S-G. "The glorious oracle of dice and prep"; part of the old school (or OSR) ethos is that once play has started, the DM should be a neutral referee and no longer a creator. If the text says "the statuette is in the third drawer from the top in the mahogany desk in the guest bedroom", that's where it is. No amount of searching in the kitchen can find the statuette. If the prep says that strangers have pocket contents from a particular random table, and the players pickpocket a stranger, well, that's what they get, a random roll from that table. It's about the DM no longer "inventing" or "changing" "reality".<br/><br/>Shibboleth is a\u2026 bible story thing? In the story, those who were familiar with a particular phrase recognized each other. Judges 12 is the book but, the phrase has taken on a wider meaning for all sorts of "in-group passwords". Avoiding people being excluded by shibbolethy language is the primary reason for S-G's rule against weird terms. And it's a good rule and I try my best.<br/><br/>Jeph, thanks again so much and let me know if there's more. We can't rely on people asking, I messed up, definitely, and I apologize. You went above and beyond and I appreciate it.<br/><br/>James, for me who doesn't speak English, every word is like this. Even the word "word".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462441/#Comment_462441" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-25T15:57:32+00:00" title="April 25, 2017  3:57PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you!<br/><br/>And it's kinda impossible to not get shibboleth-y when discussing such a sprawling topic with such a big corpus.

I can expand, but the point I'm labouring is that these categories radically change when considered through the player-experience and the GM-experience. What 'Impro' looks and feels like for a player is radically different for a GM and I'm not sure your taxonomy illustrates this. Addressing the duality at the core of the genre might help bring more clarity? \n<blockquote><br/>...when I sit down to play an RPG I have to make some choices for that particular session or for that particular campaign or group.

In commenting, I must confess to being partly motivated by pique - these taxonomical threads with their focus on neologisms and devoid of An Actual Game give me strong Forge vibes, and that's not what I lurk in S-G for.

                   It's because my favorite An Actual Game of all time is D&amp;D 5e which is such an aimless mess that it can be twisted to any of the corners (by blatantly ignoring parts of it).<br/><br/>I.e. you can (as I have) make it not-Rails by ignoring texts like the two Tyranny of Dragons books.<br/>You can (as I have) make it not-Impro by being more restrictive about "leaving blanks" in the prep and being more obedient to the gloracle.<br/>You can make it not-Sandbox by going all-in on "leaving blanks" or on the scripted story, or by fudging dice.<br/>etc etc.<br/><br/>This mishmashiness is good because it can help you from reinventing a lot of wheels for many different mixes of corners and styles but it's tricky because it requires clarity about social contract. Hence RISS. It <i>is</i> about "helping players motivated by different aesthetics play harmoniously". It's just that the <i>corners</i> aren't player types. A player's interests for a particular setting can be in any of the fifteen possible combinations of corners (including in ways that clash, like I had one player for a while who wanted and expected incompatible things\u2014talking about this stuff really helped and brought that player back).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462494/#Comment_462494" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T15:17:06+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  3:17PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...like I had one player for a while who wanted and expected incompatible things\u2014talking about this stuff really helped and brought that player back).</blockquote>\nI'd love to hear more about that!<br/><br/>I have to say I agree that the GM experience of running a game using a particular set of techniques is often quite different than the player experience... but let's also not forget that many very important Improv based games are also GM-less!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462496/#Comment_462496" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T15:46:16+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  3:46PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I'm concerned he reads S-G and it's a player I don't want to lose again.<br/>And I'm still not sure I understand.<br/>But to my understanding, I think it was this:<br/><br/>1. He wanted a prepared story rather than what I wanted: emergence<br/>2. But, he also was allergic to temporal quantum.

It's about what techniques feel, and I want to find a less cultural-appropriating expression here but for now: what techniques feel <i>kosher</i> to a particular game intent. The intent (or, in Big Model terms, the "CA") is left deliberately vague/unstated but there is still this feeling of "no you're ruining it for everybody" when opposed techniques are used, and the opposite of that feeling when the techniques are aligned.<br/><br/>How about this: RISS is the skinner to GNS' Jung? RISS is the outside-in approach, the bottom-up approach.\n<blockquote>My personal, probably strongly biased opinion is that any successful CA-style model</blockquote>\nBut I'm not doing personality archetypes <em>directly</em>, I'm doing them indirectly. The feeling you get when you walk past a table and you see their DM fudge the dice\u2026 for some (for me) it's "Oh, NO, don't!" and for some it's "Yes, nice! Don't let the dice rule you".<br/><br/>Or a dedicated Impro-player's thoughts against prep or blocking.<br/><br/>That gut-wrenching feeling on the <i>practical</i> level is what I'm going for here. That "No, that MESSES the game RIGHT UP!"-feeling that can be felt against any of the corners depending on who you are, and the feeling of "Aw yiss, that's SOLID PLAY, MAN!" feeling that "your" corner can give you.\n<blockquote>Also what Mike said about An Actual Game, but I also realize that you're basing this on Lots of Actual Games, not pulling it out of thin air.

Some games are very clear about one agenda and thus less fodder both for the sinking feeling of wrong-corner and the elated feeling of perfect-fit-corner. I mean, hopefully there is <i>some</i> of the latter or you wouldn't be playing that game, but when you get the perfect-fit-corner experience in a vague or drifty game, it can feel especially relieving or cool or interesting. Or maybe I'm wrong about this particular last paragraph, this particular paragraph isn't the most thought through.

Design has many constraints and various goals of various aspects of the activity can guide design. (Example aspects: Physical tactility of activity, mental strain during activity, ludonarrative of the activity, mimetodiegetic narrative of the activity, social confrontation during the activity, time spent doing activity etc etc.)<br/><br/>But consider back in the early days of Braunstein, Slobbovia, Blackmoor and Greyhawk. They stumbled upon something completely fresh by messing around with a new mix of old techniques. Then focused design can create an even more focused set of rules and techniques to foster any one particular "fresh thing".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462716/#Comment_462716" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T06:09:36+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  6:09AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't rember in which thread we talked about player-side prescripting but <a href="http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2017/02/08/7s-story-considerations/" rel="nofollow">this blogpost about 7S talks about something similar</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462733/#Comment_462733" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T16:33:45+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  4:33PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>To clarify, would you say that it's lower-case "s" sandbox or that it's in the Blorb corner?

Can you unpack that? I can never remember what your abstract words mean. Blorb is Sandbox, right?<br/><br/>Our game was an old-school D&amp;D hexcrawl sandbox, but anyone in the group could organize a game and GM. So, this week I might bring in a module and create a mountain next to the town, placing the module there. The players could use their characters from previous sessions (if it made sense for them to be present), or make entirely new characters if they wished. <br/><br/>It helped that we started with a "blank slate" - none of the characters were locals or knew what was going on; they were exploring unmapped territory.<br/><br/>Four days later, we might have another session, and you might take a turn GMing - you wouldn't be running that adventure, because it's my turf. I'll make a character to play, and you might have your own methods, like a bunch of random tables for wilderness exploration. You'll also, perhaps, ask me a bunch of questions about what's around the mountain (which I might need to define to make the module I picked make sense). We end up South of the mountain, which turns out to be a deep forest, where some adventure is generated from some random encounters.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we both go home to prep in more detail in relation to our sandbox locations.<br/><br/>When we get together a third time, both you and I are present, so the other players might act out a conversation in-character and try to figure out what to pursue next. Maybe all the characters who went into the Mountain suffered a TPK and we don't know what happened to them. So, they assemble an expedition to go find out.<br/><br/>In that case, I would GM that session, following my module for the inside of the mountain.<br/><br/>Over time, the world would grow and develop in detail, with various groups of adventurers engaged in different adventures run by different GMs.<br/><br/>We made great efforts to keep the world consistent and logical, so that would often require asking questions of each other about what was where, what the people in a certain place were like, and so forth. I might be GMing, but I have to ask you what's going on North of the town so I can keep my materials consistent with what we've created before (particularly if I wasn't present at a relevant session!).<br/><br/>Over time, the sandbox fills up with all kinds of different locations and possible adventures. We negotiate, session-by-session, who might be GMing and what characters are present depending on what we decide to explore. Often it's a character who chooses for us: "I, the noble Brandwey, have decided to go deliver such-and-such village from the raiders who are invading the peninsula. I'm willing to pay strong men and women who will join me." "Ok, so which characters would join in?" "Both of my characters were last seen deep in the Mines by the canyon over here, so it wouldn't make sense for them to be here. I'll make a new character." And so on.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>But consider back in the early days of Braunstein, Slobbovia, Blackmoor and Greyhawk.

Let's say you want to invent Burning Wheel. As Guy points out, it's one of the pre-catalogued examples of kumbaya of FRIENDSHIP.<br/><br/>First, to invent BW, you want to combine Spike (will be renamed Skill-testing) with Sandbox. What's a normal trap there? Spikes will see the Sandboxy encounters as unfair. Sandboxers will see Spikes obsession with balance suffocating. I think BW doesn't use random encounters or location based encounters but rather tries to challenge the player characters specifically. So it makes a choice and compromises away that particular technique of Sandbox and selects "a difficult, skill-testing challenge" over "a consistent and true gameworld", while keeping other Sandbox-adjecent techniques (perhaps not the <em>core</em> one, but there's a little sandboxiness there.<br/><br/>Second, to invent BW, you also want to combine this challenging play that requires system mastery (both mastery of fictional positioning to get FoRKs and learning all the moving pieces and best tactics and heuristics for success within that complex system -- i.e. what good routines in Fight! are typically good in various situations vs particular GMs etc) with "leave-blanks", character-specific, belief-challenging morality play. You look at the Hatred Parade. Flashlight droppers endanger the patry. A serious conflict between the two techniques. So you <em>need</em> to adress this. Ban flashlight dropping, mitigate flashlight dropping, or embrace flashlight dropping. Obv we know now with BW's BITs and artha that they did the latter. "Belief: Will drop everything and run if faced with eldritch danger". They built the challenge around this issue and incorporated it into the challenge play. Good job btw, one of the parts of BW I really love.<br/><br/>Third, to invent BW, you also want to combine the character-specific morality play of the Impro corner (typically implemented with "leave blanks") with the sandboxy feeling of natural-sounding consequences. Looking at the official diagram, we see that there are two common issues. From the sandbox direction, no myth makes sandbox interactions absurd. Traditional finchian sandbox play ("tangibility play") depends, I've come to believe but this is still unsettled here on S-G, on big myth and prep. But, sticking to a prepped "physical" game world slows down the human drama; clunky reality gets in the way of the human emotions. Now, we know BW chose the latter, it's a light-prep game (once you've mastered it) and prep is more often linear than anything resembling an OSR hexcrawl or a keyed and tabled dungeon map. Instead, it uses it's very detailed resolution system to convey the sense of reality and groundedness and to keep the gonzo in check. Lifepaths, beliefs, a very strong "play to find out" -- not play to find out what you can come up with, but play to find out what results <em>the system can produce</em> enable this sandboxy feeling successfully, in a way that's very different from the D\u2192D/H\u2192H I have as my benchmark for "tangibility". Happily, this complex system also synergizes with the design goal of system mastery and challenging play.<br/><br/>So put a bow on it and we've got Burning Wheel.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I feel like, if I were to try to design a cool innovative game, I'd get more mileage out of <i>challenging</i> the assertions of the Hatred Parade than following them.</p></div></blockquote>\nYep. That's what I've been working on for months now, as described in "Currently Prepping"-thread. I'm putting together Hillfolk and D&amp;D with all of the dysergies and clashes that implies. I've looked at the official diagram and see the following two Eternal Emnity points. "No Myth makes sandbox interactions absurd". So I'm going to do big myth, using a shelf-ful of 2e boxes and plenty of OSR material. It's going to be human drama <em>in a hard landscape</em>. "Clunky reality gets in the way of human emotions". Yes, if the players get separated by three days of random Salt Water Surface 1d8+1d12 encounters, it's harder to have an emotional talk about validating each other in the workplace. But so be it. "Addressing the premise" is going to be delayed, messed with, threatened, eaten by sharks, sea elves and Sauhagin, but still attempted.<br/><br/>And maybe it won't be a good game. I want to <em>try</em> it!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><b>Spike + Rails</b> sounds like the way many people play D&amp;D4E to me.

Here's what I got:<br/><br/>Let's imagine a game similar to Star Wars d6. The group is improvising along, telling the story together, the DM is holding everything lightly, nothing is prepped. There might be the ocassional skill check but with deterministically set DCs (think: the 7-9 &amp; 10+ of PbtA, there's never "on a 5-10 you X, on an 11+ you Y" -- this game would have something similar but for SW's dice pools) and the outcomes from that would, just like PbtA, trigger more story. So far, so mashup of SWd6 and a traditional MC-move-driven PbtA game. But here's the new part. Let's say the group improvises that the PCs are assigned a stealth mission on Maltooine where they have to steal some blaster rifles from a Stormtrooper garrison; a stealth mission that might very well degenerate into combat with some failed sneak rolls. The new mechanic would then quickly (much faster than the random dungeon tables at the back of the AD&amp;D DMG), without subjective input (nor prep) on behalf of the DM, spit out a couple of rooms and the opposition in them and you would plop out a battle mat and play it out skilltestingly, "Every Square is 5 Feet" style as per Ben's article.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><b>Rails+Sandbox</b> makes me think of <i>Always/Never/Now</i> - I can imagine a much more intense or thorough design of that game.

After the open play area, the group then follows a new linear sequence to the next open play area.<br/><br/>Let's say the group is investigating the mysterious rising of R'Lyeh. First there's an open play area where they can ask around the various caf\xe9s and artisan coffee toasters around the Florida Keys area. Here PCs can do what ever the players want, fall in love, break into houses etc etc. Then the clues lead them and the DM nudges them to the Azores. There they can again investigate, look around, also do shenanigans. Then the clues lead them to the next place etc etc.<br/><br/>A published example of this is Flight 13. The airport is a small sandboxy place but the PCs <em>have</em> to get on that plane by the end of the day. Then the events on the plane is very railroaded. Then they arrive in a sandboxy Austin which they can adventure in, fight monsters in etc in a sandboxy way. Then the sequence with the [spoiler omitted] is again completely railroaded.<br/><br/>The other model I call "tracks in the sand". First, you make a very solid sandbox that can, as any sandbox, handle anything. Then inside that sandbox you write traditional 90:s railroad adventures. If the players go off track, they can then do what the ywant to do in the sandbox. If they happen to get back on track later, well, then the train is there for them. If there is some time limit or something they do which makes the events of the railroad go awray, such as the bad guy fininhing her doomsday device, well, that happens and is now part of play. The railroad, in the "tracks in the sand" model, is a collection of suggested events on a suggested timeline. Not something that the players needs to be kept on by GM force (visible or curtained).<br/><br/>(To be clear about what "tracks in the sand" is. In one way to run rails illusionistically and with force, the DM holds "the reality of the world" lightly and uses techniques such as Quantum Ogre in order to make the events of the railroad happen.<br/><br/>In "tracks in the sand", conversely the DM holds the "tracks" lightly while the facts of the world and the sandbox around it are and remain canon and the players are free to do what they want in that world as if it were any other sandbox. It seems to me than rather to use "tracks" in this way I'd want to just put in loaded, open-ended <i>setups</i> rather than a full "this might happen, this might happen, this might happen"-story.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><b>Sandbox+Impro</b> sounds a lot like <i>Apocalypse World</i>, depending on how much of "Impro" is about developing good story and how much of it is about making stuff up on the fly all the time (AW tends to do both, of course).</p></div></blockquote>\nI don't think AW is this but...<br/>Well, by "Impro" I mean having very premise-focused player characters, very loaded relationships, trying to "address premise" etc. AW with its bonds do this to some extent. And normally all of the "rules of physics" of sandbox get in the way of that. Or, more often, are unnecessary since you can satisfy the goal of the game's design without it, for example how AW does it with building platform together.<br/><br/>But, if a group truly values the sandboxy aspect of play but <em>also</em> want to create characters that, just through living, tell a story about the choices they make and the relationship they have with each other? You could make a place, a strong place using all of the techniques in the OSR prep box, and then also create these strong PC:s and set them lose in that sandbox and let them try to address premise in spite of all cumbersome logistics and dangerous nepharites and skeletons in their city. Like, Block by Bloody Block or some other "WoD when WoD is at its best"-games attempt to do this. WoD is often pure rails but a nice political, fully fleshed out city by night book that also leaves place (not "leave blanks" -- just leaves place because the physics of the sandbox might in some games operate on an axis orthogonal to the chemistry between the PC:s) for the emotional turmoil within the coterie and between childer and sire.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462779/#Comment_462779" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T22:40:44+00:00" title="May  1, 2017 10:40PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2017 10:42PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>All skill-testing isn't about mechanical "buildy" self-expression.

Sf wants "Make it possible and difficult", while Sb just drives around in the parking lot with the windows down and middle fingers up. It's often incidentally challenging, which appeals to Sf. But balance is not an inherent part of Sb's contract. <br/><br/>And, Sb and Sf can often work together by identifying this mismatch and coming to an agreement, either Sandbox gets their way and there's no balance guarantee leaving Skills to make their own fun, setting their own goals and going for them, or Skills gets their way and there is some sorta rule in place.

I think this short post really gets to the heart of what you're going for in a really nice way:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Every RPG is about "play to find out" in some sense.<br/>R: Play to find out how the others react to the pre-scripted events both IC and OOC<br/>I: Play to find out what story our storytelling chemistry creates when we get together<br/>S: Play to find out what concretely, solidly, tangibly <em>happens</em><br/>S: Play to find out who wins, and how<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI think that the second and fourth options make a great deal of sense.<br/><br/>However, the first and third are problematic, I think. <br/><br/>For "R", why would this kind of play rely on "pre-scripting"? Is it any different if, say, a GM is inventing the storyline as we play through it? That kind of play would feel identical to the players and only slightly different for the GM. (Indeed, in most railroady games I've see, GMs switch fluidly between "pre-scripted" material and improvised material all the time.)<br/><br/>For the first "S", I'd argue that you are committing the same sin most "RPG theorists" do (and then criticize each other for <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ). When you're talking about "truth" in roleplaying, that's not a description of how or why we play - it's a value judgement. It's you saying, "This kind of roleplaying feels most real for me."<br/><br/>I think that if you want your theory to hold water, you have to figure out how to express this idea (if it indeed exists) in a way which:<br/><br/>a) Gives people who align with the idea a description they can identify with and celebrate. ("Yes! That's what we do.")<br/>b) Gives people who play a different way a clear sense that this is NOT what they are doing.<br/><br/>Describing play as "feeling tangible" or "feeling real" is close to the idea of "immersion", and one which very, very few people would actually say they *aren't looking for*. Of course I want my gaming to feel tangible, real, true!<br/><br/>It's not that far removed from saying "I like gaming which is fun for me, where the stuff that's happening feels really cool."<br/><br/><br/>Now, interestingly enough, I've seen some of this clash in play. For instance, when Dave and I play games together I often feel (correct me if I'm wrong, Dave) that I'm looking for a higher quotient of "tangibility" (the illusion that the imagined reality is "real" or "solid") in our collaborative, story-oriented games. <br/><br/>We talked about this recently with a game we're playtesting together, where I'm trying to set up so that die rolls create fictional outcomes (include a list to choose from), and Dave's response was, "I'd rather just see the roll determine who gets to decide how it turns out".<br/><br/>He had a good point - in some ways, it suits the game better - but it illustrates a different point of view. I wonder if "tangibility" is a concept as murky and complex as "immersion", or if it can be nailed down to a level we could actually agree on?<br/><br/>I suspect it has something to do with things like:<br/><br/>a) When we play, how binding is fictional positioning - do we embrace a commitment to established fictional details together, moment-to-moment, and treat it as sacrosanct?<br/><br/>b) Do we commit to maintaining the illusion, together, that the imagined stuff is concrete and that our contributions to it are always made as explorers, rather than creators?<br/><br/>c) Do we stick strictly to "operating within a stance", when the game calls for it?<br/><br/>d) To what extent do we see prior input into the fiction as binding future contributions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462858/#Comment_462858" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T17:37:46+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  5:37PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave's got a more thorough handle on this stuff than most people I know, so I'm sure he'll chime in and illuminate us all sooner or later. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462859/#Comment_462859" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T17:37:55+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  5:37PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, Skillfrotz can be satisfied with that OSRish player skill.

For instance, if the sandbox only contains "unarmed commoners with romantic problems", but the player wants to test their ability for violence, then the GM has already screwed up. But let's say that this extreme case thought experiment came about in some understandable way, and we aren't willing to retcon or redraw the lines: it's still not hard to see how a player and a GM working together can find opportunities for violent confrontation. <br/><br/>It might be as simple as them working together to identify such opportunities: "Well, Chad is in love with Lucy, and he's got two burly brothers who are construction workers. I bet if you did something bad to Lucy, they might reconsider their pacifist ways." Or it might be a case of them effectively negotiating what a challenge actually looks like, given this fictional setup. ("You want to fight those guys? That's a cakewalk for you; they don't even know how to fight. Maybe you should set your sights on taking over the whole neighbourhood, instead?")<br/><br/>And, of course, the negotiation doesn't have to be so overt, right? It could be played out, moment-by-moment, instead, with the GM describing the way the burly brothers' watch each other's backs at the bar, or mentioning that they are members at the local boxing gym, or whatever other thing.<br/><br/>The point is that, when the players (GM included) are all "in on the deal", it's not too hard to "direct the camera" towards those situations and those details we're all actually interested in, and finding valid challenges isn't that hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462864/#Comment_462864" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T17:51:30+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  5:51PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt: Right!

When you're talking about "truth" in roleplaying, that's not a description of how or why we play - it's a value judgement. It's you saying, "This kind of roleplaying feels most real for me."<br/><br/>I think that if you want your theory to hold water, you have to figure out how to express this idea (if it indeed exists) in a way which:<br/><br/>a) Gives people who align with the idea a description they can identify with and celebrate. ("Yes! That's what we do.")<br/>b) Gives people who play a different way a clear sense that this is NOT what they are doing.<br/><br/>Describing play as "feeling tangible" or "feeling real" is close to the idea of "immersion", and one which very, very few people would actually say they *aren't looking for*. Of course I want my gaming to feel tangible, real, true!<br/><br/>It's not that far removed from saying "I like gaming which is fun for me, where the stuff that's happening feels really cool."</div></blockquote>\nThe sense I've gotten from the past month of posts is that what we're talking about here is "what is the causal structure we attempt to apply to find out what we agree happens next?" and the Sandbox answer is "Try to use the physics analogue the GM has created." This includes how objects react to each other. It includes the initial state of the world as populated by the GM. It includes populating parts of the world the GM forgot/neglected, by random tables, what would be there as if something reasonable was in the initial state and then interacted with the world via the physics analogue, etc. It explicitly DOES NOT take as input past or counterfactual player actions except as filtered through characters and the physics analogue - so previous low morale at the table cannot produce an easier encounter now, but previous poisoning players saying their characters poisoned a water supply definitely could. Counterfactual "players would find it tense if the villain turned out to be following them all along" cannot make it more likely the villain is currently following them, but "the villain in physics analogue would notice the characters are searching for something powerful hidden and would generate as a possible strategy 'follow them'" can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462884/#Comment_462884" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T20:25:49+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  8:25PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guy, nice!<br/><br/>You make attaining Sandboxblorb glory seem impossibly difficult <i>but</i> as a shining beacon in the distance (which in and of itself is useful), you outline it perfectly!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462885/#Comment_462885" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T20:28:43+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  8:28PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You also make Sandboxblorb sound like how I understood Karma as described in the original Everway text (not sure how usage drifted on rgfa and Forge).<br/><br/>The other three RISS corners don't map as clearly to Everway's techniques, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mneme" title="mneme"><img alt="mneme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mneme">mneme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463358/#Comment_463358" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-15T16:38:31+00:00" title="May 15, 2017  4:38PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2017 4:39PM by mneme.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, that was...a longer thread than I expected.  But I did want to know what the RISS people were talking about in other threads was.  A few reactions, maybe going backwards a bit:<br/><br/>1. Everway is pretty much everything -but- a sandbox.  I mean, it's possible to detail out a sandbox of Realms and Spheres with pre-known worlds and detailed locations and Ursupers in them.  But I've never seen anyone do this;  In practice, the card and image centricism of the game tends to make it focused on Rails and Impro (with a bit of Spike on the edges)  If anything, I think of the Everway resolutions not as a set of technique choices, but as a hierarchy that leads to Impro-style play as a rule -- if the result of an action is Obvious and there's no reason to deviate from it, you go with that (Karma); if instead there's a solid dramatic reason to either break the "obvious" result or it would be in doubt, but there's a strongest narrative choice, go with Drama.  FInally, if neither of those two provide a solid answer, you add in a Fortune card (which fundamentally means using the fortune card and the situation to produce a Karma or Drama answer; the designers have cleverly hidden the designed-in Karma clues on the cards in order to encourage Drama results here; again pointing to an Impro/Rails focus).  <br/><br/>2. 2097, I appreciate the familiarity involved in using people's personal names, but as a from-the-beginning s-g tourist, it tends to come off as confusing and shibbolethy.  People don't have "real names" associated with their nicks that I can see, so mostly it means I'm never sure who Sandra or Josh (I mean, I'm a Josh, but that's not the point) or Dave are.<br/><br/>3. As far as I know, while both were from Infocom, the Spellcaster series wasn't part of the Great Underground universe that was Zork (which was itself based on public domain games like Dungeon and Collossal Cave).<br/><br/>4. It seems to me that Rails really needs clarification down to its basics (like Spike does); the funny starter description obscures a really clever distillation of the technique.  Fundamentally, it's Rails (and I have to wonder if you can keep the RISS name by moving Rails into Story and something else onto the R letter) if someone has a strong idea of where the story should go and the group accedes to this idea--whether this is traditional top-down rails, or a Fate compel, or people playing out their personal story as described by Lady Blackbird Keys.  It's all about being a strong storyteller/plotter and deciding on story elements based on that sense of structure -- opposed to Impro, which more embodies AW's central concept of "Keep it feral" and never letting anyone decide where the story is going to go in advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P

game, are about honoring what\u2019s already there. The \u201cAlways say what your prep demands\u201d of Apocalypse World; if you open the hood of an old rusted up Wv beetle and the prep says that there\u2019s a horse skull in there, well, that\u2019s what\u2019s there.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>2097, I appreciate the familiarity involved in using people\u2019s personal names, but as a from-the-beginning s-g tourist, it tends to come off as confusing and shibbolethy. People don\u2019t have \u201creal names\u201d associated with their nicks that I can see, so mostly it means I\u2019m never sure who Sandra or Josh (I mean, I\u2019m a Josh, but that\u2019s not the point) or Dave are.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, it\u2019s weird. I got a bit jarred by it when I first started posting at S-G, and I didn\u2019t like it at first. But I quickly found that I really liked being called by my name. People found out my name from my email adress or some other way (I think you could have a title under your nickname for a while and I had put my name there). On the Forge, this practice was insisted upon, sometimes in a pretty pushy way. Here, I find, it\u2019s mostly about familiarity and friendliness. But the practice didn\u2019t come from me and at first I was kinda resisting it, sticking to people\u2019s forum names. The good part about a forum name, like mneme, is that it\u2019s self-selected.</p>\n<p>But you\u2019re right, especially now when that \u201ctitle field\u201d isn\u2019t shown anymore, it\u2019s weird. Something to ponder for future upgrades of Vanilla.</p>\n<p>Btw \u201cDave\u201d has Dave in his name.</p>\n<p>And I\u2019m Sandra in case that wasn\u2019t clear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>As far as I know, while both were from Infocom, the Spellcaster series wasn\u2019t part of the Great Underground universe that was Zork (which was itself based on public domain games like Dungeon and Collossal Cave).</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are some crossovers in Enchanter but maybe it\u2019s not full-on same continuity. Thanks for the clarification.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>It seems to me that Rails really needs clarification down to its basics (like Spike does) [\u2026] It\u2019s all about being a strong storyteller/plotter and deciding on story elements based on that sense of structure \u2013 opposed to Impro, which more embodies AW\u2019s central concept of \u201cKeep it feral\u201d and never letting anyone decide where the story is going to go in advance.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Railgnusto in the <a href="http://idiomdrottning.org/riss/" rel="nofollow">RISS</a> sense is about pre-writing things that will happen in the game. Gnusto is the spell of \u201cwriting\u201d in Enchanter.</p>\n<p>So if you use your sense of structure in an ad-hoc way, that\u2019s not Railgnusto necessarily. It becomes Railgnusto if you think ahead. \u201cFirst they\u2019ll this, then they\u2019ll that, then they\u2019ll this\u201d (and I consider thinking of it in your own head without putting it to paper \u201cwriting\u201d in this sense).</p>\n<p>If you go \u201cOh, wouldn\u2019t it be cool and campbellian/chekovian if right now, [event] happened?\u201d that can still fall under Impronitfol. As long as you go one element at a time.</p>\n<p>I guess other names for the four corners could be:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Sequencing</dt>\n<dd>for Railgnusto; pre-planning a sequence of events, whether for your own character (\u201cI\u2019ll take a pact when I get to level 4 so I get more slots for my paladin\u2019s smiting\u201d) or for the group (\u201cAfter they defeat the boss, the hench will turn out to be the real boss\u201d)<br/></dd>\n<dt>Swerving</dt>\n<dd>for Impronitfol. You\u2019re adding elements based on the other\u2019s contributions to make a platform and you\u2019re tilting that platform.<br/></dd>\n<dt>Consequence-engine</dt>\n<dd>for Sandboxblorb. You want to set up a <em>system</em>, not only a rules system but the dungeon (or city, or relationship tangle) itself as a living system, that people can engage with and consequences <em>happen</em> from that system rather than from someone introducing element after-the-fact.<br/></dd>\n<dt>Fairness</dt>\n<dd>For Skillfrotz. It\u2019s all about finding something that works as a game-game. In some European languages, \u201cgame\u201d is two separatewords. One for the type of make-pretend games kids do like \u201cLet\u2019s pretend that we\u2019re animals\u201d and one for \u201cbalanced\u201d, designed games like chess, Civilization, Magic the Gathering etc.<br/></dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21069/riss-official-canonical-theory/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21069/riss-official-canonical-theory">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21069/riss-official-canonical-theory/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21069/riss-official-canonical-theory/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21069%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21069%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
