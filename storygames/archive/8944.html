Its neat because it satisfies that strange craving for *stuff* that motivates my vague interest in traditional rpgs, but that *stuff* is largely neat *stuff* that is burrowed from TROS &amp; Sorcerer. Neat! I also found character creation to be a real hoot, even if it wasn't as high-concept as a lot of indie rpgs at the time.<br/><br/>The setting was generic dark fantasyland(yawn) but in eastern/northen europe I think(Maybe not yawn?). I didn't have a clue how to make a conspiracy really interesting while reading it, I think most of the advice in the book was about how not to be a cockblocking asshole. I played in two campaigns of it, both of which had solid starts and self-destructed because of other players happening to wig out at the time. Maybe its hella cursed.<br/><br/>The second book sounded like it had more hippy dippie mechanics that sounded interesting, but I also heard it lost some of its 'spark', whatever that means. I'd invite elaborations on that by anybody who expressed such.<br/><br/>So what was your CoS buisness like?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197562/#Comment_197562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T08:59:24+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  8:59AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a bit tangenital, but Keith had made a <a href="http://www.conspiracyofshadows.com/dirtyhands/node/1" rel="nofollow">revision</a> of the game.

There are problems with both books, which is why I transitioned to a free, <a href="http://www.conspiracyofshadows.com" rel="nofollow">web-based platform</a> for the game. Lets me tinker until I get it right (like the conflict resolution, I am still not entirely happy with it).<br/><br/>In my own experience running the thing, I found that the conspiracy creation in the first book was very much like you said, how not to be a dick. The second one got a little two high concept without any meat, and the third version I think I finally got the right balance.<br/><br/>Keith                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198213/#Comment_198213" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-22T04:03:31+00:00" title="March 22, 2009  4:03AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2009 4:04AM by Sean Musgrave.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, everytime I peek through an edition of this game I get itching to run it, despite next to no interest in the 'setting' (No offense, you have to be some kind of wild-eyed crazy man like Judd to get me pumped about a setting, ala Dictionary of Mu.) I love horror-adventure-fantasy, and I love how so much of the text is dripping with situation.<br/><br/>Hey Judd,<br/><br/>What parts of the book turned out to be useful? What parts of the book turned out to be crap, for your purposes?<br/><br/>Hey Keith,<br/><br/>Why aren't you happy with the conflict resolution? Maybe I can help you with my charming naivate.<br/><br/>Also, the rules for how to run sessions etc look neat in this edition.

I have this obsession with it. I have notebooks of notes, and dynastic family trees, and illustrations on the shit (all of which are contributing to my art-hause type project for it).<br/><br/>I guess I am unhappy with how it is set up to handle set-up to conflicts (I call it unopposed conflicts). I would also love to figure out a way to add the endurance portion of the first edition conflict rules, but I don't know if they are really needed. I just like the idea of limited resources forcing tactical choices. I've been toying with the idea of some sort of ticker to reflect that (like say 6 chips at the start of a conflict, with chips representing a purchase of an action type, with a refresh rate of one per Exchange, and maybe some non-action stuff to gain more).<br/><br/>The rules to run the sessions were tested pretty well by my internal group, but no external testing (which is where real testing comes from). I am confident that they work pretty much as intended, but until I get some more feedback I really won't know for sure.<br/><br/>If you get a hankering to give it a go and send me a report or post some shit online and let me know, I'll send you and your group some free shit (art prints and comics). I got boxes of the crap lying around since I stopped selling shit and went all socialist with my work.<br/><br/>Keith                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
