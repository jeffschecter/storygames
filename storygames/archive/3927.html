We're 10-weeks into the very very very complex story.<br/><br/>I couldn't even begin to explain it all.<br/><br/>I have no idea how long it's going to go, but I have enough material for 30 additional weeks, easily.<br/><br/>Anyway.<br/><br/>There are three players. Two have made slightly evil, very selfish characters. Perfect for a city adventure with no plot, but lots of goals. The third player made a character that doesn't "mesh" perfectly, but for 10 weeks we made it work.<br/><br/>At the 10-week mark major things started to happen in the city. An inner secret society started to die off from mysterious circumstances, and the players found themselves in a precarious situation where their own power could be used to exploit the "enemy." <br/><br/>In the end, all of them failed to get themselves into positions of power, although narrow windows were open for this.<br/><br/>And an interesting revelation about roleplaying games struck me. And maybe someone can phrase this for me, that's also encountered the same phenomenon.<br/><br/>But when you're playing in something long-term, so long as a character doesn't die, success and failure are the same thing. The only difference is your emotional response to the events as they transpire.<br/><br/>Dogs, of course, has this built into the game.<br/><br/>I have more ideas, but I await your responses.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88054/#Comment_88054" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T13:33:01+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  1:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel has a great spiel on this.  In this game, Success and Failure are two directions to a game.  No matter what outcome, the game should continue to move and be interesting.  Making a failure a dead end is really boring, and creates a lot of frustration for the players involved. <br/><br/>However, if failures cause interesting complications, then the players are still engaged, and things keep moving.  <br/><br/>I remember a specific circumstance in my Burning Wheel game, set in the new Blossoms are Falling setting book.  A player wants to make a hunting skill roll to find some game.  She fails.  Saying "You find nothing" is boring and worthless, the act of rolling the dice is a very clear indication from the player that they want something to happen.  So instead, I had a rather mean Fox gnawing on a trap line, trying to steal a rabbit from the snare.  That fox snarls and tries to snap at her.  Complication!  The story keeps moving! <br/><br/>It has led to failures being viewed with eagerness, rather than frustration. I even encourage players to suggest some fun complications to put their characters in!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88058/#Comment_88058" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T13:41:49+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  1:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

One of the reason's my COIL story is so complex is because I track everything the PCs do, so as the story progresses more and more people become aware of what's at stake and more people want to exploit that.<br/><br/>Although now that we're entering a new phase of the game, I have to push the clock forward a few months, because of the fear of dead-ending... which can be an inevitability in a game where the GM is the ultimate arbiter of all cause and effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88063/#Comment_88063" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T14:25:09+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  2:25PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Word.

For example, in Burning Wheel it very much states, within the body of the rules, in a variety of ways, that failure should progress the story in dynamic ways.

The scene ends none of the players are really effected by the "speed bumb" of the scene. The inverse is also true. The player fails, and marks off six hit points on his character sheet and moves on.<br/><br/>Obviously intelligent players can track their own successes and failures and don't need a system for it, but experience has taught me that most people want less paperwork. Not more.<br/><br/>As Josh has stated, in <i>FLFS,</i> the game monitors failure. But that work is left to the GM who is still required to monitor failure and the long term implications of said failure... especially if he wants it to matter in the story. For example, a player tries to get a radio to work, but instead turns it into a transmitter, thus letting the bad guys know his location. But the bad guys probably shouldn't show up for about 5 scenes, right? In the meantime, the PCs continue to fail and succeed, here and there, each time requiring the GM to track yet another THREAD in the overall story.<br/><br/>Which can add up to a lot of (rewarding) work.<br/><br/>I don't have all the answers yet, but there should be a way to track all of this without taxing a single player and still making it fun and complicated for the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88123/#Comment_88123" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T23:42:21+00:00" title="August 14, 2007 11:42PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>But the bad guys probably shouldn't show up for about 5 scenes, right?</blockquote>\nWere I running it, the bad guys would show up nigh-immediately. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88124/#Comment_88124" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T23:56:36+00:00" title="August 14, 2007 11:56PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks because you're a jerk!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88127/#Comment_88127" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T00:09:57+00:00" title="August 15, 2007 12:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nigh-immediately is too slow!

The plot of the game advances, but in such a way to cause conflict or problems for the characters involved.  Here's an example from one of my sessions.<br/><br/>It's a Burning Empires game, and there's a failed roll on a test to transmit an encoded message.  There's a few ways this failure could go.  I could say "It doesn't get transmitted".  The game slams to a halt.  Nothing else happens.  And that's not going to be fun.  I could say "It transmits, but is discovered by the enemy".  I could say "The nearby enemy forces are jamming the signal." Now there's some fun consequences!  The "yes, but" and "no, and" failures are solid gold in this regard.  <br/><br/>In a game, the only logical consequence is to maximize the fun in session.  And blocking statements of "You find nothing", or "Nothing happens" or "it doesn't work" are not a fun maximizer.  <br/><br/>Blocking statements are the opposite of fun.  They're very frustrating because there is literally no follow up.  In some games you could just test again, and again, and again, until you eventually win or die inside.  But this means failure has no other consequence other than having to bounce dice uselessly over and over again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88271/#Comment_88271" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T22:20:21+00:00" title="August 15, 2007 10:20PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again I say, if failure has no other consequence but rolling dice you should not be rolling dice.

That might be a good thing, if those new avenues opening every time someone searches a bathroom are fun, but it could also be extremely distracting and disjointed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>If failure means nothing more than "you don't find anything" I wonder why you're rolling dice in the first place.

If they roll, they don't know if they rolled high enough or if there just isn't something there. If every search situation with nothing to be found is answered with a straight "you find nothing, no need to roll" then immersion can be damaged. When you know that there is nothing to be found until a die drops, you know you haven't missed anything.\n<blockquote>I agree that is what Jim seems to be going for, at least in the OP.

You can instead have them roll once to find traps and never roll again until the situation changes. You could play a system with some sort of diceless variant on "taking ten/twenty" where the player chooses not to roll dice in exchange for getting the average result every time, or taking much longer to do the best job they possibly can.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Again I say, if failure has no other consequence but rolling dice you should not be rolling dice. Could you imagine a book where they went to send out a signal and failed and it had no real impact on the narrative? I'd wonder why the author was wasting my time.</blockquote>\nRPGs aren't books. They use other methods to establish suspence. RPGs can use most of those methods, but they also have the added benefit of die rolls as a possible source of suspence. I'm not saying that every time someone opens a closet you make them roll, but if you don't make them roll sometimes when the only possible result is "nothing happens" then you've given up an opportunity to generate suspence. <br/><br/>"Nothing happens" is a truism in the GM's eyes, but a wellspring of possibilities in the player's. While the GM knows that nothing really happened, the player only knows that he made a die roll. I've used player speculation on what "nothing" really meant to springboard new campaign arcs and tell me which directions they were expecting things to go.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>This is what's caused people to embrace "freeform" and "fudging" for the "sake of the story" to begin with.

If you're relying on someone to (for example) find the revolver under the butler's pillow, then you either have to lead the players there by the nose or risk an evening of boredom as players search everything but the butler's room. <br/><br/>If you're playing a prestructured game (even partially) you should allow for multiple paths to the finish line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88366/#Comment_88366" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T10:14:49+00:00" title="August 16, 2007 10:14AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, James.<br/><br/>Firstly, can you tell me if you've played any 'indie games' or 'story-games?'  If so, what was your experience like?<br/><br/>Secondly, I can tell you right now that you're approaching this scenario in a manifestly different way than most of the other folks in the thread; that's what's leading to the confusion.  It's like you're on one side of the elephant, and you're all, "It has a trunk and big flappy ears" and we're on the other side, and we're all, "It's got big, thick legs, and a little tiny tail and <em>oh my god what was that?</em>"  So our experiences differ.<br/><br/>Specifically, and to get a little jargonny, you're approaching this by looking only at Task Resolution, and assuming that Conflict Resolution is the purview of GM Fiat (or GM Discretion).  That is, you're assuming that players roll dice to see if they succeed at tasks, and the GM decides if the lumped-together successes and failures mean that the players get what they want or not.  While that is a functional way of playing, it does have some drawbacks -- among them, the players expending a lot of effort on tasks that aren't going to get them anything, win or lose: like searching the cupboards when the GM has the clue hidden upstairs.  This structure can (but doesn't have to) descend into a guessing game of "figure out the right solution" and then rolling dice to see if you could actually perform the solution... and often, the die roll becomes a formality and the real game is guessing the right solution.  In such a situation, yeah, if you try the "wrong" solution, then you get a 'you get nothing' response, especially when you fail.  Now, I don't want to give the impression that I'm demeaning that playstyle at all; it can be hella fun.  It's all puzzly-figure-things-out sorta play.<br/><br/>If you flip assumptions around, however, you get a very different play experience.  Consider an explicit Conflict Resolution with outcomes controlled by the players and mediated by Task Resolution dice mechanics.  That is, the players identify up front <em>what they want</em> and then they do a number of specific tasks that would forward that goal.  The GM has NPCs and environmental effects that get in the way of those tasks.  If the players' tasks overwhelm the GM's opposition, the players get what they want.  There is no 'correct solution' to find; instead, if the players win the conflict, whatever they did turns out to be the correct solution.  Either the PCs find the clue in the cupboards they were searching, or their searching the cupboards tips them off to the clue upstairs.  This results in a very different, much more collaborative experience, and this structure can (but doesn't have to) pull players out of immersion since they're manipulating the story directly rather than manipulating it indirectly through blindered character action.<br/><br/>Now, once you start using that explicit Conflict Resolution, it's a simple thing for the players to identify what they get if they win up front and the GM to propose what will happen if they lose.  Then all those individual tasks can bounce between forwarding their goal and preventing the GM's goal.  And that's all sorts of fun.

Explicit statements of intent are neccessary when it becomes apparent that the players are misunderstanding each others' intentions.   However, I think that in any other case, they are real dampeners on the moment.  Because, like in improv games, much of my rpg enjoyment comes from trying to figure out what another player is up to.  Sometimes, explicit statments of intent can ruin a moment.  <br/><br/>It's analagous to the difference between cracking a joke (entertaining), and explaining a joke (banal).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88456/#Comment_88456" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T17:45:05+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  5:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>it's blatantly obvious that they want him to ally with her?</blockquote>\nThe point is that it's not necessarily that obvious.<br/><br/>What if the players really want to take over the kingdom and are using the gnolls as a threat?<br/>What if they want to defeat the evil goblin horde and an alliance between the king and the gnolls is just one way to do that?<br/>What if they just want to get a big bunch of cash and this alliance thing is a scam to get a reward?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88459/#Comment_88459" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T18:11:07+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  6:11PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>How so?

Misreading each other at the gaming table can cause a lot of frustration.  I like having a constant level of chatter regarding what's happening in the session, where the players want to go, reasonings behind their character's actions, suggestions on what to do next, suggestions on courses of action, reminders of things other players might have forgot.  All that chatter is good stuff, it keeps other players involved in scenes their character's aren't part of, and it keeps everyone tied into the events happening in game.  <br/><br/>And if you have this kind of chatter, you can get to fun stuff like the actual intent of the player.  If a player is getting his character to search a bathroom, you can then ask the player why he's searching, or what he's searching for.  The player could say "my character Steve just has a thing for bathrooms" then you don't roll, just let him go nuts.  Or he could say "I'm looking for something I can use to Blackmail the duke", and then you roll, and failure means that he found the blackmail, but there's a knock on the door and angry voices.  Or the maid walks in on him in the midst of his ransacking.  Or a pipe is loosened and sprays him with water, soaking his suit.  How does he explain this to the party below?  <br/><br/>Making failure about nothing happening makes the die roll lack teeth.  If failing creates consequences, then the story continues, as the player then enjoys a chance to scramble with stopping the spraying pipe, or charms the maid, or shoots his way past the angry voices.  If he fails those rolls, there's more consequences.  The maid screams bloody murder, the spraying pipe creates a small river of water out into the hallway, attracting the attention of curious guests, the angry men capture the hero.  Each failure moves things forward.  <br/><br/>I also always have the other players, including the one that failed, chime in with ideas on what happens when a failure occurs.  Many heads are better than one. I've had a a whole evening of gaming greeted with laughter, gasps, groans and silent tension as the players have a string of bad luck on the dice.

I understand English pretty well and they don't speak any foreign languages. If they're looking to take over the kingdom, defeat the goblin horde, or scam the king I'll know about it.

James you really breathed a lot of life into it with your fresh / alternate viewpoint.<br/><br/>Another thing explicitly stating the intent of your roll can do, is really make the player himself understand why he's doing stuff. Sometimes as a player you might just go search the bathroom without really thinking about why -- just a vague idea there might be something interesting there. Having to state intent spurs your creativity, forces you to focus your vague ideas into a solid purpose. Which then spurs the GM's creativity -- and everyone else's too!<br/><br/>GM: "Back to Jon, where did we leave Sir William? Oh yeah, the bathroom. It's a very fancy bathroom."<br/>Player1: "I'm going to roll Search [picks up dice]..."<br/>GM: "Wait, what are you looking for and why?"<br/>Player1: "Oh ... uh ... I wanted to find some information on the Duke."<br/>GM: "What for?"<br/>Player2: "Hey maybe something we can blackmail him with!"<br/>Player1: "Yeah!"<br/>GM: "Okay cool! But if you fail, it'll be obvious to everyone at the party that you were nosing around."<br/><br/>Also, explicitly stating intent can really help to reduce those sessions where you just have an 'off' night, where you might not be reading the other people as well, or whatever. The group I play with usually plays "story" games, but for a while we tried Wild Talents (still kind of indie but definitely a more traditional, task-based resolution game). We had an absolute blast playing that game! We were firing on all cylinders and things were going great ... but then suddenly we had a VERY BAD session that basically ended the campaign. Deprotagonization, poor use of GM Fiat, boring failures, all the monsters came out of the closet. In hindsight (I was GM) it was all rooted in the task resolution: I firmly believe that explicitly stated intents and interesting failure complications could have saved that game. But I'm glad it happened, it was an awesome learning experience.<br/><br/>All that said, I can see why James doesn't see much use for these techniques -- having a group that knows each other well and has played together for a long time can really help you past a lot of these hurdles. When I played D&amp;D with my two brothers we just all operated on the same wavelength, and the games were always fun. Yet even then there was a certain degree of GM burnout, and Dave (the DM) was always hoping for more player authorship in the game. If we ever manage to get together and pick up that campaign again, we'll use Burning Wheel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88483/#Comment_88483" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T22:04:05+00:00" title="August 16, 2007 10:04PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2007 10:04PM by Jon Slack.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite><br/>I'm sitting at the table with these guys as they discuss their plans.

I really do. I've played that game. Heck, I've run that game. I don't want to play that game any more. Wondering whether I made a superfluous roll or failed a critical roll does not, except in very rare instances, provide me with suspense. More like, annoyance. I would venture to say that your games would still rock without that particular suspense. <br/><br/>I look at it this way. If it doesn't come out at the table, it never existed as far as I'm concerned. Anything you as GM create that the players don't experience in some way is irrelevant to the players. Now, I am playing to have great, exciting, emotional experiences. You as the GM are (I assume) creating a world for me to have those fantastic experiences in. There's no conflict between what the player and the GM want in this situation. Why are we rolling dice?  If you create a world with 10 cool things and I find 5 of them, I missed out on half the cool. Now, if I had to make 100 superfluous rolls in order to be sure I was not overlooking some hidden coolness, I'm far from riveted at the edge of my seat with suspense. <br/><br/>If I search a closet and there's nothing in it, how is my forever wondering if I missed an important clue back at that closet adding to your story?  The character found nothing and acts on that information unless further evidence contradicts. The player is wondering whether it was just a failed skill test. What do I do with that? Search again? I'm bored just thinking about it. Either there is something in the closet that is important to the story, or there is not. If there is and I fail my skill roll, that's cool. Now its the story of my failure to find the hidden something, or my finding the hidden something but not realizing its importance, or getting discovered while finding the hidden something. What it is not, is the story of my uncertainty of whether I checked stuff good. <br/><br/>Again, I'm sure your games rock. But as an example, lets imagine a game where everything that was awesome about the story was behind some skill test. And lets say I failed every important skill test. And lets assume that because I don't know whether or not I should make a skill test in a particular situation, I made many many superfluous skill tests. That game would suck! You would never create a game in which the players had a % chance of that level of extreme suckitude. My question is why have that potential there even in minute doses?<br/><br/>Okay, so what do we have instead? There are some radical, hippie game answers. Some games allow the players some authorship. Maybe I spend a fate point to declare that there's something in the closet. Or maybe we have a conflict between player and GM about whether there is something important in the closet or not. Yes, those answers take some of the control out of the GMs hands which can be scary.<br/><br/>Another answer falls under "Say yes or roll dice!" Meaning give the players everything until you get to actual, meaningful conflict that drives story. So, if they search the closet and something's there, give it to them. If they question a witness who knows a clue, make sure they have every opportunity to get that knowledge. If there's a story you want them to be part of, tell it. Sooner or later you will come to a point where there is real conflict. Where you as GM are not sitting there thinking "I hope they make this roll so they can find the hidden treasure."  A point where there is a choice between different kinds of cool stories. Where the potential for failure and loss has dramatic impact. At that point bring out the dice and play hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88504/#Comment_88504" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T00:27:59+00:00" title="August 17, 2007 12:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2007 12:31AM by noclue.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Found this cool article on PC failure <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/65/learn-to-explain-failure/" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/><br/>An excerpt:\n<blockquote>Failure should be big.

I play with a long-term group (some of us have been gaming together for 20 years and more), and we have very good communications. Some of the players are immersivist enough that a formal stakes-setting system is often not an option. We do experience occasional problems with intent, usually in situations where a conversation is being played out in real time. When I GM, I point out to the players that if they want social mechanics to help them achieve something, they have to tell me what it is they are trying to achieve, but still things do sometimes go wrong.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's often not fully acknowledged/appreciated by those who love stakes setting that it does come at a price, and will suit some games better than others. If you're OK with paying that price, there's a lot to be gained, but it *is* a trade-off.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to speak up in favour of fudging. In many game systems, there are effectively two parallel systems in operation. The first is that things are simply adjudicated, whether by the GM or (less commonly) by a majority of players, or whatever. Someone just pulls "what happens next" out of the air, either because it's obvious, or it's thematic, or it's somehow necessary. Then there is a second system, with dice/cards/etc., some mechanical rules, etc. Often this is used on occasions when system 1 seems too difficult or controversial to use. <br/><br/>On this basis, "fudging" is simply the recognition, partway through using system 2 to resolve a situation, that the mechanics are not well matched to the situation, and are at risk of generating unsuitable results. To bail out and revert to system 1 is an entirely logical and reasonable solution, so long as everyone is on the same page about it. What's not a good idea is to pretend to do one thing while really doing another, unless people have indicated that they really want to be deceived in that way.<br/><br/>It is of course possible to design systems where only one system is in use for the entire game, no matter what happens, and most posters to this forum will be familiar with them. Just like stake setting (which they often use) however, there is a trade-off to be made in using such a system. For example, the use of in-game factors (e.g. how heavy the rock is) rather than meta-game factors (e.g. what resources the player is willing to expend)  to determine outcomes generally goes out the window in such a universal system. For some, that's a great bargain. For others, not so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88556/#Comment_88556" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T07:47:07+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  7:47AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>On this basis, "fudging" is simply the recognition, partway through using system 2 to resolve a situation, that the mechanics are not well matched to the situation,</blockquote>\nTo me, that 'recognition' is a damning critique of the game design.

To use the earlier example, the players have discussed what it is they want to do and then a scene or two later the guy searching taking a dump says "what the heck, I'll poke around in the bathroom a bit." You already know they want to know more about the duke, wouldn't mind getting some cash, and seemed interested in finding the duchess's brooch because they believe it was stolen.

I can dig it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>I look at it this way. If it doesn't come out at the table, it never existed as far as I'm concerned. Anything you as <br/><br/>GM create that the players don't experience in some way is irrelevant to the players. Now, I am playing to have great, <br/><br/>exciting, emotional experiences. You as the GM are (I assume) creating a world for me to have those fantastic <br/><br/>experiences in. There's no conflict between what the player and the GM want in this situation. Why are we rolling dice? <br/><br/>If you create a world with 10 cool things and I find 5 of them, I missed out on half the cool. Now, if I had to make <br/><br/>100 superfluous rolls in order to be sure I was not overlooking some hidden coolness, I'm far from riveted at the edge <br/><br/>of my seat with suspense.</blockquote>\nUnless it's a very simple system, 100 superfluous rolls is definitely way too many. Even if it is a simple system that's probably too much. I'm talking about four or five. Just enough so that everything's importance to the campaign isn't iron clad, locked in place by the fact that you made a roll when you got close to it.\n<blockquote>If I search a closet and there's nothing in it, how is my forever wondering if I missed an important clue back at that <br/><br/>closet adding to your story? The character found nothing and acts on that information unless further evidence <br/><br/>contradicts. The player is wondering whether it was just a failed skill test. What do I do with that? Search again? I'm <br/><br/>bored just thinking about it. Either there is something in the closet that is important to the story, or there is not. <br/><br/>If there is and I fail my skill roll, that's cool. Now its the story of my failure to find the hidden something, or my <br/><br/>finding the hidden something but not realizing its importance, or getting discovered while finding the hidden <br/><br/>something. What it is not, is the story of my uncertainty of whether I checked stuff good.</blockquote>\nYour failure to find the hidden thing and your success at finding nothing are the exact same story when you don't have everything cemented in place by die rolls only occuring at critical junctures.\n<blockquote>Again, I'm sure your games rock. But as an example, lets imagine a game where everything that was awesome about the <br/><br/>story was behind some skill test. And lets say I failed every important skill test. And lets assume that because I <br/><br/>don't know whether or not I should make a skill test in a particular situation, I made many many superfluous skill <br/><br/>tests. That game would suck! You would never create a game in which the players had a % chance of that level of extreme <br/><br/>suckitude. My question is why have that potential there even in minute doses?</blockquote>\nYou're absolutely right, that game would suck, unless your failures snowballed into something exciting. I think you're misunderstanding my stance. I'm not saying the player should roll dice every time he looks in a closet, resulting in countless superfluous rolls. I'm saying he should roll dice whenever the GM tells him to, resulting in 4-5 superfluous rolls.\n<blockquote>Okay, so what do we have instead? There are some radical, hippie game answers. Some games allow the players some <br/><br/>authorship. Maybe I spend a fate point to declare that there's something in the closet. Or maybe we have a conflict <br/><br/>between player and GM about whether there is something important in the closet or not. Yes, those answers take some of <br/><br/>the control out of the GMs hands which can be scary.</blockquote>\nI'd love to play a game like that. But my group has a hard time creating minor scenery with people when they stunt in Exalted. I have no idea how they'd react to everyone at the table having the capability for a few short bursts of true GM power.\n<blockquote>Another answer falls under "Say yes or roll dice!" Meaning give the players everything until you get to actual, <br/><br/>meaningful conflict that drives story. So, if they search the closet and something's there, give it to them. If they <br/><br/>question a witness who knows a clue, make sure they have every opportunity to get that knowledge. If there's a story <br/><br/>you want them to be part of, tell it. Sooner or later you will come to a point where there is real conflict. Where you <br/><br/>as GM are not sitting there thinking "I hope they make this roll so they can find the hidden treasure." A point where <br/><br/>there is a choice between different kinds of cool stories. Where the potential for failure and loss has dramatic <br/><br/>impact. At that point bring out the dice and play hard.</blockquote>\nIMO a better idea is to not set up situations where you're sitting there hoping "I hope they make this roll."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88560/#Comment_88560" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T08:00:17+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  8:00AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>I disagree a little with several parts of this discussion. I play with <br/><br/>a long-term group (some of us have been gaming together for 20 years and more), and we have very good communications. <br/><br/>Some of the players are immersivist enough that a formal stakes-setting system is often not an option. We do experience <br/><br/>occasional problems with intent, usually in situations where a conversation is being played out in real time. When I <br/><br/>GM, I point out to the players that if they want social mechanics to help them achieve something, they have to tell me <br/><br/>what it is they are trying to achieve, but still things do sometimes go wrong.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's often not fully acknowledged/appreciated by those who love stakes setting that it does come at <br/><br/>a price, and will suit some games better than others. If you're OK with paying that price, there's a lot to be gained, <br/><br/>but it *is* a trade-off.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to speak up in favour of fudging. In many game systems, there are effectively two parallel <br/><br/>systems in operation. The first is that things are simply adjudicated, whether by the GM or (less commonly) by a <br/><br/>majority of players, or whatever. Someone just pulls "what happens next" out of the air, either because it's obvious, <br/><br/>or it's thematic, or it's somehow necessary. Then there is a second system, with dice/cards/etc., some mechanical <br/><br/>rules, etc. Often this is used on occasions when system 1 seems too difficult or controversial to use.<br/><br/>On this basis, "fudging" is simply the recognition, partway through using system 2 to resolve a situation, that the <br/><br/>mechanics are not well matched to the situation, and are at risk of generating unsuitable results. To bail out and <br/><br/>revert to system 1 is an entirely logical and reasonable solution, so long as everyone is on the same page about it. <br/><br/>What's not a good idea is to pretend to do one thing while really doing another, unless people have indicated that they <br/><br/>really want to be deceived in that way.<br/><br/>It is of course possible to design systems where only one system is in use for the entire game, no matter what happens, <br/><br/>and most posters to this forum will be familiar with them. Just like stake setting (which they often use) however, <br/><br/>there is a trade-off to be made in using such a system. For example, the use of in-game factors (e.g. how heavy the <br/><br/>rock is) rather than meta-game factors (e.g. what resources the player is willing to expend) to determine outcomes <br/><br/>generally goes out the window in such a universal system. For some, that's a great bargain. For others, not so <br/><br/>much.</blockquote>\nI agree with you near completely.

"Hey look, this game led us here, and then abandoned us to our own devices.  Why did we buy this book?"<br/><br/>It's like if you bought a car and in the owner's manual it said, "You can totally jump off bridges into the river."  And then when you did, you found out that the car sinks.  That's poor design. Hi Joshua. That sounds to me like a system being oversold by its creator. Which is a valid complaint, but it can bite other kinds of systems too. <br/><br/>I don't think it's possible to make a system in which in-game factors are used to determine outcomes without having a degree of fiat, whether from the GM or someone else. And game designers should be up front about that. But unapologetic. Looked at from another perspective, that of the freeformer, fiat is in fact the ideal system. The "game design" you refer to is then just a necessary evil to be minimized as far as possible. YMMV.<br/><br/>Equally, you could argue that games where (satisfyingly from the designer's POV) the system can handle *any* situation come with clearer caveats about what you give up in order to get that satisfaction. Dogs is a great game, but it won't answer certain questions. Anyone hoping for a game in which skill with weapons or superior cover decides a gunfight is going to be disappointed. Sure, if my character is standing next to a water barrel, I can narrate that into my Raise, but it's just colour - the system won't assign it any weight. I'm cool with that.

You and your group decides to jump off a bridge into the river with it, because the hovercraft you usually drive can handle that just fine. Death and destruction ensues. When/if you survive, you bolt clumsy flotation devices onto it and jump off the next bridge, laugh and tell your passengers "Look, I fixed it!". A month later, the car crumbles from rust.<br/><br/>There was a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3631" rel="nofollow">recent discussion</a> regarding multiple protagonists participating in a conflict in Polaris. If there was a consensus that came out of that discussion at all, it was that while you can do this, it's not something the Polaris rules handle smoothly (with apologies to Ben). If you really want to make it work, you should be familiar enough with the rules and how they work in actual play to be able to get through such a scene, but it's not going to go down smoothly. It's not what the game is <b>about</b>.<br/><br/>A D&amp;D aficionado would look at such a rules system and call it "broken", because obviously brave knights need to be able to fight the demons as a team, not just as individuals. Yet this is a different story than the one Polaris is designed to tell. In fact, it may be a good thing that Polaris' rules aren't clear on this matter, just to discourage stories that divert from its focus.<br/><br/>On the other hand, D&amp;D offers little to no mechanical support for social interactions and conflicts other than those involving rallying henchmen and haggling with blacksmiths. You cannot criticize D&amp;D for this - that's a different story than the one D&amp;D intends to tell - but you <i>can</i> criticize D&amp;D related texts that claim that the rules are to be used to tell epic tales of bravery, intrigue and the clash of nations, yet do nothing to modify the base rules to support such tales. Bzzt, wrong story.<br/><br/>So, the games are different. They tell different stories. There is no system that can be used to tell any story proficiently - other than possibly PTA, and the jury is still out on that one.<br/><br/>So what I think you are saying, Dave, is that if you're encountering a situation the rules cannot handle proficiently, there are two options:<br/><br/>a) The game is broken, or<br/>b) You're trying to tell a different story than the one the game was written to support.<br/><br/>Example. My wife and I were playing Spacemaster (Rolemaster space setting) with a really hardcore DM. My wife played a kickass gun-toting beefy Amazon type girl, 80+ hit points. I played a scrawny unibomber-inspired ship engineer, 9 hit points. We get into a firefight with some police officers, nothing we shouldn't have been able to handle. One of the police officers roll a critical. Out come the crit chart. d100 scores 69. Turns out 69 on the firearms crit chart means "Bullet penetrates your skull into your brain, instant death". The Amazon woman dies in her first combat, while the rest of us make it out without a scratch.<br/><br/>Sucks? Yeah, it sucks. That's because the system, frankly, sucked. The system simulated life in space, with all the dreadful boredom that entailed, and we were trying to use it to tell a story of high action-packed adventure. If that roll had been fudged, we may still be bored to this day.<br/><br/>Example. In our most recent All Flesh Must Be Eaten game, one of the players wanted to shoot a zombie 3 feet away in the head at point blank range. The AFMBE rules state that aiming for the head means a -4 modifier. Point Blank Range only changes that to a -3, although it increases the damage multiplier as well. She could have received bonuses to hit by declaring she was aiming and taken her shot at the end of the turn, but that would have given the zombie a chance to attack first. So she held up her hand in a faux handgun pose to some other player's head, saying "How hard would it really be for me to hit at this range?", expressly suggesting that the ZM make an exception because - as is stated in AFMBE - the rules are but a guideline and that rule is "broken".<br/><br/>Disregarding the fact that AFMBE reinforces the IMHO broken model of "moving statues" combat, possibly making the player believe that her shot was being fired at a perfectly still zombie head only 3 feet away and that she was cool as a cucumber at the time, the main issue here is that the player is trying to apply real-world logic to a game that is about the living dead. AFMBE favours stories about people being badly hurt for no good reason, where you accidentally shoot your friend in the leg, where things explode when you shoot them. In such a game, it makes little sense to include a rule that ensures that you automatically score brains as long as you wait until your opponent is close enough.<br/><br/>Another indication is that for that player to be truly happy, she should probably play GURPS (which, incidentally, is her favourite).<br/><br/>Yes, a minimalistic or even freeform task-based resolution system with fudging whenever necessary will work great as a system for close-knit friends who want to tell the exact same type of story. Problem is, for every other situation it'll suck. And even close-knit friends might want to try out a more defined and focused system to experience a different type of story they may not have been able to easily come about without that guidance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88610/#Comment_88610" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T14:02:48+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  2:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>Dogs is a great game, but it won't answer certain questions.

It's a bit like buying a car that can allegedly cope with any terrain, but then you find that it does this by flying about 1000 ft off the ground. It's true you can get to any place you want, but the driving experience isn't quite what you expected. Some people then decide that although their old jeep was unreliable, prone to stalling, and sometimes you simply had to get out and push, nonetheless there was something about the experience that no flying car can reproduce. Others just love their new flying car.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88623/#Comment_88623" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T15:11:27+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  3:11PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2007 3:29PM by jzn.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jon Slack</cite>guesswork, psychology, and reading faces and looking for meaning behind words.</blockquote>\nYes!  Those things can be a game element.  They are elements of the game that interested audience members play, every time they watch a movie or read a novel.  What are this character's intentions?  What did he mean by what he said and did?  When you read the cliffnotes of a story, your mind is not faced with these kinds of questions.  Everything is layed out very neatly.  But reading cliffnotes isn't very entertaining.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you are <i>writing </i>a story, you certainly do want an omniscient view of every character's intentions. <br/><br/>In an RPG, since you are both the author and the audience, your stance on explicit statements of intent might come down to whether you more identify with the writing aspect, or the watching aspect.

I think it applies to many (not all) story games.<br/><br/>With one exception - I have not seen a single so-called story game that claims as one of its selling points that "it can cope with any terrain".

If D&amp;D had stated that up front, I would have enjoyed it much more than I did.<br/><br/>I agree, though, that occasionally the "view from a 1000ft in the air" is not all it's made out to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88636/#Comment_88636" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T15:59:38+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  3:59PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>With one exception - I have not seen a single so-called story game that claims as one of its selling points that "it can cope with any terrain".
