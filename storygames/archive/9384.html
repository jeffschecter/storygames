I make a new setting for each campaign, or make an old setting anew. The <i>system </i>of the game is light, in comparison to standard classical games like GURPS, D&amp;D and Warhammer, but the <i>method </i>is a bit broader than in most classical games (me having lots of tricks to play with, influencing the players, feeding elements to the game, etc.).<br/><br/>As said; all elements of the game are simple, to facilitate dynamic interaction with them. There is a balance to each and every element you purport to use in a game;<br/>- it need the right details to feed the game properly<br/>- and it has to be simple enough to be used with ease<br/><br/>The last point is easy to maintain in a system-light game like <i>Fabula</i>, but harder to achieve in "heavy" games like <i>Warhammer </i>and the like.<br/><br/>When starting a campaign I let the players choose between settings, or I give them one setting to make characters in. In either case they are given a very broad outline of the setting, which is built upon under character-creation (me giving their choices a cultural context).<br/><br/><b>A typical setting-presentation</b><br/>I place a well-drawn map before the players, depicting the lands we are to play in. I let them study it a bit, and then I start giving setting info: <br/><br/><i>This is <b>The Lands of the Holy Hand</b>; dominated by <b>The Church of the Holy Hand</b>. His Holyness the Pope, in the holy city of <b>Aroma</b> (pointing on the map), has forbidden any dealings with the dark forces of demons, so magic is non-existent. No character will be a witch, naturally.<br/><br/>You will start out in the land of <b>Marmadura</b> (indicating the area on the map), living as ordinary people in the southern dukedom of <b>Antilucia</b> (pointing on map). There are feudal lords on the top, living in overwhelming luxury, and farmers on the bottom, living in squalor.<br/><br/>Please choose your characters wisely; there will be no niceties coming the way of the farmhand in this game.</i><br/><br/>--- This is given in a "sprinkling" dialogue while the players start thinking about what kind of characters they want to play, and during character-creation. The setting info is kept light and sketchy, but meaningful. The point is to inform the players from the start what kind of conflicts and cultural landscape they will be playing in, and that is best done with such tidbits of info. The church and the feudal lords are easy to flesh out as the characters meet them. Then the powers that be may provoke the characters by wielding their authority, being arrogant and full of prejudice towards the "dirty and dumb and demon-ridden peasants".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_208067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208067/#Comment_208067" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T00:56:01+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 12:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 1:03AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I misrepresented my elements in the former post, giving them more details than I ordinarily do, so here is ...<br/><br/><b>A rewrite of the example elements:</b><br/><br/><i>Central NPC; <b>Baron Ottoz Bullbang</b><br/>- brute, master swordsman, want tough men</i><br/><i><br/>Father of character; <b>Jonath</b>, wise<br/><br/>Father of character; <b>Messer</b><br/><br/>Mother of character; <b>Omanoo</b>, buscom<br/><br/>Little brother; <b>Muix</b><br/><br/>Social contact: <b>Trader Jons</b><br/>- good at woodwork</i><br/><br/><b>The name</b> is the one detail I always includes.

I mostly play my own games, and make up stuff, as you do, on the fly, improvising from simple elements and going in depth during play. GM'ing <b>3:16</b> this winter, I have seen that game to support my kind of play very nicely; being that it is simple in setting and system, making it easy to work with. GM'ing <b>Mouseguard </b>I have a different experience. The game is heavy with setting and system, so I have translated much more, drawn my own maps, and made a much greater effort getting the game "under my skin", so to say. And I have played it less. A paradox, actually. Makes me wonder if a lot of GMs are doing a lot of work in many games, and end up with little actual game-play ...<br/><br/>As a gamesmith I am aware that others are going to read my stuff, and have to make do with it in some way. I need to help them make the best out of it. My take on that is to make the stuff as simple and playable as possible, supporting the GMs in use of the simple elements, by giving them method-tools for achieving the depth of play I like to have in my own games. Those tools are all about playing up to players initiatives, giving consequences, going with the drama, creating tension, and being a cynical/compassionate judge of characters and players alike.<br/><br/>One way of making stuff playable is to present it in easy to handle format; one page max for any given setting-frame ( a city, a castle, a kingdom, whatever ...), clearly labeled and short setting info, and at most the name and three details for each NPC (including any skills).<br/><br/>I find it a challenge to write my classical modules in this format, but I believe it makes them a far better support for the free flow of high-quality interaction. I tend to shun the temptation to make my book into "the fiction", and try my best to write my stuff in support for the players creating <i>the real fiction</i> of my game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208101/#Comment_208101" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T08:28:08+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  8:28AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the input guys, but I'm looking more for Actual Play stuff than generalized advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208109/#Comment_208109" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T09:36:13+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  9:36AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a several-session campaign of The Shadow of Yesterday that lasted for the better part of three months.  The game was set in Near and the group was highly invested in the fiction.  One factor in this was how easily-digistible the setting information was in the game book.  The post-disaster situation, the four lands, and the simple character stocks were easy to present to the players.  If they didn't have the book, it helped that the players could look over the setting information <a href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/" rel="nofollow">online</a>.<br/><br/>The characters were:<br/><br/>A reluctant hero from Maldor<br/>A Khale bard<br/>A Ratkin martial artist<br/>A Zaru speaker of Zu<br/><br/>All the characters had aspects of player design.  The ratkin is a good example because the concept was a wandering martial artist searching for his lost master.  This is what interested the player and, with the way the The Shadow of Yesterday is structured, it was easy to assign Secrets and Keys that filled out this concept.  Along a similar line, we created a custom secret for the reluctant hero (the Secret of Dumb Luck) to really make him fit what the player wanted.<br/><br/>The overall campaign was very much defined by the players.  By the end of the first story arc, all the characters had taken the Key of the Mission to represent their commitment to their greater goal.  The resolution system made it easy to incorporate different character with separate areas of expertise.  The Keys and Secrets allowed for characters to be customized to the desires of the players.  Overall, the setting was very open to whatever the players wanted to pursue, but this openness was then reinforced by the game mechanics.  To these qualities I attribute the success of the game.  We definitely incorporated the setting, but never did we feel restricted by it.  We also felt that we could have kept going with the characters and the initial situation for a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208113/#Comment_208113" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T09:56:09+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  9:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I've played a couple of long term games (a year or more long) with what could be considered a light setting - depending on the trickiness of definition. <br/><br/>One of them was an Exalted game, in which we didn't play in Creation. Instead the group made up its own micro-setting (defined as an island cut off from the rest of the world, deep in the wyld) and played in it with only one or two inroads from the outside world. So, on one hand, we were playing Exalted - but on the other hand none of the setting as setting (rather than setting as rules, setting as splats) etc, was really part of the game. Everything that really mattered was something we made together. <br/><br/>If that fits your definition, I can talk more about how we did it and such. <br/><br/>Another one of them is a swashbuckling game that started out like 7th Sea, but without the real 7th Sea setting. We used some 7th Sea place names and such, but quickly verged more towards real places and names than the Thean fantasy ones. However, due to our preferences the game never became a real historical game either. Instead it kinda got mapped out as we went, like a late Renaissance version of what Howard did with early historical cultures to make Hyborea. (With less racism, generally.) <br/><br/>If that fits your definition, I can talk more about how we did it and such. <br/><br/>I've also played all kinds of modern and modern-magical games that went on for a year or so, some of which looked like Unknown Armies (an interesting use of setting, actually) or World of Darkness but that used none of the "cannon" material from either game. There was also a superhero universe that we made up from scratch and played through for a couple years. <br/><br/>So, any of that sound like it meets what you're looking for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208116/#Comment_208116" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T10:11:15+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 10:11AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Brand,<br/><br/>Did the players already know the canon for the games even though you divorced it from the canon?

Indeed, the basic campaign conceit was that the characters were looking for an artifact to restore the land.  This came about at character creation when one of my players said "My character wants to find an artifact to restore the land."  From there we created situation around his idea and how the other characters fit into it.  The player could also easily tie his character to what he wanted from the game (Key of the Mission), even if we had to do some hacking (the custom Key I mentioned previously).<br/><br/>I'll try to give another example.  To get their hands on this artifact (the Seed), the players had to enter the Green (imagine a mysterious subterranean world that connects all the forests) and bargain with King Khale for it.  Now, there's some mention in the book how the King likes to see performances of plays retelling Khale myth, so that was the offer I had him make the characters.  We framed the ensuing scene around the performance.  The players made up the whole story, the characters they were portraying in the performance, everything.  It was taken from two in-canon details (the storytelling culture of the Khale and the King's want to listen), but the characters in the tale and what played out were completely provided by my group.  But then, of course, that myth became a part of our greater setting.<br/><br/>I lost steam writing my first post, but the point I was trying to make was that somehow, in the text and structure of The Shadow of Yesterday, Clinton gave us just enough information to get going, but then everything we wanted to add to the setting still mattered.  The play the characters performed, while satisfying an in-game conceit, also allowed the bard to hit his Key of Renown.  We were constantly referencing the game's lists of names to denominate the NPCs that mattered in our game.  Even the way the scene structuring works let us define what was important and how to resolve it.  Please feel free to ask any other questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208145/#Comment_208145" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T11:49:36+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 11:49AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 11:53AM by Brand_Robins.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, <br/><br/>In the Exalted and 7th Sea examples folks had some idea about the game. Most of them hadn't read the books, but did know "what Exalted is like." <br/><br/>The Superhero game, otoh, wasn't set in any canon universe. It was "our four color modern day game." So there were heavy genre elements that we knew we'd be playing to (costumed super heroes doing good, etc) - but none of the characters were from pre-established canon or whatever. All we did with that game is set up a lose premise, some genre things we would and would not be doing, and then spent a moderate amount of time creating our fictional city where most of the action would be based (a couple hours out of the setup session), and created characters together -- including a nemesis or two. <br/><br/>After that it was really pretty easy to keep going. I'd make up new villains from time to time, have old ones come back, occasionally someone would introduce a new element to the game ("There is totally a Mutant Registration arm of the government!") - which the system we were using had methods to handle -- and we'd go from there. <br/><br/>Super heroes, being based on a serial medium in which its usually assumed that the world is much like our world, but with these high-flying underwear perverts running around, is pretty easy to run mid to long term with minimal setting. Most of the "setting" that we developed in game was really about character on character interaction, with the growing relationships between heroes and villains and the "important" normals. (Important didn't mean important to the world, it meant emotionally important to the characters. So street rats and shopkeepers and such were often the most important non-supers in the game.) <br/><br/>It once got described, in terms of art, as being pictures where there are these kinda kewl sketched out backgrounds of big buildings and bustling cities that were there mostly to be broken and not colored in, with these hyper detailed super colored freaks taking up 90% of the panel.

I didn't consistently or extensively use the planet creation rules, and eventually didn't even really follow Traveller chargen so there wasn't even that much influence of "setting as rules".<br/><br/>Most of the setting details were developed in play or with some prep between sessions by me (once they started traveling off my original map, I did a lot of mapping work out of session, but planet details were generally handled when we needed them).<br/><br/>There was a floating set of players, with one player always there (we never played without him as I recall), and another who was there most sessions. These two players were the only ones who were really invested in the campaign (though at least a few of the other players were invested in the game when they played - they just didn't get into the larger context). There were several sessions that played out more as brainstorm sessions with little mechanical resolution. Other times, there would be short bursts of brainstorming as we worked out the implications of various events. These two players definitely contributed significantly to the developing setting.<br/><br/>I think what was important to driving this play was that I didn't have a lot of notes, and often came up with wild ideas. These two players especially then fed of the wild ideas. I would also say that part of the development was driven by interpreting the results of the mechanics.<br/><br/>I also ran a couple sessions in the same universe with some people at college. They never took off as well, and it was definitely because we never got into the groove of player contribution to the setting.<br/><br/>I've had other setting light campaigns, but they've never had the same degree of player investment in the developing setting. I had a RuneQuest campaign that had similar player investment and contribution, but that was much more guided by published material (and one of the players was as much if not more of a Gloranthaphile than me), so that campaign is not relevant to this discussion (other than perhaps to suggest that the depth of provided setting may not be relevant to whether this kind of player contribution to setting occurs or not).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208263/#Comment_208263" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T03:39:44+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  3:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A TV show that plays like this (setting light, developed in play) would be Lost.

No one was concerned about the light setting, however, none of us had played the game before and we went into it knowing that it wasn't going to be the last thing we played together.

I had created a map of a small kingdom (the lower right one on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.therpgsite.com/showpost.php?p=160023&amp;postcount=75" rel="nofollow">this photo</a>), one page of background history/legend and one page of about ten or twelve town descriptions (two or three sentences each, touching only on the most visible or most widely known feature). That was all "required reading" that my players had to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had mentioned a vanished race (?) of sorcerer-kings that once ruled most of the world. One player wanted to play the last descendant of that race, and by telling me how he (and his immediate forebearers) survived he defined a great part of the setting backstory.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one wanted to play an elf or a dwarf. I had only sketchy thoughts on what role those races should play in the setting, how numerous they were, etc., but by their non-selection they got relegated to the sidelines (even though the most important myth of the setting's past involved an elven hero).<br/>\n<br/>\nSix months later a new player joined the group. He was a total Tolkien fan and wanted to play a Legolas-like elf. (He was a complete RPG newbie so we decided to cut him some slack.) He wrote up a four page long family history. Since nothing of that was in conflict with what has been established in the first six months of the campaign I accepted all of it, and thus he defined much of the elven culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting light campaigns can't stay setting light, especially when they are supposed to run a long time. Just as simgames wrote:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">After five years of incremental development to the setting, it's become very detailed and involving.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nBut even four years into the campaign that method of player input still worked. I remember that one player had to roll up a new character (after losing his first one) and he decided to play a dwarven mage. There have been numerous dwarven npc's so a lot of the dwarven way of life was defined at that point. Dwarven mages were clearly not part of this. But the player came up with this secret-dwarven-magician-guild-thing and we rolled with it. The setting, and our play, was richer for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pattern I saw was:<br/>\nUsually it was the character creation part where most of the player's "investment in the fiction" happened. And during those parts when the actual play touched on things the players had developed. Sometimes I would ask,"ok, the elves are 'yours', how did you envision this or that aspect?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see that with long running campaigns it can become more and more difficult for a player to add something really new (and non-trivial) to a setting. That's the death knell of the <i>Forgotten Realms</i> and<i> Das Schwarze Auge.</i><br/>\nI guess my subconscious way of dealing with that was to never define the borders of a setting. Always leave that "mysterious East" unspecified so that new players and characters can still create their personal investment/niche in the game - <i>if they want that.</i> (And not all of them did.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208308/#Comment_208308" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T10:35:09+00:00" title="May 20, 2009 10:35AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My answer just got fucking eaten.<br><br>Let's try this again.

We started about as setting-light as you could get; for the first session the players (and I, as GM) suggested 'steampunk', 'clockpunk', 'colonialism', 'stupidly-huge constructs', 'competing technologies' and 'Miyazaki anime' as tropes.<br/><br/>After five play-sessions and considerable collaboration, we have so much setting splat that we use a wiki to keep track of it.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <a href="http://steamworks.wikispaces.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://steamworks.wikispaces.com</a><br/><br/>Since the wiki is a session-chronology-plus-gazeteer, it doesn't show how all these details were accreted during play, and that seems to be part of Bankuei's original question.  So here goes (brace yourself, I'm a wordy bastard):  <br/><br/>We used the guidelines in Starblazer for setting creation.  I was teaching the rules to two of the players, so I created two example nations, gave them a couple paragraphs of description, gave them Aspects for each phase, and showed their interactions with each other.  Then everyone else created a nation, and their nations interacted with one anothers, or with mine.  During this, we brainstormed some of the competing technologies ideas we had.  We generally used the 'improv prime directive' of "Say yes..." or "Yes, and...", or "Yes, but..." but never outright saying "No." to anyone's contributions.<br/><br/>(This was <i>amazingly</i> cool for me as a GM.  I got all sorts of setting stuff, covered in plot-hooks.  The Glass Islands and the Porcelain <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Empire</span> Paradise were things I would never have come up with on my own, so they were full of potential.)<br/><br/>Then we made characters.  I requested (but did not demand) that a player's character come from a nation created by someone else.  FATE 3.0 is structured to make characters who already have back-story with one another -- and everyone came up with previous adventures with titles that were knock-offs of Bond movie titles, pretty much guaranteeing that international espionage would be a theme for the game, which up to that point I had never expected.  Obviously, the nations which had not been chosen as PC's home countries could be the 'bad guys'...<br/><br/>Some of the odd details created by the collaboration were completely off-the-cuff.  One player mentioned that his character was from the 'boondocks', and another player miss-heard the word.  "'<i>Boom-clock</i>'? What's a 'boom-clock'?"  And they were off and running... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  The answer turned out to be a peculiar Chronopian cultural quirk, and the reason that the two characters had met in the first place.<br/><br/>At another point, after we had discussed airships, the player in who's apartment we were playing pulled an old encyclopedia that he had inherited from his grandmother off the shelf, and showed us the article on 'Coronium' -- and suddenly we knew what lifted our airships. <br/><br/>The players chose a location from the nations we had defined as a place to start the game, and we were off!  Between sessions, I try to ask a question or suggest an idea to think about for next time. "What are the neighborhoods of the city called, and what are they like?", "What are the religions of this world like?", and so on.  Then, at the next session, everybody grabs some location and answers the question for it, creating the world as we go.  Sometimes the one of the players poses a question, during play:  "What kind of animals do people here keep as pets?", (which resulted in Arctic Bruins, among other things...) or "What is the national cuisine like in each country?" and anyone who wants to answer the question for a location does so.  I try to encourage the players to cross over with this; the person who originated the nation of Arkadia isn't the person who made up the Arkadian religion.  The Darric Empire was one of my example nations -- but I didn't make up their religion <i>or</i> their cuisine.  <br/><br/>From a GM perspective, this is the best of both worlds:  I have splat details that are given to me from outside my own imagination, which makes them 'fresh' to me and easily inspire new ideas -- and the splat is derived from the players, so I have a guarantee that these details are things that they are interested in.  The only problem I foresee is adding a new player somewhere down the line -- as we progress from setting-light to setting-heavy, the new player will have almost as much background to learn as someone just starting out with <b>Exalted</b>...<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208353/#Comment_208353" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T13:56:04+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  1:56PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>Any reason those 2 players got invested in the larger scheme of things?

I don't know that the other players -knew- they could help create setting, in fact, in general, that has been an issue, how to really communicate that to players and get their buy in. <br/><br/>The one player who was there every session was one of my best friends from the MIT gaming club, and it was his desire to play with me that led to the campaign, so I suspect a lot of his investment was due to a combination of desire, and that we only played if he was available (and motivated). I was probably also more responsive to his contributions as a result. The other player I think just clicked, but was probably also open to a higher level of player contribution. He was also involved in a Champions campaign that I think featured a lot of player contribution to the setting.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208422/#Comment_208422" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T20:25:03+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  8:25PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Judd,<br/><br/>Did you find the epilogue kind of worked to both reward ("Hey, we changed the world!") and challenge ("Wait, what happened?

There were definitely moments when the players would change and sharpen their Beliefs during the epilogues, get rid of dated  and we'd have the clear path to the next chapter's beginning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
