It's held generally twice a year (once in the Spring and once in the Fall) but occasionally falls through.  Anyway, if you're interested in attending this years Fall event the registration is now open:<br/><br/><a href="http://nerdlybeachparty.org/registration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nerdlybeachparty.org/registration</a><br/><br/>Further information can also be found at that site.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
