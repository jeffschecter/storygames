She should be more cautious.</blockquote>\nHmmm.  Someone wandering around by themselves has a nice sort of Biblical ring to it -- I don't recall any adventures right off the top of my head that were about going out into the desert to find some wandering hermit, but it sounds like it could be fun.<br/><br/>"Health [...] jeopardized by indiscretion" sounds like fun.  There's lots of 'find the cure for the Queen's illness' sorts of quests around, but they usually don't get into why she's fallen sick.  \n<blockquote><b>Lockjaw: </b> To dream that you have lockjaw, signifies there is trouble ahead for you, as some person is going to betray your confidence. For a woman to see others with lockjaw, foretells her friends will unconsciously detract from her happiness by assigning her unpleasant tasks. If stock have it, you will lose a friend.</blockquote>\nHunh.  I guess we know what's afflicting the Queen.  Or maybe not -- maybe <i>the entire royal court</i> has lockjaw -- everyone but the Queen.  That sounds like the sort of fairy tale curse we could expect from the Queen making an imprudent deal with a Witch to cast a spell to ensure her indiscretions are kept secret.  Yeah, I'm liking where that is going.  Maybe they're not literally with locked-jaw, but are rendered mute or unintelligible or something similar.<br/><br/>The only cure lies in getting that guy she was indiscreet with back -- but he was exiled off into The Vast Desert.  Waiting for the PCs to track him down.  And there's probably still the Witch to beat down, too.<br/><br/>That's the sort of random inspiration I was hoping to get out of this thing.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130986/#Comment_130986" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T13:40:27+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  1:40PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's odd, the first thought I got when clicking through a few samples was "heraldry".
