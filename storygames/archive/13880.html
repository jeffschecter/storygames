Their 2 spin off games, SAGA and Alternity, explicitly and implicitly supported player empowerment in their core mechanics. SAGA had it set up so that players determine actions for everything, both attack and defense, so everything is centered on them. In Alternity, it wasn't explicitly stated, but having a roll under system with a situation die modifier also gave players control. Rather than AD&amp;D where you'd roll to hit and then say "I hit AC 3 or better, is it a hit?" or d20 where you roll and say "I rolled a 25, does it hit?", you could go straight to rolling d20+situation die, comparing the result and saying "I hit for 7 damage". <br/><br/>They're different approaches to player empowerment, SAGA lets the players control any task resolution, and Alternity gives the players enough information from the results to narrate the outcome, without having to wait for confirmation or permission. I find this to be more empowering than fate/action points, which usually amount to a slight number boost or re-roll, but don't change anything else.<br/><br/>What I'm curious about, is what other systems have either implicit or explicit assumptions in their base mechanics that give players more control over the narrative, and not just through having a limited resource to introduce details into the game, but throughout the game having them tell the story of the action happening while the GM has more of a setting the scene role.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314401/#Comment_314401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-26T09:07:09+00:00" title="February 26, 2011  9:07AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you probably know these already, but <i>Apocalypse World</i>, <i>In a Wicked Age...</i>, and <i>The Pool</i> are all interesting examples that do this in different ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314450/#Comment_314450" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-26T20:16:41+00:00" title="February 26, 2011  8:16PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, nope.

If you take D20, there's very little difference between having the DM do all the rolls and having the player do the rolls, since the DM adjudicates anyway. If you have a system where the players know immediately that they've succeeded or not, there's the option to do something like rolling to attack, seeing that you hit and dealing the damage, and there's really no room for vetoeing it. <br/><br/>Charlie: (rolls dice) "Ragnar swings his axe and buries the blade deep in the Ogre's flesh for 13 damage."<br/><br/>vs<br/><br/>Charlie: (rolls dice) "I got a 19, does that hit the ogre?"<br/><br/>In the first example, Charlie's actually telling part of the story, in the second one, the GM is telling the whole story, with some occasional input from the players. It's rather like the difference between being on stage doing the improv and having a director who sets the scenes, and being in the audience and occasionally called upon to give some suggestions which the actors will work with. Audience with input vs creating a story.<br/><br/>Also, can I get some elaboration on how the 4 systems already mentioned achieve this, rather than just naming them? I'm a little familiar with DitV, but the part that I am familiar with actually seems to do the opposite (although the GM doesn't get to decide what happens, so in that case it balances the power, but that's more GM disempowerment than player empowerment from what I can see).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314499/#Comment_314499" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T07:21:28+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  7:21AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay. I think <i>The Pool</i> was, for many people, a seminal game in this regard. The other examples are all a little more subtle; this one is really in-your-face.<br/><br/>That game works like this:<br/><br/>When a situation comes up that requires a roll, the player rolls (never the GM). Either player or GM can call for a roll; neither can veto the other in this respect.<br/><br/>A roll consists of rolling a pool of six-sided dice. You must roll at least one "1" to succeed. This means that the only determiner of the difficulty is the number of dice rolled.<br/><br/>However, it is the player who decides how many dice to roll: s/he has a pool of dice and simply picks a number of them to roll. (In the original game, the GM can modify this slightly by adding a couple of dice, but it doesn't make a huge difference, and many people and many variants ignore that rule in any case.)<br/><br/>So as a player, when you want to accomplish something, can decide when you want to roll, and then effectively set the difficulty by choosing how many dice you will roll.<br/><br/>On top of that, when you succeed in a roll you can choose to gain another die *or* you can choose to narrate the outcome: describe *how* you succeed. This means that if you care enough about something in play, you can ask to roll, roll all your dice, and then describe exactly how it goes down.<br/><br/>When I first read <i>The Pool</i>, it shocked me, because up until then I'd never seen a game in which it was impossible for a GM to railroad the players (my friends still didn't believe it was possible, even after I told them about this game). It works due to a clever risk-balancing mechanic which effectively entices you to roll smaller numbers of dice (especially in some of the variants), since you risk losing any dice you roll.<br/><br/>I hope that helps. <i>The Pool</i> is often cited (and with good reason) as one of the seminal games of the indie/story game movement, and has been a powerful influence on many, many game designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314527/#Comment_314527" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T11:38:00+00:00" title="February 27, 2011 11:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you know the TN or or the AC or whatever, up front than you can narrate what happens after you roll pretty effectively.

Also, the dearth of rules in D20 is empowering in a sense because it lets players no explicitly how hard things are and what they need to do to reliably accomplish various effects, this is very different than SAGA, which, iirc, only has explicit rules for combat and spell casting and in the case of spell casting there's a lot of GM judgement calls as to where a particular effect falls on the various charts and tables.<br/><br/>Rule 0/house rules aside, the players have a very fixed set of abilities and expectations in D20, which I also see as a (different) form of player empowerment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314539/#Comment_314539" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T14:08:31+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  2:08PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So The Pool came in before Donjon, or roughly the same time?

It could be why people who aren't that familiar with the mechanics dislike it so much.<br/><br/>SAGA has explicit rules for general actions as well, with difficulties going up by 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, etc. in general, rather like WEG Star Wars. You could ask how difficult a task will be, and depending on the adjective you'd know it's within a couple points of each of those. For spellcasting, I always let the caster determine the cost, or I just didn't have a player that tried to do any blatant cheating, which is the only situation I can think of where it would be necessary. It's actually pretty well fleshed out in a similar fashion to d20, just not for every tiny little thing, which I find keeps it from getting overwhelming, and is also easier on the GM for not having to keep track of everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314543/#Comment_314543" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T14:40:40+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  2:40PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I'm not sure that what you're defining there (which I've always heard it awkwardly phrased as "player-facing rolls") is really about player empowerment, but:<br/><br/>* Unisystem games (Buffy, Angel), when dealing with non-important characters, are entirely player-facing.

He can roll the dice, know he has succeeded (in fact, in a reversal, the GM may have to ask him if he has succeeded, not the other way around), and immediately go to rolling damage or tell the GM that the NPC is mortally injured and needs to make a roll to stay conscious, or whatever.<br/><br/>For combat:<br/>Unisystem: Player declares attack, Player rolls dice, adds skill, reports result. The GM tells him it's a success, checks a table for how much he has succeeded, and tells him what damage to roll or whatever.<br/>Alternity: Player declares action, GM tells him difficulty, Player rolls dice, compares to skill, finds result, reports that and rolls damage. GM then applies armour if any, and reports if enemy is still standing.<br/><br/>Notice how the GM can't then fudge the result to turn a success into a failure. He can stack the deck by reporting a high difficulty, but it is transparent when he does this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314557/#Comment_314557" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T16:20:44+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  4:20PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having a named list of difficulties is not an explicit rules set, its a set of guidelines with a wide range of interpretation.

You might spend a few rounds fighting minions. You might say, "I'd like to jump that crevasse," or "How hard to topple that statue on a couple of the minions". Then when the fight is over, in one extended scene you might try to sneak past the guards, climb the wall, pick the lock, search the desk, decipher the code the notes are written in, hear the villain returning to his office, and run away without being caught. In unisystem, the GM would have to tell the player the difficulty in each case. In Alternity, the player will report whether he succeeded or failed, and how well or badly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314674/#Comment_314674" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T06:45:53+00:00" title="February 28, 2011  6:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True, yep,  I was only talking about the minion situation.

The Pool sounds like it's very much in that category. Having to check anything with the GM takes away from that, also having the GM handle rolls and tell you the results (particularly in secret), also takes away from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
