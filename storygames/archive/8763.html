Yes, perhaps I'm having mental difficulties, and I won't begrudge anyone who suggests as much.<br/><br/>Anyway, as soon as I sat down with HtHaD and began drawing my first underground river and gold vein, I fell in love with this thing, whatever you call it. It's awesome, simply put. But I can't deny that the way certain things are written have me all confused.<br/><br/>To be specific, I got stuck on C2 - Dwarven Civilization.<br/><br/>Problem 1. According to the text:<br/><br/>"<i>In spring</i>, Dwarves gather, mate, and pay to have their relatives move in with them. Gather up all (treasure)* that are connected to Dwarven tunnels and are not Dwarven Treasures. Draw a new room to store each (treasure) gathered, or place them in existing rooms where there is space."<br/><br/>At this point, I had one gold vein and no ore drawn on my map, so I had one Dwarven tunnel that went down to the vein, with one Dwarven barracks attached. I gathered up the gold, but wasn't sure where to draw the new room. Are there rules I should be following for this, or do I simply draw a new room wherever I please? The text isn't clear. And if I do draw a new room wherever I please, do I have to connect it to the surface? I'm assuming the "existing" rooms are ones I drew in the Prehistoric age, so they're forgotten, but still there. That leaves me with a fine place to put my (treasure), but it doesn't answer the question of what governs the drawing of new rooms.<br/><br/>Also, it's not clear at this point what, exactly, Dwarven Treasures are.<br/><br/>Problem 2. The text, again:<br/><br/>"For each (treasure) gathered, draw a Dwarven barracks connected to some other Dwarven construction and put a new (dwarf unit)** in it. Dwarves don't like to be too near to the noise of mining, so try not to put it on a mining tunnel."<br/><br/>I've gathered one (treasure), so I should draw another barracks and put a new (dwarf unit) in it. The problem is, it says to connect this barracks to some other Dwarven construction. The phase for creating Dwarven constructions doesn't come until fall (and we're still in spring). Where do I put this Dwarven barracks? Or can't I add it, since I don't have any constructions to connect it to?<br/><br/>Problem 3. The text:<br/><br/>"<i>In summer</i>, Dwarves mine....If there's no un-mined ore left on the map, 1(dwarf unit) immediately emigrates off the map looking for greener pastures."<br/><br/>This was the case for me. I had a gold vein, but no ore. So I began the Dwarven Civilization era of the game (per the rules) by having the Dwarves mine the gold vein, which gave them 1(treasure), which in turn created 1(dwarf unit). But I had no ore, which meant that unit left, leaving me again with only 1(dwarf unit). Then, when the fall comes and the Dwarves build, I don't have enough units (you need 3) to be able to build something. I felt stuck.<br/><br/>Problem 4. The text:<br/><br/>"<i>In winter</i>, the Dwarves mourn. If any Dwarves died this year, draw a Dwarven tomb."<br/><br/>Even though I felt stuck, I went on to the next season, to see if that would clarify things. Instead, it took me to a different kind of phase, which is no problem in and of itself. However, there's no indication of how Dwarves die. Does the player decide at random? That's fine, I'm comfortable making that choice and seeing what happens from it, but the text isn't clear. It would seem, from how the rest of the game works, that it would be decided through the application of a concrete mechanic, but there is no such mechanic described.<br/><br/>So here I am, with one Dwarven unit, no ore, unsure of how to mechanically mine my gold vein, and unsure if anyone's died or not. After writing this I feel like I'm being a big critical ass, but I'm just genuinely confused. Maybe I shouldn't have been drinking a beer while doing this. Am I missing something blatant? Feel free to make me look dumb, as long as you can tell me how to play.<br/><br/>In all sincerity, thanks for your game, Tony. I know I love it, I just have to figure it out first. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>*(treasure) = The white, unfilled-in circles<br/><br/>**(dwarf unit) = The black, filled-in circles                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193831/#Comment_193831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T21:54:19+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  9:54PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm not Tony, but here's how I have run it in my own play:<br/><br/>The whole gold vein is made of ore! Every mining season, they mine a chunk of it - token sized, as I recall - and take that gold. Eventually the whole vein will be replaced with mines.<br/><br/>Dwarves might be killed if they encounter some creatures left over from the primeval age. There may not be any on your map, so this might not matter. Possibly these can be added later due to certain events, too.<br/><br/>I always figured the dwarven treasures were just awesome stuff the dwarves made that they left behind. These will become significant in later ages when something else loots the lost dwarven caverns.<br/><br/>Just add your new dwarf rooms as required wherever makes sense. Think dwarfy. Just add it to some dwarf mines or corridors if there's nothing else yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193832/#Comment_193832" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T22:00:14+00:00" title="February 23, 2009 10:00PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Mike said.

At first it looks like a series of instructions for creating a dungeon, but in practice it's more like a set of guidelines that you apply according to your own taste. Because of this, I found it very hard to write, and occasionally simply failed to make it crystal clear. To help, there's a <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/HTHAD_FAQ_and_Errata.pdf" rel="nofollow">Frequently Asked Questions</a> doc. It covers some additional unclear bits, and fixes an outright mistake in the Dark Elves rules. Based on this post, I think a glossary might be a good addition. I apologize profusely for the problems in the text.<br/><br/>Because of the nature of the game, there's no guarantee you won't run into a completely crazy situation where completely weird stuff happens. It's just impossible to test for every situation that can arise. For example, I challenge Ben Lehman to give a description of his game that produced a massive undead Dwarven army. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  So when those things happen, it's best to make an interpretation that fits your idea of how things should properly work.

I'm assuming that only the starting "City" counts as a city and all colonies will be counted as Colonies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Spring: </b><br/>\nCity adds 1(B) if it has more (B) than (W).<br/>\nIf City has more than 1(B), found a colony if one can be reached, or dig a new passage towards one, or add 1(W) if no more colonies can be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Summer:</b><br/>\nColony digs a mine space, increases population by 1(B) and then increases population by 1(W) if (B) is greater than (W) (which it will be if there is no conflict and mining was done).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fall:</b><br/>\nConstruction<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Winter</b><br/>\nCity adds 1(W)<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Effectively, the city only grows if one of the slave population is killed as it starts with 3(B) and 3(W) and colonies take 1(B) and 1(W) to found. The main city remains in a state of weird imbalance as it sends out Drow and Slaves to found colonies and constantly refreshes the slave populace each winter, but does nothing to increase the decreasing drow population. In a game with 2 mithril deposits, the city has a slave revolt pretty early in play, leaving only the colonies to fend for themselves, and colonies don't have the ability to create new colonies. Is this intentional or a result of me misreading the intent of these rules?</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Surface Kingdoms</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAs I'm playing this, the Castle grows by 1(B) every turn (until it hits 5(B)) and also creates a new farm every turn to support it (which comes into play with 1(B), not taken from the castle unless there was an empty farm for someone from the castle to move into). So barring monsters attacking (which has only happened once in my three games), it will take 5 seasons before the Surface Kingdom castle becomes fully supported and then can start launching excursions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I found it interesting that the Thought Lord Cult doesn't start attached to the dungeon proper. In my last game this meant that the adventurers walzed into the dungeon after a few seasons and cleaned the whole place out EXCEPT for the Thought Lord Cult. The next year, the thought lords had to try to take over the Surface Kingdoms, since there were no monsters at all left in the dungeons (and failed, causing thought lord casualties), and at the end of that year instead of adventurers showing up to delve the deeps, a squad of skeletons showed up in a tomb. When the weakened thought lords failed to take over said skeletons, they died of brain starvation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm definitely considering writing up a new civilization or two... a frog-people who fish along the underground river instead of exploiting ore and mithril (mainly because in my last game I had a dwarven civ mine the majority of the gold ore, and then the first delving group mined the rest of it, resulting in a series of mines that bisected the map completely, and not enough attention was spent, IMO, on the very cool underground river just below it).<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, it's funny to watch the poor dragon get chased around the map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194386/#Comment_194386" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T08:36:47+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  8:36AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, thanks for the good feedback! I'm very proud of HtHaD, but there are many points where the game can be improved. Fortunately, I'm well on my way to a second printing, which will also mean an update of the rules and the PDF.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dyson Logos</cite><br><em>Effectively, the city only grows if one of the slave population is killed as it starts with 3(B) and 3(W) and colonies take 1(B) and 1(W) to found. The main city remains in a state of weird imbalance as it sends out Drow and Slaves to found colonies and constantly refreshes the slave populace each winter, but does nothing to increase the decreasing drow population. In a game with 2 mithril deposits, the city has a slave revolt pretty early in play, leaving only the colonies to fend for themselves, and colonies don't have the ability to create new colonies. Is this intentional or a result of me misreading the intent of these rules?</em>.<br/></br></blockquote>\nYes, all other things being equal, the Dark Elf city flames out pretty quickly. We made some edits to the Dark Elf stuff late in the production of the game, and the edits actually made the section less clear, which is my fault. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>  As an alternate rule, I suggest making one of the colonies into the new "city" if the main city fails. This gives a bit more dynamic civilization. \n<blockquote>So barring monsters attacking (which has only happened once in my three games), it will take 5 seasons before the Surface Kingdom castle becomes fully supported and then can start launching excursions.</blockquote>\nThat's correct. Sometimes the SK interact heavily with the dungeon, sometimes they sit out most of the age of monsters.<br>\n<blockquote> When the weakened thought lords failed to take over said skeletons, they died of brain starvation.</blockquote>\nThat is a great story. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>I'm definitely considering writing up a new civilization or two... a frog-people who fish along the underground river instead of exploiting ore and mithril.</blockquote>\nWhat a great idea! Underground rivers really are super cool, and anything that gives them more cred is awesome. If you write this up, post it here or send it to me and I'll stick it in a free supplement PDF with some other stuff I'm collecting!                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194422/#Comment_194422" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T10:09:41+00:00" title="February 26, 2009 10:09AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Underground rivers really do have a lot of potential.

Is that supposed to include the colonies, or just the city proper (in which case, no one gets an extra slave, since the other two groups of Dark Elves are colonies of the first city).<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, if a colony runs out of mining resource (no more gems in the cave, no more ore in the mithral vein), what happens? As it stands, that colony becomes... dormant. It doesn't grow or subdivide in the spring, can't mine in the summer, population remains unchanged so it doesn't build, and since it's a colony instead of a city it doesn't requisition slaves from the tunnels or acquire new slaves in the winter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, this last point becomes moot if I adopt the "largest colony becomes the city when the city falls" optional rule. I would actually suggest making that an actual rule in the next printing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd reading Bret's post made me think of something else...
