Since I\u2019m not a native speaker: please be gentle.;-D<br/>OK, this is about a resolution mechanic I\u2019ve been developing and alpha-testing for quite a while. I\u2019m calling it my \u2018dual core\u2019, which is a shiftless name. It\u2019s a mashup of a long train of thoughts and some recently added concepts of the Apocalypse World Engine. (That\u2019s why I figured: I should ask the story-games community...)<br/>I know you guys would like some design-goals in order to give feedback, and I\u2019ve got them up my sleeves. But for now, I\u2019d just like you to try the meat and tell me how you think it tastes. I\u2019ll be talking about the bones later.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The tools</b></span><br/>There\u2019s two \u2018referees\u2019: the dice (2d6) and a deck of cards (I use Tarot, but a deck of rummy will serve just fine).<br/>The dice need to be of different colour. One is declared to be positive (green/white), the other one is negative (red/black). I call them D\xb1.<br/>All players and the GM hold a hand of cards. They\u2019ll be used to describe actions, to extend actions (retry them), to perform secure actions (cards replacing dice), and to unlock special actions. That\u2019s why I call them action-cards (clever me...).<br/><br/>There\u2019s two results from each check as well: CONTROL and DRAMA.<br/><b>CONTROL</b> decides between success and failure. Additionaly you might use it as an indicator of efficiency or style (eg. how fast / how economic / how graceful).<br/><b>DRAMA</b> tells you how the story-arc progresses. Every single test will change something in the fiction (be it a character, a relationship, or the options to act). My goal is to incorporate Robert McKee\u2019s \u201cbeats\u201d into a resolution mechanic. (Something AW is achieving with ease.)<br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Determine success</b></span><br/>When you do a check, the GM determines the RISK of the action, somewhere on a ladder from -5 to +5, with zero (\xb10) being average.<br/>The player rolls both d6\u2019s and reads the lower of the two results. The colour of the respective die determines whether it\u2019s plus or minus. Doubles are considered \xb10. So your final result ranges from -5 to +5. Add (or subtract) some character traits and you end up with your CONTROL. If you reach or surpass the RISK, the action was succesfull.<br/><br/>On a success, the GM plays a card. On a failure one of your cards will be drawn. (More on the interpretation later.)<br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bring on the DRAMA</b></span><br/>Now add up the dice and the RISK (without any algebraic signs). The sum equals your DRAMA (standard: ranging from 2 to 12). The Drama is measured on the wheel of fortune:<br/><img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15427036/wheel_of_fortune.jpg"/><br/><br/>As you may see, between 12 and 2 lies the ACE. It resembles 1 as well as 13. If your DRAMA goes above 13, start again from two. If it falls below 1, count down from 12. It\u2019s just like reading the clock, really. <br/>The wheel of fortune is divided into four grades. 2-4 = 1st grade, 5-7 = 2nd grade, 8-10 = 3rd grade, 11-ACE = 4th grade. (The RISK actually just changes the probabilities for reaching the different grades.) For each grade, the player may choose one of the following outcomes:<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><i>On a success</i> - <b>Get what you intended:</b> Ask for a kind of fact (don\u2019t declare the fact yourself). If the GM agrees, she may draw a new card.<br/><i>On a failure</i> - <b>Learn from your mistakes:</b> Draw a new card.<br/><br/><i>Note: if you don\u2019t choose this option, the action will prolong - with an additional check.</i><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><b>Keep track of the situation:</b> If succesfull, you draw the GMs card. On a failure you choose the card you\u2019re loosing.<br/><br/><i>Note: If you don\u2019t choose this option, the GM determines the cards.</i><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><b>Stay in charge:</b> Avoid problems.<br/><br/><i>Note: If you don\u2019t choose this option, the GM draws a card (face up on the table). It can (and will) be used as a complication in the upcoming scene.</i><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><b>Get more out of it:</b> Create a advantage. Draw a card (face up on the table). You may use it as a bonus in the upcoming scene.<br/><br/><i>Note: If you don\u2019t choose this option, you simply don\u2019t get an advantage.</i><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><b>BONUS:</b> If you reach the ACE you get all four options (since it\u2019s 4th grade). In addition you may draw a new card, expanding your hand of action-cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>That\u2019s it for now</b></span><br/>There\u2019s some more stuff on card-interpretation, special actions, extended actions and the correspondence. But right now, I\u2019d love to get some feedback, impressions, and opinions.<br/><br/>Thanks, I\u2019d be really grateful                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434734/#Comment_434734" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T15:34:43+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  3:34PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the incorporation of the cards...but I'm struggling to figure out what the dice mechanic adds, given how involved it is and how much you need to figure out.

With the absolute value of the RISK from 0-5 labelling the rows below, and the quadrants of your wheel of fortune from 1-4 labelling the columns, the value in each cell is the number of times out of 36 you get that quadrant. Since we're using absolute value of RISK, it could be seen as a measure of extremity -- 5 represents both the easiest and the hardest tasks. <br/><br/>So there's a tendency to get more of the options at more extreme RISKs, but even that's not consistent. For the easiest and hardest tasks (-5 and +5 RISK), there's only a 6% chance of getting 2 options and a whopping 44% chance of getting 4 options, but a 25% at getting either 1 option or 3 options.\n<pre><br/>|   | 1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |<br/>|---+---+----+----+----|<br/>| 0 | 6 | 15 | 12 |  3 |<br/>| 1 | 3 | 12 | 15 |  6 |<br/>| 2 | 2 |  9 | 16 |  9 |<br/>| 3 | 3 |  6 | 15 | 12 |<br/>| 4 | 6 |  3 | 12 | 15 |<br/>| 5 | 9 |  2 |  9 | 16 |<br/></pre>\nAnd the dice mechanic is a complicated way of saying d6-d6 (which is the same as 2d6-7.) If you let the RISK be in the range 2-12, you could let them be read as just straight up 2d6, but you'd have to do something different to measure the DRAMA.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434742/#Comment_434742" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-02T19:35:27+00:00" title="July  2, 2014  7:35PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the complexity of the dice system you propose is justified based on what you've written here.

It's really helpful! <i>Btw: Not posting my design-goals, really seems to work for me. It\u2019s kind of the reactions I\u2019d expect from first-time players.</i><br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">@CarpeGuitarrem</a>:</b> I'm pleased that you like the concept for the cards. I'm aiming for a dynamic between dice and cards, where dice represent your "standard action", while cards trigger "special moments" (in a dramaturgic sense). But you may be right. Since there's <i>always</i> a card to be played after doing a check I might have blurred this principle (I just added this rule). I\u2019ll be thinking about ways to avoid this procedure.<br/>Regarding the complexity: There\u2019s several elements I really want to keep. (Please take a look at my answer to Paul_T.) If I (or someone else) can figure out an easier way - I\u2019d be happy about that.<br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/profile/zedlopez">@zedlopez</a>:</b> Thanks for the effort and providing the chart. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> It\u2019s motivating to see someone actually trying to wrap his head around my ideas.<br/>Regarding the chances, I actually want it to be that way: Higher chances of gaining a huge benefit also increase the possibility of things going wrong.<br/>But I get your argument. -5 to +5 may result in unwanted probabilities. I will reduce the GM\u2019s latitude from -3 to +4. And I will allow the player to  add +1 or +2. This will enable the PCs to take \u2018high risk actions\u2019 (+6), in order to strive for the ACE (18.18%).<br/>As for the d6-d6, I\u2019ve heard a lot of different opinions on that one - and peronally I like my version. [EDIT: It's possible to exchange <i>lowest of 2d6</i> with <i>d6-d6</i>. But it will change the interaction between CONTROL and DRAMA. I sometimes used it in 'grittier' games.] But thanks again for pointing out, since my main concern is me being to complicated.<br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/profile/arscott">@arscott</a>:</b> I exactly wanted to get clarification about this kind of impressions. So thanks a lot, I will put this into consideration.<br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>:</b> Yes, you\u2019re absolutly right - it\u2019s 2d6+trait and the number of choices. It also adds scale for style, but that\u2019s really just a byproduct.<br/>Most important: I badly wanted to uncouple the dimension of \u2018success-or-failure\u2019 from the dimension of \u2018drama-progression\u2019 (the options). Now there\u2019s 32 possible outcomes, excluding the variance of style.*<br/>And I wanted a system, wherein the GM is free to choose a difficulty. But I want this difficulty to also have a benefit for the player. I\u2019m really not a big fan of total GM-freedom. ;D<br/>Finally I'm really glad you like the four options. They're in fact the heart of my new concept. So it's good to hear, that I might be on the right track. The options might be altered though. Since I maybe withdrawing the rule: 'card after the check' <i>(see <a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem%29">@CarpeGuitarrem)</a></i>.<br/><br/><br/>*Here\u2019s how I count my 32 outcomes:<br/>---------------------------<br/>  2x4 (yes/no &amp; 1 option) <br/>+ 2x6 (yes/no &amp; 2 options)<br/>+ 2x4 (yes/no &amp; 3 options)<br/>+ 2x1 (yes/no &amp; 4 options)<br/>+ 2x1 (yes/no &amp; ACE)<br/>---------------------------                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434863/#Comment_434863" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T03:46:28+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  3:46AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2014 4:24AM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are many ways to tie mechanical and semiotic structures together, on many levels, to create a wide variety of experiences falling somewhere between earlier definitions of "stories" and "games" - and for that matter, "writing", "acting", "interfacing with a computer" and any other creative activity you can think of.  Over the last couple decades we've made significant advances in particular approaches to particular solutions.  Some hypotheses have crystallized into theory, some subgenres have appeared, some broadly-useful classifications of design methodologies and playstyles have been established and a Big Model has been proposed.  But we're still in a pretty early stage.  Looking for the third gen.<br/><br/>Because storygame design and its sibling disciplines are still in their preliminary stages, we should expect to see (and participate in) a lot of deconstruction, analysis and experimentation.  We should hope that these experiments are as broad and diverse as the conceptual spaces we intend to model, because there's a long way to go and a lot of experiments to be run.<br/><br/>My first reaction was "this seems a bit too mathy and could get in the way of the fiction".  But my second reaction was "shit there really is something intriguing about using dice and cards together, and that wheel looks pretty cool".  My engineering mind recognizes that separating <i>Control</i> from <i>Drama</i> and viewing them as orthogonal to each other is like a 4-wheel-drive for a third-gen engine.  Which means I'm totally on that page with you.  :-)  Ultimately, I think I'd have to drive it around a little bit before jumping to a conclusion.  Take some friends on a road trip.<br/><br/>Regardless, I'm always happy to see a new type of experiment.

I already got some charts, I will try to complete a master table. Maybe there should be a spreadsheet showing the 32 possible outcomes, too?<br/><br/>As for new cards, I consider them to be crucial. You may prolong an action spending a card - effectively inflating the check into a full conflict. If you do this repeatedly, the side running out of cards first will have to give in ultimately. Spend cards will rise the stakes of the conflict. I will try to phrase this option a little bit clearer.<br/>Beyond that, cards also unlock secure and special actions (which I haven't explained yet). <br/>After all, these rules have been adjusted just recently. I will need more playtesting to evaluate if it's remotely working the way I envision it. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434901/#Comment_434901" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-06T01:06:55+00:00" title="July  6, 2014  1:06AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Should I put together a small beta-document?</blockquote>I don't want to assign your work to you, and I can't necessarily promise (because my group runs on consensus), but I'd be glad to pitch it for a playtest.

I don't take it for granted that you guys check out the work of a stranger, who has not (yet) participated in other discussions.\n<blockquote>However, I still don't really understand the purpose of the complex mechanic and the strange odds. An explanation or a master probability chart would help. </blockquote>\nAlright, I tried to come up with some explenation, and that prooved a valuable thing for me to do. But it got a little bit lengthy. So if you're really interested in the whole thought process (including a lot of design-goals), you might take a look at this Google-Document:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14N8BVT4V7u-pBGeltm0ZZ0cTN7ABQpEmf6lZsQ5PAhs/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/14N8BVT4V7u-pBGeltm0ZZ0cTN7ABQpEmf6lZsQ5PAhs/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>I'll try to focus on three rather simple questions here...<br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Why dice and cards? What does the one add to the other?</b></span><br/>The dice do what dice tend to do in roleplaying games. They serve as a referee to your characters actions. Everytime you ask them, they\u2019re there\u2026<br/><br/>The cards on the other hand serve as a resource. They make your characters special. They provide the power to do special things and stuff beyond the ordinary. In a lot of ways, they are just like the Fate-Tokens, Plot-Points, Story-Power-Coins or whatever you wanna call what's already out there.<br/>But there\u2019s a little bit more to them, of course. Since cards have a value and meaning of their own, you may interpret them (just like a fortuneteller). It might make sense to swap one card against another.<br/>Most importantly, if cards are abled to do different things, suddenly they interact more closely with my feeling of play. In Odys|SE your cards will enable you to act in <i>certain ways</i> (related to their suite and value). So they should have an impact on your characters behaviour and condition.<br/>If I, as a player, have a bunch of Fate-Points, my feelings vary solely on their amount. With the cards, two different cards will trigger different feelings.<br/>So if a story event triggers a rule, and the rule in turn changes my cards, my character and I have just been influenced by the fiction. And I love that.<br/><br/>Eventually running out of cards has proven as an appropriate countdown for extended tasks. These are just adjoining checks, that lead to something like a conflict-system without needing another subset of rules.<br/><br/><i>On a sidenote: I used the principle of always playing a card on a check. Since I want the cards to distinguish fateful actions from ordinary ones (dice), this idea seems to be wrong. I now tried to provide a way of achieving the same goals, without the ever-present feeling of loss. (I got that realization thanks to CarpeGuitarrem.)</i><br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why two results? It takes quite long to read them.</span></b><br/>I always loved the concept of \u201crich rolling\u201d or \u201crich dice\u201d. Ever since I interchanged d10s in Warhammer FRPG. I met it again in Unknown Armies, the One Roll Engine, Don\u2019t Rest Your Head, and a lot of other stuff. There\u2019s just so much information you may gain for your fiction.<br/><br/>By uncoupling CONTROL and DRAMA (or: <i>quality</i> and <i>impact</i>) I believe it\u2019s possible to model some narrative structures. You may induce problems, no matter how skilled you are. You may gain new opportunities, even if you\u2019ve got no chance to succeed at all (i.e. change and/or win cards). Or you may simply determine hit and damage in a single roll.<br/><br/>Personally I think it\u2019s not to hard to calculate the two results:<br/>A) Look for the lower die and mind the algebraic sign<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Add up two dice and read the clock\u2026 which takes us to:<br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Why do you use a strange device like the wheel?</b></span><br/>The wheel-of-fortune might look a bit intimidating at first glance. But it\u2019s there for a reason. (And after all, we all know how to read the clock. ;-)<br/>CONTROL and DRAMA both deliver eleven possible outcomes (-5 to +5 / 2 to 12). Even the probability curve behaves the same way. That enables me to use the very same modifier (RISK) on both of them. Achieving a tool for the GM, where a handicap for the PC always goes along with an advantage for the player.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s take a look at the four steps of the wheel. Steps one (2-4) and two (5-7) will always demand concessions from the player. Step three (8-10) will provide the outcomes he very much aims for (even on a failure). On these steps, the terms of consequence are his to choose.<br/>Step four (11-Ace) will gain him a bonus (yes, and\u2026 / not, but\u2026) and the Ace will even surpass that by boosting the character with another steady card.<br/>I wanted these outcomes to be possible for every character, no matter how skilled or incompetent. That\u2019s why I designed the wheel instead of a simple table. RISK is just a possibility to adjust the chances to taste. <br/><br/>Finally, the numbers 2-12 - and the non-ordinary stance of the ACE - translate really nicely to the playing cards. You just have to assign the values 11 and 12 to the face cards. Which again reflects in their exposed function as grade four. <br/><br/><br/><i>As for the strange odds: I think it\u2019s reasonable, that higher chances of benefits also increase the hazard of complications. But I'm working on a paper with an extended study of stochastics. I'll post a link once I'm done.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Henning" title="Henning"><img alt="Henning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Henning">Henning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435162/#Comment_435162" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-11T09:33:03+00:00" title="July 11, 2014  9:33AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2014 9:33AM by Henning.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Update <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, finished the prototype of the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15427036/odys_se_charsheet_beta2.pdf" rel="nofollow">character-sheet</a> (Dropbox-Link, 541kB).
