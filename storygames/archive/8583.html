I threatened around lunchtime to run OD&amp;D, and got taken up on the threat, so I had to whip up a dungeon quick. Tony Dowler's <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/DungeonMaps.aspx" rel="nofollow">For the Love of Dungeons</a> saved my bacon. Over a bowl of pasta at Noodles and Company, I was able to take his "Haunted Mine" map and whip up a fantastically fun adventure.<br/><br/>From our experience, you can make a 4-6 hour adventure out of each of these maps. We played for about 2 hours and 15 minutes and finished about half of the Haunted Mine. Anyway, I just wanted to throw big ups to Tony for this product: it's a great game aid.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190191/#Comment_190191" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T06:52:46+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  6:52AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Clinton, it was fun!

So, I already had this giant map of the underworld I'd made last weekend with How to Host a Dungeon. I didn't know I'd be running D&amp;D on Monday, but synchronicity happened.<br/><br/>There's a specific thing in role-playing that I don't think has a name, but happens a lot. If you take your own preconceptions and add outside input, the input seems to match your thoughts and expand upon them perfectly, even if not related. On my big map, I had an ancient cavern that'd been opened by dwarves 1000 years ago. It's not far from the surface and was part of their mining complex, so I figured I'd use that for an adventure. I dug through my adventures and nothing fit, but then I flipped through <em>For the Love</em> and saw "The Haunted Mine" and thought "ok!" There's names in all these rooms, and they instantly start connecting. I saw "Mind Tombs" and remembered that elsewhere, deep on my big map, I had a horrible enemy, the Thought Lords. That clicked, and I realized I could use that as an influence. "Tombs" and "Haunted" made me remember my undead dwarves elsewhere on the big map, so I added them here, too. A room called "What Lies Here?" with a secret room to the side - well, it had to be a wight king laying there, with his hidden treasure room.<br/><br/>Even though none of that was on either map - mine or Tony's - the two together generated a lot of meat. I was able to come up with an adventure over a bowl of pasta, complete with hooks to a bigger campaign, in 45 minutes. That doesn't really reflect on me as much as the evocativeness of the map and the technique I described.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190321/#Comment_190321" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T16:28:13+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  4:28PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton,<br/><br/>   Could you describe how you went about designing the encounters/challenges for the game?
