Seemed to make sense that a game with emergent Buddhist elements would follow those sorts of guidelines. Plus, I thought it'd be a fun challenge.<br/><br/>Consequently, I've been working on a system based drawing and adding beads to a bag, then tweaking the economy and probabilities of that central mechanic. It's been a fruitful, but problematic experience that I've only just now fully articulated to my ever-patient girlfriend Shannon.<br/><br/>I was telling her about the <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/622575.html" rel="nofollow">Fudge+ORE hack</a> I posted this morning and how it would be super-cool for Do, but that the Buddha games list prohibits dice-rolling mechanics. The hack has several elements that I'd been approaching with the bead mechanic. And, truth be told, I could probably simulate a lot of the Fudge hack's mechanics with beads, but it'd just be <i>easier</i> with dice.<br/><br/>She questioned the value of using the Buddha games list at this point. I told her about the benefits of designing within restrictions, how many cool games have been developed this way, how solving the problems can be a source of unexpected creative energy... but she remained unconvinced.<br/><br/>If I'm trying to reach a goal for the overall game's design, and the best way to do that requires breaking restrictions I'd been bending anyway, why not do so?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101520/#Comment_101520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T09:37:45+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  9:37AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>When they stop working.

Originally I scribbled down a mechanic in a 30 minute design contest and came up with something with no dice and only one type of test (changing reality). Since then I have tinkered with lots of things but I have tried very hard to keep to that original set of concepts, even when people have pointed out how useful dice would be, for example. Like you I can't necessarily justify this except that I feel that it is right, and I would say that if you feel that it is *right* to stick with your restrictions and your original concept then go with your heart and do it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, although I have not added dice, I have added other types of test (to do with fighting the Shadow) because I could see that those rules really couldn't be avoided. So I've stuck with one restriction through thick and thin, but I gave up the other (only one type of test) when I could see that the game was just going to be bad if I didn't.<br/><br/>Which is a long way of agreeing with the idea that you should give up on the restriction when you have to because the game won't work if you don't, but not till then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101541/#Comment_101541" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T13:06:45+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  1:06PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Always.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101549/#Comment_101549" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T14:28:04+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  2:28PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>If I'm trying to reach a goal for the overall game's design, and the best way to do that requires breaking restrictions I'd been bending anyway, why not do so?</blockquote>\nThere is nothing that makes breaking this <em>permanent.</em>  Break it, see if you like it, and use that as a point of data.  I personally am having to deal with this with Know Thyself right now.  I'm highly considering removing them from the game for a few tests -- in spite of why I want to keep them -- to see how that impacts the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101550/#Comment_101550" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T14:29:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  2:29PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My feeling is that you shouldn't ditch your constraints simply because something shiny and new has grabbed your attention.  As you've said in the past, your design methodology is a lot about throwing tons of ideas at the wall and taking away the few ideas that stick.  I think, ultimately, that this idea is too <i>young</i> to make a decision as to whether or not it has stuck, yet.<br/><br/>Also, I don't feel like Fudge dice are "Buddha" or "Zen" enough for me.  Your current idea involves drawing differently-colored pebbles from a bag.  <i>That feels more apt for your game</i> because it feels more like a Zen way of doing things ("when you can take this pebble from my hand...").<br/><br/>For <i>every single idea you have</i>, I would encourage you to run it through an aesthetic, tonal filter first.  Does the mechanic reinforce the theme, the feel of your game?  If it involves tactile assets for the game, do those tactile assets manifest in a way that reinforces theme and tone?<br/><br/>I don't think the Fudge dice do.  I think white pebble, black pebble, grey pebble (or whatever) drawn from a sack does, much more.<br/><br/>I want the tactile and visual manifestation of your game to look like a Zen rock garden, I guess.<br/><br/>Think about that before you get all distractipated.  And stop worrying about whether or not folks will have to go to the hobby store to stock up for your game.  Gamers have plenty of glass beads or differently-colored dice or poker chips lying around, in my experience, and they'll work fine for your stuff-in-a-bag idea.<br/><br/>So, that all said, this is the filter I actually care about.  The Buddha Games List restrictions, I care a lot less about when it comes down to it -- because while I think that helps restrict you in ways that produce and reinforce the theme of the game, it doesn't guarantee it.  So the List is a secondary filter, and an optional one at that.  (But again, I don't think the Fudge Dice gig is necessarily theme-appropriate; if you can make the case that it is, then you'd have a better chance of convincing me.)<br/><br/>There's a reason that the most important question that the various designer buddhas ask is "What is your game about?" -- Because your true, deep answer to <i>that</i> is your real filter, your real restriction.  Everything else is just a tool to help you achieve the about-ness of your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment"

all about shooting sacred cows in the service of better design, but my dilemma was trying to decide which cow to shoot. ^_^<br/><br/>So, I've slept on it.<br/><br/>The original question was: If I can produce the same mechanics with dice as with beads, but it's just easier with dice, why not go for that?<br/><br/>I flipped that around this morning: If I can produce the same results with beads as with dice, but it's more in keeping with the overall aesthetic of the game to use beads, why not go for that?<br/><br/>On further introspection, I think what was most tempting about using dice is that it was easier to <i>write</i> the system as dice-based because there is already a vocabulary established there. In writing a bead-based system, I have to reference an ever-evolving glossary to make sure I'm using the most consistent and clear terminology. Still, that's no reason to shoot that cow.<br/><br/>I think I can write notes as if the system were dice-based, just to get the ideas down very quickly, but the final form will be most definitely bead-based. Plus, I can still include the dice-based mechanics as a sidebar or appendix.<br/><br/>Thanks, guys.

It's easier to <i>write</i> the system using dice, but I don't think it will be easier on the player's end.<br/><br/>Here's one thing beads are good for: A non-numerical infrastructure for fluctuating, player-controlled probabilities and economy.\n<blockquote>For example, let's say white beads are "success" and black beads are "failure." (This is not actually the case for Do, but let's just go with it for the sake of argument.) If there is a bag on the table with a black and white bead inside. I have a 50/50 chance of drawing one or the other. (That's basically like rolling a d2.)<br/><br/>Let's also say that this hypothetical game has a Fan Mail mechanic. Another player thinks what my character is doing is really cool, so before I draw, she contributes a white bead towards my success by placing it in the bag. The chances of my success are now two times higher than failure. (Now I'd have to roll a d3 to get the same probabilities.)<br/><br/>The player playing my opponent doesn't like this one bit, so he contributes two black bead towards my failure and places them in the bag. There are now two white beads and three black beads in the bag. Not good odds for my success. (Forget the d2 and d5, now I have to roll a d5!)<br/><br/>It's time to draw. I reach into the bag and get a white bead. I beat the odds! w00t!<br/><br/>Here's the kicker: After I've drawn, the bag is <i>not</i> reset. Any beads that were contributed this round remain in the bag for further rounds. This represents the karmic repercussions of character's actions.</blockquote>\nThe way the probabilities of success shifted around in that example would've required keeping track of some arithmetic. I would've also had to change the type of dice I used with each new fan mail contribution.<br/><br/>With beads, all the math is kept in the bag. It's like a super low-tech computer.<br/><br/>The biggest benefit of beads in a bag is in the last sentence of that example. They cleanly and elegantly handle karma without requiring anyone to keep track of modifiers, bonuses or penalties. I <i>could</i> model this by using a kind of River mechanic as is used in Weapons of the Gods, but keeping everything in the bag is so much more neat and tidy.<br/><br/>And y'know what? Now I'm questioning whether it really is all that much easier to write the system with dice. Heh. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101609/#Comment_101609" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T04:06:15+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  4:06AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds (a) a lot easier to write with beads and (b) cool! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101643/#Comment_101643" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T07:36:45+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  7:36AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2007 7:37AM by J_Walton.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I don't think the Buddha would play games that involve drawing random beads out of a bag either.

The thing about beads is that they're just asking to be strung on a string, and that's not really what Do uses them for.  Pebbles are way more Zen anyway.<br/><br/><b>Oooo, inspiration!</b>  A string of prayer beads would be a different way to play.  You could close your eyes and count prayer beads until you reached the end of a sutra and then look at whatever bead was currently in between your fingers.  Bingo, Buddhist randomizer!

For now, the three colors represent three possible outcomes for your character at the end of the pilgrimage. Black beads represent your character leaving the temple and remaining in the worlds outside, kind of like a Bodhisattva. The white beads represent your character staying in the temple. There is a third transcendent path, represented by a third color (maybe grey), where you can choose your character's destiny. (This had been previously represented by the absence of either black or white beads, but I couldn't get the economies to work quite right, so I'm just going with three beads instead of two.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102699/#Comment_102699" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T10:04:47+00:00" title="October 12, 2007 10:04AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            World, Temple, Destiny.<br/><br/>Anyone got some compact monosyllables from those?

Inside + Outside don't really make one thing.  There's inside something and outside something.  When you combine them you get... everything.<br/><br/>Martial arts techniques, for example, are divided into internal (Nei) and external (Wai).  When you use them together, I'm not sure what you call it.  Probably something like "Neiwai" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103133/#Comment_103133" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T16:43:58+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  4:43PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2007 4:44PM by iago.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nei/Wai/Jun does the trick, Daniel, if you're willing to go with that.
