All down-time activities would be freeform - they'd still be on the list of things to do, but it'd just be talking about stuff rather than mechanics. Basically just a dicing mechanic that tells you how long the story is yet going to last, and who gets shit in the eye while waiting for the story to end. Drop the confessionals as a formal mechanic, of course.<br/><br/>For modern design sensibilities, I wouldn't change anything in particular - there isn't a particular group-think out there relevant to the issue. For my own ideal edition I'd put in more elaborate campaign rules (think 3:16 level of complexity) with a little bit more focus on office politics/satire, and I'd make the story development less No Myth (e.g. a Once Upon a Time deck or similar constraint/structure, something to give situations a bit more meat), plus I'd maybe fiddle a bit with some mechanical details.

I haven't played Inspectres, but it seems to me (from reading other peoples' replays/detailed Actual Play accounts) that success is remarkably easy and consistent. (It's pretty easy to roll at least 3-4 dice all the time, which means failures are very rare.)<br/><br/>The GM is supposed to compensate by applying a lot Stress, but this seems almost kind of the reverse of what you'd expect in the genre.

Although I would never get rid of the confessionals. That's one of the most unique things about the game, isn't it?<br/><br/>I really think using some other form for the dice values, as you suggest would be great (a la Cthulhu Dark).<br/><br/>For example:\n<blockquote><br/>* Roll one die by default.<br/>* Add a die if this is your character's field of expertise.<br/>* Add a die if you are doing something desperate, irrational, or stupid.<br/>* Add a die if you have the support of a colleague <br/>(or whatever other dynamic you want to support)<br/></blockquote>\n(You'd have to work out a clever way for this to interact with Stress, of course. It could be as simple as Stress subtracting from your rolled result or some such.)<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>One thing which prompted me to start this thread, is noticing that there IS actually a bit of design tradition of games derived from or similar to Inspectres:<br/><br/>* Ghost Lines (the "serious" version of Inspectres)<br/>* Drakar Och Bananer <br/>* Donjon<br/>* Something like Cthulhu Dark (crossing that game with The Pool results in something very Inspectres-like)<br/><br/>Vincent's "Storming the Wizard's Tower" also had some features in common, although that's more of a stretch...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450300/#Comment_450300" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-04T10:39:23+00:00" title="January  4, 2016 10:39AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2016 10:40AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd make the story development less No Myth (e.g. a Once Upon a Time deck or similar constraint/structure, something to give situations a bit more meat)</blockquote>\nYeah.

I was thinking of Ghostbusters (arguably the only genre source for this game), but you make a solid point nevertheless. <br/><br/>Does this effect show up in a one-shot, or only over the long-term?<br/><br/>Another thought:<br/><br/>I'd like to make more of the tension between completing the mission (Franchise dice) and resolving the supernatural problem. After all, it's possible to earn enough dice without solving the "problem", or vice-versa. Perhaps this is fertile ground to build some interesting decisions into the game?<br/><br/>The first thing that comes to mind is leaning on the characters' sense of justice and positioning that against the success of the Franchise.<br/><br/>If you have earned enough dice to "succeed", but the situation doesn't seem resolved yet, you can:<br/><br/>1) Heartless and cold, a true professional, you pack up and go home. You did what you were supposed to do, taking the money, even if you're leaving people in a terrible situation.<br/><br/>2) Risk further Stress and further damaging your Franchise in exchange for helping people and being the most compassionate ghost-hunter you can be. (Maybe this earns you some kind of relationships with those people, perhaps even an alternate way of reducing Stress, but at the risk of pulling you away from the Franchise's interests?)<br/><br/>That seems like it could be an interesting tension to build into the game.<br/><br/>Rickard,<br/><br/>That tip about balancing Stress against the Franchise dice level is great!

One game with 15 Franchise dice takes about 45 minutes to play, including game pitch and character creation. (Noteworthy is that convention visitors haven't seen Ghostbusters nowadays.)<br/><br/>I tend to keep it in mind how much damage the whole "party" has taken, which makes it an uncertainty of how many Franchise dice they actually will end up with. I'm including used company dice as damage too, but those dice are rarely used unless I constantly remind them of it.<br/><br/>My groups normally wants to play the game twice, so I go easy on them first and then throwing them into real danger the second game, often so they loose Franchise Dice.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>When it comes to ending, I tend to tell them to wrap it up when I see that they got 4-5 Franchise dice left.<br/><br/>I tend to let them have about 7-10 dice left to earn during the last "act" (the field work).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Some more things I like about the game.<br/>- The structure of the game, with its four act structure, makes it super easy to improvise.<br/>- The chart for making missions. Another thing I would keep in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450315/#Comment_450315" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-04T20:50:53+00:00" title="January  4, 2016  8:50PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have forgotten a lot of the details of this game.

InSpectres is one of my all-time favorite games, and I think it works very well as written. There are some things I don't use in play, and that I would cut if I made a personal remake:<br/><br/>* Cut confessionals. I know some people think this is the best part of the game, its unique proposition, but I don't feel the need for the meta layer. I think the game is great when played straight, and I don't bother with explaining if there's a camera crew following the characters or not. I've tried using confessionals with a separate chair, but I didn't think they added enough to warrant the hassle of explaining them.<br/><br/>* Cut weird PC templates (vampires, werewolves, etc). Since I haven't used them, I assume that they work in play because the rest of the game works, but I've always had basic human PCs.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I read the game, but I'm pretty sure it says that it's more fun if you have normal people that are affected by weird stuff. I would like to add a discussion in the text on how to incorporate different visions into the same story, for example if a player is more out there than the rest of the group.<br/><br/>At a convention game I ran one player was not in sync with the rest of the group. When he realized he had the chance to describe things when he succeeded, he started describing how his gun shot multiple missiles, and how he jumped on top of these flying missiles to get to where he wanted, very animesque and totally not fitting with the theme up to that point. He was very enthusiastic, but it would have been nice to have some help with how to handle that.<br/><br/>I had another game that was fully realistic, until a player decided that someone was inflated like a balloon. The rest of the group used that (the character floated to the ceiling and avoided a werewolf attack), but the player said afterwards that he regretted introducing it because it changed the game into a cartoon. I got the impression from the game text that the player has full freedom to decide what happens, but perhaps add something on how it has to be accepted by the group and that it's OK to redact stuff if it doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Perhaps this just has to be accepted when you invite each participant to greatly affect a story, like in improvised theater. Sometimes a scene doesn't work in impro, you discuss it afterwards and try to do better next time. Perhaps you have a bad game because someone gets inflated, so you don't do that next time. Adding checks as part of the conflict resolution to prevent it risk stifling creativity, so it has to be very delicately added. I have no good answer. I can already hear people reading this saying "So talk about it at the table, what's the big deal?", but the deal is how protected each player's right is to have their own content added on a successful roll.<br/><br/>Both me and players have had trouble to explain how bonus dice from, for example, gym and bank cards work. Do you describe a short Rocky-style training montage each time you use a gym dice, do you say "I've worked out a lot, so now I add a dice when I jump across this chasm", or do you just use the dice with no explanation? It's not obvious what's expected from the group, so perhaps some better explanations there.<br/><br/>I like the story seed generator table in the game, and don't feel the ned to add any more of this. I don't want a table to determine what really is going on, because I don't know as GM. All this come from the players when they earn franchise dice in my games, as GM I just add obstacles and complications.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459660/#Comment_459660" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-27T19:12:08+00:00" title="January 27, 2017  7:12PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Jonas! Thank you. I agree with you on your thoughts re: "weird" characters, and your case against Confessionals makes some sense, as well. I guess you didn't find the "character traits" (handed out via Confessionals) to be an important part of the game?<br/><br/>What are your thoughts on the use of Stress dice? That part seems simultaneously very hand-wavey ("throw some in when you feel like it!") and absolutely critical to running the game (with the potential, for instance, to destroy the entire franchise), which is intimidating to a first-time Inspectres GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459768/#Comment_459768" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-31T12:54:03+00:00" title="January 31, 2017 12:54PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In general, people I've played with don't like to assign traits to other PCs. A player character is viewed as the sole property of the player, and any infringement on the vision for the character is treated with suspicion. Contrast this with my impro theater groups, where it's not only encouraged but expected that you help create the other character. To give the other character a trait is to give the actor a gift; you're basically doing their job for them. If you say "Where have you hidden the booze? I know you never meet your grand kids sober!" you've made them into an alcoholic, and the other actor is instructed to accept that. In my RPG groups, this would just as likely be met with "WHAT?! No, my character would never do that!" with the game grinding to a halt. I think that traits are fantastic, but I've never had a player use them. It has to be said, that InSpectres is written so that traits are a carrot, if you use them you get more franchise dice, but you can also ignore them if they don't fit your character.<br/><br/>The only problem I've had with franchise dice is with the suggestion to start with 1d6 stress rolls. It's logical as a way of testing the waters, but if the lowest stress die is 6 the PC gets a cool die to ignore the lowest of future stress dice. As soon as a PC gets a cool die, they are basically immune to future stress and get to ignore that part of the game. They are also more likely to earn more cool from future rolls since they get to ignore lower dice.<br/><br/>I've only played InSpectres as oneshots, and I'm sure that the game gets even better after multiple sessions. There's no real discussion on investing franchise dice into the business or send people on vacation after a oneshot session, which I've missed. I think that cool dice evens out in the long run, and they perfectly emulate Bill Murray's character in Ghostbusters. Also, you don't know beforehand which PC will turn out to be cool, since it's random, which can lead to funny situations. I'm bothered by the "inverted death spiral" of cool dice, but I still like them, so I can't say that the game would be improved if they are changed!<br/><br/>I haven't had trouble calling for stress rolls. I usually use them when a conflict roll indicates that the GM decides what happens, especially on a 1 result, but sometimes it's like a sanity check when the PCs see something from the other side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459773/#Comment_459773" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-31T16:45:59+00:00" title="January 31, 2017  4:45PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2017 4:10PM by Rickard.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I misread the rules, and had the players pay Cool to ignore the highest outcome of a stress roll.

(Except potentially even more important, since Stress also affects the characters' effectiveness, leading to vicious or virtuous spirals.)<br/><br/>My guess is that this could be better handled, to help GMs run the game. For instance, the advice to try to hand out roughly as much Stress as Franchise dice is useful.<br/><br/>The amount of Stress handed out could act as some kind of "gauge" for the GM to introduce more or less supernatural or scary material, as well. Maybe a stack of Stress dice which guide the GM to introduce more or less supernatural material, depending on how high it is relative to Franchise dice earned? This could help with pacing and the introduction or discovery of supernatural elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
