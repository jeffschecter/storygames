Is there an amount of games, a frequency of playing them, and/or a degree of variety in the games one plays below which one is likely to suffer in terms of design competence and, if so, what can or should one do about this? I confess that design prolixity is a particular failing of mine, but I just can't seem to stop.

My recommendations for variety would include highly social and/or creative party games as well as unusual RPGs.  <br/><br/>The bases I'd try to cover would include:<br/>- one-shot/campaign<br/>- established setting/improvised setting<br/>- character teams/separate characters<br/>- small group/large group<br/>- stable group/shifting group<br/>- face-to-face/play-by-post<br/>- GMful/"just play my guy"<br/>- GM runs the event/GM lays back<br/>- lite/crunchy<br/>- dice or cards used constantly/never<br/>- minute task resolution/scene resolution<br/>- rules-focused/fiction-focused<br/>- competitive/collaborative<br/>- immersive/removed<br/>- intense/silly<br/>- acting/no acting<br/>- zoomed in/zoomed out<br/>- pervasive talking rules/not<br/>- freeform/scripted<br/>- open-ended/act-structured<br/><br/>These 20 items represent more than 20 options; each is essentially a spectrum.

The OPs point seems more to the effect of whether playing infrequently will make you a worse designer than you'd be otherwise. I think if you are not playing games that much, it is definitely going to impact your design in a negative way, because you are not dealing with the practical aspects and problems of play as much. It is like when you design a mechanic and it is great on paper, then you actually run the thing and it falls apart because you weren't considering the things that can come up at the table (or it didn't play how you imagined it, so you tweak it). I don't think you necessarily have to play a bunch of different games. But at the very least, if you are not playing the systems you are designing for (whether it is your own system or another), that is going to hurt your design (and it definitely helps to see how other systems do things). I just don't think one can understand what the needs of players and GMs are at the table if your barely playing games yourself. And you are definitely going to have a hard time talking about how to apply your games in live play if you are barely playing them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451015/#Comment_451015" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-31T19:18:37+00:00" title="January 31, 2016  7:18PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2016 7:21PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed on those points, Brendan.<br/><br/>I think some of that is inherently covered by playtesting, which Catty didn't ask about, so I assume he's at least doing that.

These are games that aren't revolutionary in any way, but combine techniques that I know work and I can reliably imagine how they will synergize at the table.<br/><br/>Then I have crazy ideas that are unlike techniques I've used before, and in those cases playtesting is essential, of course. Often it doesn't work the way I intended, but sometimes playtesting will reveal other neat stuff that I couldn't figure out on my own.<br/><br/>Finally, reading and playing other people's games does a lot to give me inspiration, which fuels me to keep going. I often play a game and think "Ooh, I want to make a game about this!" (because I rarely find games that I don't think I could do better myself.

From all the games I've readed in the Forge and in SG, I think I have only actually played Kingdom... and a bit hacked version of 3:16. The rest of them all, I played heavily hacked versions or made a trad design and fitted mechanics from every other game I found interesting.<br/><br/>Did that made me a better designer? Well, it's as Simon wrote above, it's quite clear now that my designs are more enjoyable now than they were a few years ago. Now I've got an idea of how making a certain kind of design fun, but I can't certainly make the same with every genre of game. That's because I focused on things I like but that my group of players would also like to play. <br/><br/>It works for me, I have fun this way but I wouldn't consider myself a professional game designer. For that I should be able, I think, to take on anything and turn it into an enjoyable/profitable game. And I reckon that would be only accomplishable by analyzing other people's games and my own as a read, in abstract and in play to find out what they generate in the players and how.<br/><br/>But that's not my goal, I just want to design a particular kind of games in a particular way, so I just focus on what I like and that's it. I do research as much as I can and playtest, as well as discuss ideas here and with some friends. That certainly helps a lot. There are however a few concepts and mechanics I've found that can only be understood when played as they sound terribly complex or silly when explained.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts" title="Hybridartifacts"><img alt="Hybridartifacts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts">Hybridartifacts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451037/#Comment_451037" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-01T18:45:30+00:00" title="February  1, 2016  6:45PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its an issue thats been bugging me as well. Mostly because its next to impossible for me to actually get a game group together for a game at the moment. <br/><br/>I tend to go through periods where I play a lot and others when I hardly play at all - well, ok, mostly referee, I'm a nightmare to have as a player because having refereed for around 38 years I can usually work out the entire structure of the adventure within the first ten minutes and have already established how to complete the whole thing in ten more, which for some reason other referees don't usually appreciate. I do the same with films and TV shows (some of us might conclude people write to a common formula...). Bad habit.<br/><br/>Thats a bit of a round about way to my point - its not always necessary to be playing but it helps to have played in the past - a lot. What playing still does is it can keep you fresh and up to date. I have always noticed that after one of my not playing much phases that I realise I have got a bit out of date on interesting things that have been happening in game design. Having a finger on the pulse can be a good thing (at least you know if you are being innovative and maybe taking a risk or two or firmly in peoples comfort zone even though you thought you were being innovative and risky). Of course you can get much of that from simply reading new rpgs. There is a point where you have played so much you can a good feel for how a game will play just from reading it. <br/><br/>Here is the big issue though - the one game you probably should not assume you can get a good feel for how it will play from past experience is your own. We can all get creative blind spots with our own projects and its all too easy to over-own them, to become a bit myopic about your own games possible weaknesses. That can actually be true of any creative project. Other people playing your game (and giving you feedback or you watching them play) is more important than you playing other peoples games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451046/#Comment_451046" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-01T22:25:28+00:00" title="February  1, 2016 10:25PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My advice is to approach play like a carrion-eating bird approaches roadkill - delight in everything you can get your talons on with an open mind and open heart.

In terms of reading and playing other games in the same ballpark (i.e. you are working on a Steampunk Game, so you go out and play all the major Steam Punk RPGS), I can go either way there. Sometimes I like to shut myself out from all influence of similar games until I'm basically done designing, sometimes I like to see what others have done and find where I can add something new. <br/><br/>But to me, the big thing is play what you are designing. Play it before you write anything down, develop it, play it while you are writing. Play it when you're done. Keep playing it. And play it in regular, long term campaigns (unless it is a micro game or something where long term use isn't an expectation). It is laudable to have a vision or overarching goal, but at the same time, people are going to play this thing and the purpose of it is to have a game they'll enjoy. I find the realities of what kinds of challenges and problems are actually encountered at the table usually trump whatever big ideas I had going in. I like my mechanics to reflect how I am actually playing the system myself with a live group. If it isn't happening fairly regularly in my own personal campaign for it, I don't really want it ending up in print. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451099/#Comment_451099" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T06:57:15+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  6:57AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2016 7:01AM by BeePeeGee.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the main reason why I've posted this: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20507/my-new-year-resolution-more-play-less-design" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20507/my-new-year-resolution-more-play-less-design</a><br/><br/>You can indeed dry up as a designer if you don't play enough, I think.<br/><br/>Some more thoughts for a game designer:<br/><br/>1. In general, it is better to aim for <i>variety rather than depth</i>. Playing 10 one-shots of different systems is usually more beneficial than a loong campaign in one game system.<br/><br/>2. In general, you'll probably learn more as a <i>GM rather than as a player</i>. GM thinking is closer to game design than player thinking.<br/><br/>3. Play your games, <i>play your games</i>, play your games. You should be passionate about them, you should get your players excited about your games and the experience should be fun.<br/><br/>4. It's not how many games you play, it's that you <i>play with the mindset of a designer</i>. Take apart each game's mechanics, reflect the gaming experience, think of possible hacks, think of another setting for the system, think of another system for the setting, try out differet hacks, cross-breed details from different games, take notes...<br/><br/>5. Have an <i>intimate group of roleplaying buddies</i> who are open and available to try your newest ideas and are giving you honest &amp; useful feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451112/#Comment_451112" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T16:02:39+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  4:02PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think something that pretty much everyone can agree on (and not even really related to the question posted by the OP, and certainly not intended by my initial introductory comment) is that we should play our own games. Playtesting is an integral part of the design process - you'd be hard pressed to convince me otherwise.<br/><br/>What I was referring to was playing <i>other</i> games, ones in which I didn't have a direct hand in designing. I playtest my own stuff about four times a week, not to mention all of the play by post games I'm involved in. But, I rarely <i>play</i> other games - I read them, analyze them, pick them apart, but I maybe play an "outside" game once every few months, if that. <br/><br/>So, to restate the intent of my initial comment and, I think, the intent of the OP:<br/><br/>Do you think that playing other games, outside of your own design and playtesting process, is important for being a game designer? I'd say so. While there is certainly some creative cross-contamination that can happen, I'm of the mind that the more exposure you get in any field (game design or otherwise) the more likely you are to execute something well.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451114/#Comment_451114" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T16:15:32+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  4:15PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2016 4:15PM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's right bendutter; in my 26 years of experience as a comic artist, at first I went through the stage of copying other authors, then developing a mix of traits I liked from them and then turning those into my own.

I'll give you that perhaps this is just me, I do got the theory but seeing it in practice reveals a lot more to me about how to apply it. I wouldn't be able to say how much people in the RPG field would do the opposite better, learn first the basics through theory books and then practice until mastering game design. Not that there isn't any people like this, but perhaps there should be more.\n<blockquote><br/>I see what you're getting at, but this is a problem I see with "fantasy heartbreakers", or at least people's definition of it.

It happens in the field of comics everywhere too. Here in my country a lot of newcomers plagiarize concepts, graphic style, characters and/or scenes from whatever commercial popular stuff is out there. In U.S.A. I once received a propossal to draw a character whose description matched Ghostrider's. I couldn't believe it, and when I asked about the resemblance the dude said that "there was enough space for characters like these on the market". I politely declined the gig, but I was thankful we talked this through e-mails instead of face to face, otherwise seeing me rolling on the floor would have tipped the guy about my opinions on his "original character".<br/><br/>I often refer this case and others to newcomers whenever I give classes about comics. And then I ask them to read and experience as many different things as possible, from comics to books, movies, theater, videogames and better yet, real life, to expand their mental library of reference material so readers don't notice the source of their creations.<br/><br/>I dunno if we should/could apply this to game design to reduce the amount of/rise the quality of heartbreakers. I consider them a learning stage, though it'd work better if these games were way shorter (as it did for me a lot of finally put the words "the end" on a short comming) or if we should have more people reading theory games before designing anything, but it's a lot easier and people will find it more justifiable if we tell them to play a lot of games so they can learn from them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451205/#Comment_451205" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-08T22:04:04+00:00" title="February  8, 2016 10:04PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leo, next time I manage a game in Kent with Dana &amp; Giles do you want to show up? It's likely to be Giles running a Deadlands hack for Middle Earth, or it could be anyone running the <b>Implosion!</b> Tabletop RPG. <br/><br/>If your games are very simple mechanically, you may not learn a lot about the mechanical side of things from seeing them in playtest. On the other hand, if they are of even moderate complexity, you may be surprised how many curved balls the experience of actual play throws at you, and how many bogies you find, maybe bogies with easy fixes but bogies nonetheless. Even after tons of playtesting of Soul's Calling for instance, I was still learning about it throughout the campaign I ran in 2014-2015, not just about the a-reffing aspect (where it was really an eye-opener) but about all sorts of things. I ended up rewriting the fate subsystem twice in the course of the one campaign.<br/><br/>Partly it's that running the game in actual situations that other people have contributed to and driven forces you to think things through much more rigorously, and makes you notice all sorts of edge cases that you may not have anticipated.<br/><br/>As for breadth of ideas, and evaluation of how mechanics feed into play-speed, atmosphere etc., and seeing how to maximise the impact of people's soft skills in play, I would think that those are fertile areas to learn from play.<br/><br/>Personally I would never dream of trying to sell a product as a commercial product without having played it or run it first; I would consider that unethical. And I would think it arrogant for someone to think they could design roleplaying games without ever having played or GMed them, or with minimal experience. Of course, there could be geniuses out there who are justly confident to that point, but if they opened their mouths to make that claim, nobody with common sense would take them at their word. On the other hand I don't think you need to play every day or every week or even necessarily every month to keep up your skills. But you (the impersonal you) would probably benefit from at least getting in some periods of intense playing / GMing experience. Ideally you should experience both GMing and playing, get your players' feedback when you GM, and get feedback from groups that you've not been part of too, but the most important part of that is GMing your own games. Playing other people's games is also a good thing to help broaden your perspectives and give you inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451241/#Comment_451241" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-10T21:41:44+00:00" title="February 10, 2016  9:41PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2016 9:42PM by catty_big.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Matt, good to see you here.
