I watched <a href="http://www.lovehkfilm.com/panasia/host.htm" rel="nofollow">the Host</a> (actually quite a nice little contemporary monster flick) recently with Eppy and he commented on one of the characters being a type he enjoys: the person who throws themselves into the fray late in the game for no discernable reason but the pure joy of it, or orneriness. The homeless fellow who helps the brother of the main character who uses a can of gasoline to good effect in the climactic battle. However, that sounds unlike someone who <b>does</b> have something at stake. Quite the contrary.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120987/#Comment_120987" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T11:33:43+00:00" title="January 21, 2008 11:33AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 1of3</cite>Tony, you're post is quite abstract. Could you give an example from such a genre?</blockquote>In <i>Ranma 1/2</i>, for example, the shoujo structure is wedded to very shonen, very explicit conflicts:  to wit, Ranma always wants to get into martial arts fights.  But these fights, on their own, <i>do not matter</i>.  If he wins?  Great.  He reinforces his notion that he's the toughest and the strongest.  If he loses?  Doesn't matter.  He makes up some excuse for why he lost, and reinforces his notion that he's the toughest and the strongest.<br><br/>Despite all his bluster, Ranma <i>has no stakes</i> in the fights he starts.<br/><br/>Often, though, bystanders have heavy stakes in the fight.  Most of the time it's fairly blatant "Akane will date/marry/clean-the-house-of me, your adversary, unless you can defeat me in battle!", though the formula is applied to many different stakes-holders, broadly and with gusto, episode after episode after episode.<br/><br/>So there's a situation where, for instance, you have three participants in the fight:  Ranma and Kuno fighting <i>over</i> Akane.  How does Akane's role work?  How much control does she have over how big the stakes are to her?  If she gets to say (for instance) "No, it's no big deal ... if Kuno wants to go out with me that bad, I don't really mind," how does that impact both Kuno and Ranma, and what they get out of the fight?  If, contrariwise she says (as she often does) "DEATH FIRST!" then how does <b>that</b> impact Kuno and Ranma?<br/><br/>And then, of course, abstract that back into less explicit conflicts:  If Eddie is being convinced to go to the dance with Veronica, but Rachel's really the one with stakes in the conflict (not that SHE wants to go with Eddie ... that would be wierd, they're-just-friends, but ... but ... he's <i>better</i> than that bitch Veronica) then how does that conflict play out?                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121725/#Comment_121725" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T12:40:19+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 12:40PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike S,<br/><br/>It sounds like multiple people could each have one or more of those three roles. I read it as saying: Everyone is a protagonist, an antagonist, and/or someone with something at stake.<br/><br/><br/>So Thunderman is fighting an epic duel with Dr. Sin, and Ellen Mincy's life hangs in the balance. And the Nameless Crowd also have a huge stake in the fight. And Goonboy, the rival superhero who despises Thunderman, also has a stake in the fight between Thunderman and Dr. Sin.<br/><br/>But Goonboy and Thunderman are also fighting, in an undercut-the-other-hero way, and Dr. Sin has a stake in that fight (he is trying to help Goonboy win, because Goonboy is the lesser threat to him).<br/><br/>And Ellen Mincy is a political activist who is struggling to get President Rupert impeached. And so she's fighting a fight against the Nameless Crowd, and President Rupert has something at stake in that fight.<br/><br/>And President Rupert is fighting the Nameless Crowd for their ongoing loyalty as his first Presidential term nears an end and he looks to run again, and he has a stake in his own fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121745/#Comment_121745" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T13:41:53+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  1:41PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes total sense.<br/><br/>Can you say more about the fiction this emulates, to your way of thinking?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
