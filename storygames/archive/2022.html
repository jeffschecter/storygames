                    So weâ€™re all familiar with the overpowered badguys that kill the whole party, and weâ€™re familiar with the pushover badguys that donâ€™t even make the party break a sweat.  In the tactical world, itâ€™s an easy thing to identify unfit opposition and a relatively straightforward matter to create fit opposition â€“ itâ€™s often just a matter of numbers.<br/><br/>However, once we leave the tactical world and step into the thematic world, itâ€™s far more difficult to come up with â€œfit oppositionâ€ of a thematic bent, that will not only interest the players, but will engage them in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>Consider: youâ€™re running a game* for a paladin in the service of holy ideals.  Youâ€™re prepping an adventure.  You have three options:<br/>a) killing trolls in a dungeon<br/>b) recovering holy artifacts sacred to the paladinâ€™s order<br/>c) defending a village from an infiltrator of the demon-worshipping Global Evil Cult<br/>d) uprooting corruption in the paladinâ€™s holy order<br/><br/><small>* Note that this discussion is applicable outside of GMing as well, but itâ€™s easier to frame as within the context of the GM role.</small><br/><br/>Now, most everybody, Iâ€™m hoping, can see that (a) is probably the worst option for thematically engaging play.  However, the thing that gets me is that, depending on the paladin character and player, options (b), (c), and (d) are not equal â€“ one of them would be better received than the other two.  I have very few tools available to me to distinguish between the latter three options.<br/><br/>One step deeper: thereâ€™s also the question of how much and in what way you might push each one of those scenarios.  Is the corruption in the order just a far-flung group of heretics that needs to be wiped out, or is it the paladinâ€™s mentor whoâ€™s trying to recruit him, or his lover, or his son?<br/><br/>Iâ€™ve done some blind groping about this in <em>FLFS</em>, which mostly just ripped off Town Creation from <em>Dogs</em>.  Thereâ€™s got to be more techniques and methods out there, though.<br/><br/>So I put it to the wise voices of Story Games: what tricks and techniques have you found to properly calibrate thematic opposition?                </div>

                            Hey Josh,<br/><br/>I'm not sure you're going to like my answer to this question.  One day I was preping for an upcoming session of 7th Sea.  The game had been floundering.  Despite using every technique in my arsenal at the time nothing was sticking.  Then I had a bit of revelation.  I completely threw the characters out the window.  Totally forgot about them.  Then I made a list of my players and the things I know they care about.  Then retooled the existing elements of my 7th Sea game to more or less threaten those things.  Worked like a charm.  Still works to this day.<br/><br/>Now, I know from out discussions and reading your game that you're all about "what interests the player."  But I still get the impression that there's still this filter of, "what interests the player about this character or that element of the setting."  I toss the filter out completely.  I go for what the player REALLY cares about themselves, right here, in the real world.  I leave the filting of, "as expressed through this character" entirely in the hands of the player.<br/><br/>The thing is I'm not particularly vicious about it.  In some ways I wish I were MORE vicious about it but I'm too much of a softy deep down.  It also runs the risk of getting repetative because I can go for the guaranteed engagement (i.e. the family issues with my wife) or I can try an angle I haven't tried before.  I usually go guaranteed.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure there's a procedural, mechanical or design way to get this dynamic in action.  Doesn't Ron's Spione thing use "real world" transgressions as part of it's setup?  That's about the only route I can think of.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

Joshua, <br/><br/>Seems to me that this is what flags during chargen, hopefully put down on the character sheet for me to construct the adventure so that it is engaging to the player.<br/><br/>Right?<br/><br/>Am I over-simplifying this?                        </div>

                            Jesse --<br/>That's the sort of thing that I'm after, actually.  The question is how you fine-tune "family issues" to make sure it's the family issues that your wife will engage with.  As far as the player/character divide, I usually consider the character to be a means by which the player can communicate the issues that they're interested in <em>right now</em>.  I'm playing the Power of Ideology and Martyrs in Nobilis right now, but I don't want every game I play to be about hardcore ideology.  Our PTA game, for instance, has little-to-no ideology for my character Nicholas, which is fine because he's all about responsibility and family tradition, which is what I'm interested in there.<br/><br/>Judd --<br/>You're oversimplifying, but flags are certainly part of it.  Flags are the bulls-eye.  I'm asking about the aiming.  How do I take a character sheet and a conversation with a player and turn that input into a situation that will engage them?<br/><br/>Shreyas --<br/>Yes, but I want <strong>more!</strong> <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

I think that in order for this to make any kind of damned sense we need to have concrete examples, either setting up a game that will never be and examining the flag inspired set up <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2003/12/campaign_prepar.html" rel="nofollow">Art Deco Melodrama</a> style or putting up character sheets from games we are playing or have played and how we tapped into their flags.<br/><br/>To go back to your first post:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>So I put it to the wise voices of Story Games: what tricks and techniques have you found to properly calibrate thematic opposition?</blockquote>
I let the game be inspired by the character sheet.  Surprises spring from it and if chargen was mediated well, the drama flows like Spice from a sandworm.<br/><br/>But again, I'm over-simplifying and don't know where to go with this.<br/><br/>Is anyone interested in setting up a faux game set-up thread where I'll play GM, facilitate chargen and then go through the finished characters in order to show what I'd do with the flags?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I go for what the player REALLY cares about themselves, right here, in the real world.</blockquote>
Apart from the "I don't know you too well" problem, I see the benign "rubber duck collection" problem: what if there are other issues a player you do know well would like to see without knowing it.  Instead they get the one issue they reacted really well to over and over again.<br/><br/>Actually, two more issues with this approach: there's a phenomenon I've noticed in some couples (which I am not ascribing to you and Meghan) where they become very insular, and form a kind of culture of two.  The pathological form of playing to a well-known player's issues would be the same kind of insular culture, at least as regards what makes a good story.  <br/><br/>Finally, it assumes more of an authorship role than is fair without discussion.  There's the implicit assumption (not necessarily a wrong one, but not always right, either) that the GM needs to present a situation purely for the interest of the players.  It's as valid to suggest that the players should have  some influence over the situation in order to engage each other and the GM, or themselves.<br/><br/>None of these objections are particularly damning, but do seem like immediate consequences of the player-hook pattern, of which the implementor should be aware, neh?                        </div>

                            Mo beat me to my question -- I think it's interesting that when people talk about tactical opposition there's almost always mention of the danger of an accidental TPK or overwhelming the players, but so far the talk in this thread is all about making sure you can create appropriate opposition at all.<br/><br/>I think there's a real danger of going over the top in a few ways:<br/><br/>1) Too much, too soon. It's easy to get excited when you see a flag or someone explicitly tells you what they want, and then suddenly you're like 'oh so you like dogs? okay then a talking dog comes into your room and you're dreaming about a dog but when you go outside everyone is a dog and omg you ran over a dog on the way to work!' And sure, they liked dogs, but maybe that was only one thing they liked. Or maybe they didn't like dogs that much.<br/>Or, more along 'too soon' lines, maybe it all would have worked out better if you had taken the whole dog theme slowly, building in references and slowly adding tension, coming at it from different angles in a thoughtful, rather than all-at-once way.<br/><br/>2) Okay, I like ice cream... but on a bagel? Sometimes you might identify the right kind of theme, in the sense of topic or content, but that's not the same thing as figuring out just how important the player wants that theme to be to overall play. It may be the case that my character, thematically, is all about concepts of revenge, but that doesn't necessarily mean I want every scene in the game to be about revenge. Some people like constant, weighty symbolism and endless capital-S situations -- other people prefer these things to drift under the surface, rarely coming up explicitly.<br/><br/>It seems like understanding what kind of thematic opposition to bring is only the beginning -- understanding <i>how to deliver that opposition</i> and how strong to bring it are also important steps.                        </div>

                            So frequency, quality, and intensity.<br/><br/>For frequency: we all know what it's like to have a giant flag up and flying and having it never make it into the story, and like Daniel says, there are times when hitting the flag often is too much. How do we calibrate what's right?<br/><br/>For quality: we need, like Daniel said, an appropriateness to the kind of thematic hit we're wielding. It needs not just to hit the theme, but to hit the theme in the place the player needs it hit to pay off. We also, I would add, need the hit to have appropriate contextualization. If I have a theme of betrayal, and the betrayal that comes up doesn't fit the story, then it's not going to be effective cause it will feel tacked on. How do we calibrate quality?<br/><br/>For intensity: Not only does the hit need appropriate contextualization, but it needs appropriate proximity and intensity too. If the theme is betrayal, and the minor NPC who owns the convenience store down the block, who doesn't have any kind of thematic or emotional tie to the PC has his brother shoot him in the back, it won't have the kind of intensity than if it were the PC's brother. Both might be appropriate in certain situations. How to calibrate intensity?<br/><br/>I'd also say that maybe scale is an issue: If you're in a long running campaign, and you don't wish to swap out  your themes, but instead to do a long exploration of them, then the scale of your hits will likely be different than if this is a one shot hard hitting statement of a game. Scale is relevant to the amount of escalation that you want. How to calibrate it?<br/><br/>Is there other aspects we should be looking at?                        </div>

<p>One metric I have found seems to work okay is the player's choice to engage.</p>
<p>If you throw an enticingly thematic conflict at him, and it's not too frequent, then he will engage with it happily.</p>
<p>If he's like me, he'll keep engaging in conflicts after they've become too frequent, because, like, they <em>matter</em> right, but with increasing frustration. The frustration tells you when to stop.</p>
<p>This isn't a very <em>good</em> meter, though, since it only notifies you <em>after</em> you've gone and done the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Well, that depends on the content of the conflicts. If I simply <em>cannot accept</em> a particular outcome, then I will fight on even if I've stopped having fun.</p>
<p>Which I guess is a way of saying, there's more than one dimension of interest.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about appropriateness of opposition a little, and I am thinking that, for me, appropriate opposition is such that the character and opposer can <em>reasonably resist each other</em> on the theme's playing field, but aren't identical, 'cause that's boring.</p>
<p>So, suppose that we have my character, call him Will, he's the captain of the high school football team, and he trusts <em>everybody</em> because he's pretty much one of the most influential kids in his grade.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that we have Martin, who's on the lacrosse team, and he wants to do something awful to Will. Martin is popular, but he's no football captain.</p>
<p>Martin can't oppose Will on the field of betrayal, because Will is pretty much perfectly secure there; Martin's influence is just not strong enough. But, maybe he can engage him on the field of social position - Will probably topples if he loses his captainship, and Martin tutors him in calculus... Will can probably resist this by, like, developing real friendships that'll support him when he doesn't have a social badge, but he's being attacked on academic terms.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure this is what you're looking for, Mo, 'cause I have felt like for most of this thread you've been talking about "thematic stuff" and not necessarily about <em>opposition,</em> but maybe it sheds some light anyway.</p>

                            I'm also starting to wonder if the 'opposition' part of the term is just a carryover from the previous thread. I suggest proof by opposition: can anyone describe something they would call 'thematic support' or 'thematic help'?<br/><br/>I mean on the one hand you can talk about making sure that whatever opposition (in the sense of actions and goals) someone comes up against is relevant to their themes -- that's mostly what people have been talking about, and possibly what everyone has been talking about. But is there some other sense in which a theme can oppose a character? I don't want to derail this thread with semantics, because I strongly suspect that everyone has just been talking about the above meaning, in which case we should keep talking about it. But maybe there are also fruitful things to say about introducing different themes that 'oppose' (contrast, call into question) the themes of a character.                        </div>

In games of story, we're usually talking about theme as the product of choices. Do you choose family over friends? Do you fight even though you might die? That sort of stuff. But theme is also about the evaluation of those choices. Is it good to choose family over friends? How does the game help the players to make those value judgments?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm kinda repeating what everyone is saying here, but putting it in my own words helps a bit. The game itself can't answer the question, and it can't hardly suggest what's right and wrong. But it can provide cues and prompts. I think in terms of "what's right" a good theme needs time to develop, and the player needs to make the evaluation based ideally on multiple choices, not just one momentous event.<br/><br/>So in play, I like a scene where thematic elements can be present, and they can kind of be simmering, and the results of conflict (including my choices) may or may not turn up the heat on any given thematic element.<br/><br/>Like if a game is about duty and relationships, it doesn't have to be "OMG WHICH WILL YOU CHOOSE" at every turn. Instead, a conflict can evaluate the various elements individually. How do you feel about this relationship? How do you feel about duty? Once you get a sense of individual value, then you can mix them up.<br/><br/>Here's maybe a better example. Suppose in a game there's a conflict about how far you'll go to follow orders, but it's a self contained conflict. It's about you. Will you risk your life? A broken finger? What? Then there's another conflict about how far you'll go to preserve a friendship. Later, you can combine the two. Will you risk your friendship to follow orders? Will you risk your career to save your friend? But you need to establish the value of each individually in order to set up that latter conflict. If the relationship is crap, then it's lame to stake the character's career on it, but you might risk something smaller, like maybe missing out on an opportunity.<br/><br/>Is that on track with what you're asking? Not that I expect anyone to read all that. Holy crap, what a windbag I am.                        </div>

                            (Matt, in all the lands of RPG internet disucssions, there is no wind-bag windier and baggier than I!)<br/>
<br/>
Hi Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm a little confused.<br/>
<br/>
1) I'm not sure what "thematic opposition" means. As others have noted, the thematic content is created by the choices the Player makes for the character.<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean, "How does the GM know which conflicts will put in front of the Player that demand choices for the Player cares about?" (I think this is issue you're hunting down, but I'm not sure.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) As of now, you haven't named a specific game. But specific games have tools to handle this matter in different ways. So I'm not sure yet how to even address this matter specifically.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) When you wrote, "Consider: youâ€™re running a game* for a paladin in the service of holy ideals. Youâ€™re prepping an adventure," my first reaction was, "Preparing an adventure? People still do that?" (Yes, Ron sends me a gallon of Kook-Aid for my water-cooler every month!)<br/>
<br/>
I mean, wouldn't the player who's playing the Paladin <i>tell</i> you what sort of adventure he wanted?<br/>
<br/>
And if not, why not? (Which brings us back to what is the system, because different systems have different, effective ways, of handling this.)<br/>
<br/>
Because I thought of five ways killing trolls would be thematically sound for the paladin in a few seconds: they are discovered to be converts to Paladins faith but the Duke wantts them dead; they know a truth that shakes the foundation of the Paladin's faith; and so on...<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this implies Player choices (covered below), but I'm assuming that sort of game from your post.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, who creates these facts, what sort of game it is, all these things are influenced by the actual rules.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that in the other three choices, there's really no "thematic opposition."<br/>
<br/>
<i><b>b) recovering holy artifacts sacred to the paladinâ€™s order<br/>
c) defending a village from an infiltrator of the demon-worshipping Global Evil Cult<br/>
d) uprooting corruption in the paladinâ€™s holy order</b></i><br/>
<br/>
Each of these three <i>tasks<b></b></i> might be more appropriate for the Paladin if I were to look over his resume and ask him about his interests in life. But there's nothing <i>yet</i> thematically conflicted about this stuff. (In fact, it all seems rather straight-forward.)<br/>
<br/>
So, again, I'm a little uncertain as to what you're going after.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4) And then, in your response to Jesse, you wrote, "That's the sort of thing that I'm after, actually. The question is how you fine-tune 'family issues' to make sure it's the family issues that your wife will engage with."<br/>
<br/>
Okay, but are we're talking about engaging at the "scene level" or the "preparing the adventure level" because there are different techniques you'll be using in actually playing a game. Now, you may say, "Well, I mean both the preparing level and the scene level." Which is cool. But I still need to know what game we're playing, because how <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> handles this on the prep and scene level is different than how <i>Primetime Adventures</i> handles these matters on the prep and scene level, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5) Let me say finally...<br/>
<br/>
One thing I think everyone misses the boat on is that at some point for these kinds of games, the rules end and you're stuck with aesthetics and intuition. These are skills that can be developed, but at a base level we can all have them and we can all use them.<br/>
<br/>
For example, by does everyone blow by the Back of the Character Sheet in <i>Sorcerer</i>? Because they don't look like rules. There's no numbers attached. It's just a bunch of stuff. Yet Ron insists the Back of the Character Sheet is vital. (When games tank out of the gate and people post at The Forge about it, one of his standard questions is, "Did you guys fill out the back of the character sheet?" And we beginners always go, "Uh, no. Does that matter?"<br/>
<br/>
Well, it does. Because it's the spot where the Player gets to write down how his Lore (which should always be a loaded psycho-sexual-violent matrix of some kind that taps some nerve of some kind) meets the characters the Player has deemed important to his character, along with the Cost the use of Lore has taken on the Character and the Kicker elements, which is the central conceit that kicks the story off.<br/>
<br/>
On the back of the sheet you''re supposed to put these elements that are really vital to each other<i>near each other</i> on the character sheet.<br/>
<br/>
That's why it's important to have the full character creation session -- to tease this stuff out from each other and really keep digging down a bit as you struggle to think through, "Oh, yeah, if this is my Kicker, then I probably need a guy like this in my Character's life. And if I've got that guy, and I'm supposed to know how connected he is to more Lore...." blah, blah, blah... And you end up with all this stuff the Players have thought through and are now invested in because a) it's theirs, and b) they thought it through -- so of course they're invested in it!<br/>
<br/>
And here's the aesthetic and intuitionn part. The GM looks at the back of the sheet and -- what? There are no numbers. Nothing is prioritized. What the heck does he do with this jumble of names and places and obects and events.<br/>
<br/>
He reads it like a Tarot deck. That's my analogy, at least. You <i>feel</i> your way into this -- admittedly concrete -- cast of characters and objects and events and places. And you start drawing out what will be interesting to use and bring back and challenge the Player with for choices for the PC.<br/>
<br/>
It'd be nice if we could someone just have the Players "beam" their thematic interests into our heads and we just spit out the sweet juices... But that's not the way it works. We're left with reading the tea leaves and lookng for clues -- because no one at the table <i>fully knows</i> what they want. We intuit, and then we jigger it into reality during play.<br/>
<br/>
I went through the eleaborate bit to make two things clear: How often are we not paying attention to what we could do to find those things the Players are interested in? Admittedly, Ron sums up the back of the character sheet in two sentences in the rules (Ron, Ron, Ron...) but it IS half the character sheet and lots of people still don't use what is essentially a fuckin' <i>bullseye</i> for Player interest.<br/>
<br/>
Second, we are left always with discovering and defining this stuff in <i>play.</i> That's the point of play. That's why it's <i>Story Now.</i> It can't be all front loaded. It demands input -- full input -- from all the players in all interaction -- because in the actual moment of play are the new fictional elements defined, revealed, and held valuable or tossed aside.<br/>
<br/>
While there is a very valuable side to what you're after (I think), I'm not sure that I'm not reading a little bit of you wanting to win the fight without stepping into the ring. And, it seems, you want to protect the Players a bit -- in your desire to deliver what they want without them having to step into the ring without you.<br/>
<br/>
But my example was from <i>Sorcerer</i>. <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> does this differntly, in both form and function. As does <i>Primetime Adventures</i>. And <i>The Mountain Witch</i>. And <i>The Riddle of Steel</i>. And <i>The Burning Wheel</i>. And so on.<br/>
<br/>
So, there are dozens of ways of handling this. Are you seeking how to do this in general (which would entail then making it specific with actual rules or procedures) or discussing how you'd do this with games already in print?<br/>

                            Well, we must have hit the half-way point in the thread because we're all asking what we're asking.  What is "thematic opposition" and what do we mean when we talk about "calibrating" it?  Here's my stab:<br><br><strong>thematic opposition</strong> - the characters and circumstances thrown at a character which challenge the character to make thematic choices.<br><br>Note that the "thematic choices" do not need to always be big, hard choices, as Matt points out.  Which brings us to:<br><br><strong>callibrating thematic opposition</strong> - selecting and later modifying the characters and circumstances thrown at a character to ensure that the choices the player must make are engaging -- not only relevant, but varied, and making the choices exactly as "tough" as they need to be for the player's enjoyment (and probably the rest of the table, too)<br><br>This is a big, big concept, and describing it simply is probably impossible.  The SotC thread is probably as compact an example as is possible.<br><br>Christopher, this is that "magic" step when the GM looks at the back of the Sorcerer sheets, sees a dozen different concepts and then somehow ties them together into a nice, satisfying gordian knot for the players to poke at.  For my money, <em>Sorcerer</em> leaves the GM high and dry on how to actually make that happen; <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> took a couple steps in the right direction.  We still have only the most rudimentary described procedures for this process, whereas D&amp;D 3.5 can reliably produce satisfying <em>tactical</em> opposition by following the dungeon construction rules or whatever they're called.<br><br>ICE, there most certainly is stuff that qualifies as "thematic help" and "thematic support" -- the most prominent place it comes from is the other players.  Now often big IC talks complicate matters rather than simplify them, but take a look at the shorter IC talks, and I think you'll find a lot of them having the characters simplify choices for each other, and make things easier.  Exchanges like, "Look, Merwin.  I understand he's your brother, but you saw that village he slaughtered.  We can't just stand by and let him continue that."  The players often work as a group to unravel the choices they are presented with -- in fact that's very close to the essence of all this Story Now stuff -- and that's what I'd pin as thematic help.<br><br>The GM-figure can get in on this at times, too, and I think this is probably a piece of calibrating thematic opposition.  How many times have we had an NPC do something to be more sympathetic or more despicable, thereby making the players' choices more straightforward?<br><br>I'm not sure if I'd want to split hairs, but thematic support might even be considerd as something slightly different than thematic help.  If a character was really all about, say, duty and loyalty, the GM or another player can contextualize a situation in those terms, thereby supporting that character's theme.  Sort of like: "Look, Merwin.  I understand he's your brother, but we've been sent by the King, and by the strength of our oaths, we must stop him."<br><br>Now, one potential criticism that I see is that I'm suggesting taking the aesthetics and inspiration out of the process, but I'm really not.  We're already <em>doing</em> this, Christopher is already looking over the backs of Sorcerer sheets and coming up with situations and bangs.  Presumably he does some <em>things</em> in order to get from the bullseyes to the situation.  The question is, if we were to examine that practice and our own practices and write them down, maybe in a step-by-step list, what would it look like?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Eef. Okay. This thread is derailing I think.<br><br>Let me restate?<br><br>In the Unbreakable game I run for Brand, he plays a character a little like Bruce Willis's character in the movie in that he's a guy who has abilities just one half notch above what it means to be human. He's an immigrant living in New York, he has some political routes in communist Kerela, and one of his big themes is about the power of communities to empower themselves. So, after killing off the heads of the local gangs, he decided that he needed to do some ground up community building to help keep his block in Alphabet City (G block) clean, empowered and violence free. He declared his intention to at one point start up a kind of a neighborhood watch kind of thing.<br><br>So, the flags are up: Brand wants to move forward and develop his theme.<br><br>To that, there's a number of things involved in my role as a GM in this game.<br><br>Thematic Support: Providing the opportunity to showcase the theme. To do this, I open a scene of the neighborhood watch. <br><br>To provide Thematic Support, I bring in a good mix of characters that come to the meeting. There is a variety of ways that these characters can offer support to or fodder for the theme. A couple of women whose children have died in the gang life, a mother and daughter whose life he's saved at one point, a crusty landlord whose financial interests are in the block, a bunch of middle class white kids playing at being Bohemian in the ghetto, a gun toting take back the streets Guardian Angel militia guy, a kid who's only one step away from the gangs and has seen, with his own eyes, Arjuna mercilessly kill his gang leader, and who saw him take enough bullets to know that he's not strictly normal.<br><br>Thematic opposition: providing force or enticement that demands a change in the character's theme, or forces the character to either reinforce or back down on his position in the theme.  <br><br>The scene's on, the characters are variously reacting to what Arjuna's trying to do, he's in his element and on his feet running. It's time to bring in some opposition. The kid who's seen him kill the gang leader stands up in the meeting and although obviously afraid of him, challenges him right there. In something like post traumatic stress disorder, he's conflated all of the events of the day Arjuna and his buddy came to topple the gang  made everything focus on Arjuna: In the kid's mind, Arjuna's unnatural, and he's not just killed the leaders of the gangs, but members that were no more than kids, running for their lives. <br><br>He threatens to reveal to the group that Arjuna's not a hero, but a monster. Brand responds to him powerfully and in character, Arjuna realizes that the confrontation with the kid is going to be the thing that makes or breaks the meeting, and so a debate ensues as Arjuna has to fight hard to calm the kid down, contain his reaction and defend his theme. He does so successfully, and wins the group over, forming a neighborhood watch group.<br><br>(Daniel: There is also a difference between opposition within a theme, like the kid above that poses the question "How hard will you work within your theme?" and opposing theme altogether, like if the neighborhood watch started working together to perform vigilante killings that pose the question "Do you even *want* this to be your theme?")<br><br>Thematic reinforcement: Providing followup to the results of the opposition to cement the accomplishment that the character made in game and showcase the effect the character has had in the game.<br><br>Several days later, Arjuna's been out of the neighborhood and he comes back into the middle of a scene where the neighborhood watch is in action, doing the stuff he asked them to do. There's a rich kid in the neighborhood cruising to buy drugs, and one of the women in his group has told him that there aren't any gangs or drugs in G Block anymore. Nobody will sell to him here. When the kid gets physical, there are whistles from the watchers in the windows, and the Guardian Angel dude leans out a window with a gun to make him back off.<br><br>What those things *are* or how to *do* those things is not what I was looking for in the other thread when I asked about calibrating thematic opposition. Instead, it was about developing skills or tools to help GM's make sure that the thematic opposition was calibrated optimally to the situation at hand. <br><br>I have no trouble recognizing a character's thematic flag, explicitly (via a character sheet) or implicitly (via character action or player discussion). I have no problem coming up with situations that reinforce, challenge or acknowledge those themes, what I'm looking for is ways to tell, heading into the conflict that the thematic opposition I'm bringing is calibrated for frequency, quality, intensity and scale to bring it in the most optimal way for that particular character/player and his connection to his theme.<br><br>ETA: xposted with Josh, who astonishingly, is sharing my brain.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to be simmering this a bit. I just wanted to let you know my silence is not a lack of interest.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I think this is fascinating and vital. As I prepare to GM <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> for the first time, I'm focusing a lot on these issues. The game system obviously delivers. But I don't want just a lot of escalating conflicts. I'll be trying to phrase the character creation process for the Players so there are plenty of tea-leaves all over the character sheet for me to read. A lot of Players (especially if I get folks new to these new-fangled games) might not see how all those Traits, Relationships,Belongings and -- especially -- the choice of what the Initiation are about -- are their chances to really put what they care about into an RPG. Sure, one can come up with a collection of bits and characteristics... But that's not what i want my group's PCs to be about.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I have a few quick comments....<br/>
<br/>
People who are psychic (or claim to be psychic, or whatever -- and I meet lots of 'em, don't ask me why) always say to me, "You're psychic." To which I reply, "Naw, I just pay attention."<br/>
<br/>
So, i don't think there's anything "magical" about this ability. And I really want to spike that word and that kind of thinking right away. Aesthetic judement may be squishier than some folks like, but it's not magic. I believe that for the most part it's paying attention.<br/>
<br/>
Second, when you wrote ICE -- are you talking about "in-character" or "internet chat" or something. Because right now I only know how to do something like this face to face -- where all the tells are available in conversation. I've been following the SotC thread, and grinding my teeth thinking, these guys would have wrapped these early bits up in four mintues if they'd just been able to see each other's faces and hands gesturing. So, if we're doing online stuff, I have no experience and it's completely different (though god knows others are great at it.)<br/>
<br/>
Third, when you write, "when the GM looks at the back of the Sorcerer sheets, sees a dozen different concepts and then somehow ties them together into a nice, satisfying gordian knot for the players to poke at," all I can say is, "No, no, no... At least not from my experience."<br/>
<br/>
As I tried to make clear in my last post, this stuff isn't (and I dont' think can be) all prepped up front. 90% of it will be teased and prodded into existence and clarity <i>during scenes right there at the table</i>. I recomend looking at the quote I pulled from Ron's reply about GM Anxiety (which I quoted in full in Tony's GM Anxiety thread.)<br/>
<br/>
There will be no gordian knot. I don't think there <i>can be</i> a gordian knot. The players shouldn't have some<i>thing</i> they can prod at. Everyone at the table should be making this stuff up as they go.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about this before I saw your post:<br/>
<br/>
If, after three sessions of play, the GM realizes everyone's really focused on family. And he's got this bad guy that everyone hates. But the bad guy's still kind of sketchy (like the villain of a good, serialized TV show), he should happily make the bad guy the father of three to up the thematic stakes for the Players.<br/>
<br/>
Now, in some RPG circles this is tantamount to pissing on the Bible. Changing an NPCs background willy-nilly is destroying the sancitity of the world. In storytelling circles, however, this is called, "doing your job."<br/>
<br/>
When you look at how much actual story content is generated in a three hour play session, with say four players, it's really not that much. But I think we get stuck in old RPG habits and get fixated one what we think NEEDS to be true already. We set things in stone in our own (private, not shared) imagination, and miss the fact that there's so much flexibility to be tapped. Within that flexibility, scence by scene, session by session, we're making a lot of it up as we go along. As we should. (Again, Story Now.)<br/>
<br/>
And I refer again to Ron's post about GM Anxiety. I'll quote this portion:<br/>
<br/>
<b><i>However, the reality is much easier. In many ways, it is like learning how not to use certain muscles when doing something athletic - rather than having dozens of responsibilities at the moment, you really only have one or two, leaving the rest up to others' input and to the interactions during the scene itself. Instead of concerning yourself with the perfect setup, you begin with the minimum necessary and then only concern yourself with playing within the scene.</i></b><br/>
<br/>
This is all about letting go of the gordian knot ahead of time for the Players to poke and prod.<br/>
<br/>
In my view, trying to create the gordian knot ahead of time is the thematic version of trying to create a "world" for the Players to poke and prod. Again, I don't think it can be done, I think it removes the focus from play to everything-before-play, and creates a lot of anxiety for the GM that is counter-productive because he can't do what he's expecting himself to do and removing his delight in working with the players on this stuff in actual play.<br/>

                            Well, after Mo's post I'll back out. I certainly don't want to derail anything.<br/>
<br/>
I find it fascinating that Mo says she has no trouble spotting flags, Joshua calls it magic, Mo thinks they're sharing the same brain. But I'm clearly not getting the beat here.<br/>
<br/>
I'll repeat I think you guys are working harder at this than you need to. If I were to continue the conversation, I might ask, "Mo, do the player's get to jump in with, 'No, no, not the store owner's brother. It's <i>my PCs brother</i> that tries to shoot my PC in the back."<br/>
<br/>
But from Mo's response I think I'm not seeing the problem, or underthinking the problem. Or something.<br/>

                            Christopher, yeah, ICE is Ice Cream Emporer, AKA Daniel.  No big.<br><br>The gordian knot is, as I think about it, my personal preferences showing through.  Those are the situations that I like best, and I was a little careless with my phrasing, there.  Suffice to say, when you prep any game that requires prep, you are prepping <em>something</em>, and in order to produce that something, you do some things with your brain and maybe some paper and pencils.  My question is what steps are taken, and can they be written out so they can be replicated rather than learned via trial-and-error experience?  (And prep isn't the whole of it, which I'll get to in a moment)<br><br>As far as the "magic" moment, the scare-quotes are important, there.  I'm not saying it's magic; far from it.  I'm saying that it's often shrouded in mystery, "just do it" instructions, and intuitive leaps of aesthetics.  In reality, though, it's a set of skills that the GM uses to create a situation.  As you sink your teeth into prepping <em>Dogs</em>, I think Town Creation is a great point-man for this process; it breaks the whole "how do you create an interesting scenario" into a step-by-step process so even someone with an only rudimentary understanding of story and narrative structure can still produce a situation that will lead to interesting play.  In <em>Dogs</em>, it's not a mysterious and intuitive practice (for the most part), it's a step-by-step procedure.  I want that: I want an engineering of gaming rather than a mystery religion.<br><br>And as you have said, it's not all in the prep, which I can totally get behind.  The vast bulk of calibrating thematic opposition happens after play begins, either between sessions or in the moment.  But here, too, all we have is "if it feels wrong, change it, and if something feels right, run with it."  Which relies absolutely on an amorphously-defined sense of "feels right/wrong" that the GM is supposed to have from... somewhere.  Ron has done some work towards this in describing GMing in terms of the observable reactions of the players at the table, and this is perhaps one of the saddest spurs of undeveloped thought in gaming.  How can we develop that, and take it a few more steps forward, to give GMs real solid advice on how to identify when things need to be calibrated and how to do it?<br><br>Ben, the GM's interests are certainly important, here, and additionally it's not all up to the GM to do all of the callibration of opposition.  The other players at the table should be providing at least some opposition through most play (inter-Dog conflicts immediately spring to mind).  The players are also perfectly capable (if not often mechanically supported) of providing thematic opposition to the GM.  Ideally, everybody at the table should be engaged in the content provided by everybody else, and be providing <em>just the right amount</em> of opposition to the themes that are developing through play.  It's the "just the right amount" bit that we're after, here.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hmmm... I've been thinking about this a lot more.  I started writing a playtest draft of Silent Sound and I've run into similar issues.<br><br>First, I think I'm with you Josh in that I do prefer backstory to be pre-play fixed.  This is the default in Sorcerer as per Sorcerer's Soul.  This is the default in Dogs as per the Town Creation rules.  Funny, but I tend to ret-con the backstory MORE in games which are NOT designed for Story Now play because I have to chace after an ever changing of focus.  The result is usually that the game is unable to reach an ending because I keep inventing in more and more content and the result is sort of like the never ending Soap Opera.  When backstory is fixed, the players must judge and act on what is there.  When what is there resolves, the game is over.<br><br>Dogs makes this easier than Sorcerer because Dogs is much less personal in its construction than Sorcerer.  To me Dogs is like a more meatier version of Star Trek.  The characters show up, are (fairly) detached from the situation, but must quickly become the catalyst for that situation.  Thus you can write a Dogs town and run it with a whole bunch of different people with no changes at all.  That's impossible in Sorcerer.<br><br>Now, with that said, I tend to forget that my experince of having run several Dogs towns back to back with the same people is a bit unique.  There is a section of the Dogs book that talks about how the GM should look at the judgements the players made in the previous town and more or less escalate those issues as whole in the next town.  I'm particularly fond young romantic characters who believe in something valuable but make horrible decisions in the pursuit of it.  Meghann HATES these characters.  HATES 'EM.<br><br>Anyway, after one particular scenario with a particularly misguided youth she added this trait: "Cynic in the face of youthful romanticism." which she later reworded as: "There is no Holy Grail."  The very next down I knew the Pride through Demonic Attacks section HAD to be the result of a "youthful romantic" and the False Doctrine through Hate &amp; Murder section had to be about the elders of the town punishing "youthful romantics."<br><br>The town opens with the Dogs staring at a gallows with a teenage boy hanging in the wind a few days dead.  A sign is nailed on the gallows that reads, "Spare the Rod, Spoil The Child.<br><br>So the The Creation Process of Dogs does refine with multiple towns over multiple play sessions because the Pride, Injustice or Sorcery steps tend to start reflecting this that came out in the previous Town.  In terms of communicating this in a procedural manner, I'm not sure you can do better than Dogs.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

This made my head go "ping". <i>Capes</i> does this pretty neatly, because conflicts are essentially auctions - push too hard, and your opponents will bail out and leave you short of your resource harvest optimum.

Depends on the game I'm playing, but the games currently on the table? Yup. And yes, I can see that there is player input to be taken in the process, but it shouldn't stop me from trying to hone skills (or for that matter, design games that enable GM's or players to) zone in on the sweet spot that's exactly right in the moment.<br><br>It's not so much that there's a *problem* Chris, but especially for someone like me that's new to GMing and pretty process minded, approaching skill building in a deliberate, reflective way makes for stronger skills in the end. I'm not working too hard, I'm thinking about it, and then trying things on for size to see how they fit.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I want that: I want an engineering of gaming rather than a mystery religion.</blockquote>
Exactly! So... if most of the stuff can't be handled in prep, what can be? And for things that must happen in play, are we up shit's creek if we hoped to get a procedure to calibrate? Are there modular tools in game that can help, or would the system need hard coding to provide any substantial support?                        </br></br></div>

                            Well, I don't know if this will help anyone else, but after some discussion on the Foundry I came up with an AP example of the sort of problem I think Mo is talking about. (If not, I hope she will say so!) Hopefully looking at some examples of the problem will help make it clearer what sort of procedures might be available to help.<br><br>So the scene in question occured in an online game of DitV that Brand was running sometime earlier this year. It was the first or second session, and the first town. Both my PC (Isaac) and another PC (Adrian) had some significant flags up surrounding domestic physical abuse. Isaac felt like his father had somehow beat the devil into him -- that he was permanently broken as a result of his treatment. It was a big, important theme that I definitely was interested in, and I had a bunch of traits to prove it. Not long before the scene started (either right before, or before the previous scene) Brand explicitly asked Adrian's player (who had up until this point been having some trouble getting into things) what sort of actions would provoke his PC to action, and he responded with, paraphrased, 'someone hurting their children'. All this to establish that <i>finding appropriate thematic content</i> was definitely not the problem here. We were all on the same page there.<br><br>The scene in question involved the Dogs going to question a Steward about the activities of his son, who they suspected was complicit in a nearly-fatal hanging. Not wasting any time, Brand immediately established that the Steward was a fan of the rod -- when his son refused to confess or otherwise explain himself, the Steward took up a stick and began thrashing him.<br><br>So far, so good, at least as far as I was concerned. Here was a classic authority figure who beat his son, and here was a son who had done some wrong things -- and here was Isaac, a nineteen year old Dog with absolutely no idea what to do. A conflict began whose stakes are not clear to memory, but which mostly involved 'get the Steward to stop beating his son.'<br><br>It was at this point that I think, at least for me, trouble began. Isaac began with some very nervous talking, and Brand -- in a pretty excellent escalation -- has the Steward turn on Isaac. With some comment about how he's going to beat the trouble out of him. Abusers know a victim when they see one, after all -- and from Isaac's point of view this is all pretty damn familiar.<br><br>The problem was that as a player, I had seen a scene like this coming ever since I made the character. I was pumped, and I was caught up in the 'escalate! hardcore!' drama of the moment. So Isaac grabs the stick out of the Steward's hands and starts yelling at him about how this is all his fault -- how the whole reason Isaac and the Steward's boy are like 'this' is because they've been poisoned by people just like the Steward.<br><br>Meanwhile, Adrian's player whips out a knife and hamstrings the Steward. Escalation city, blood everywhere, with Brand (bless his heart) purposefully piling on the fallout as the Steward takes the blow. Isaac freaks out and bolts, unable to deal with the consequences of his violent reaction.<br><br>Sounds like a pretty good scene. And at the time, it was. But the more I thought about it afterwards, the more upset I got about the way things had turned out. Because, well, it was too much. Too intense, too much escalation -- at least on my part. I had just accidentally skipped over a huge portion of Isaac's emotional development, cutting out a big part of a thematic arc because I had gotten so jazzed about the possibilities of the moment. If I could have taken it back I would have had Isaac give as soon as the Steward started to beat him. I forgot to establish the parts of the theme revolving around powerlessness and defeat that would have given resistance and revenge their proper due -- I just jumped straight to the violence, skipping the build-up.<br><br>--<br><br>So, there's an example of the sort of problem I'm talking about. In the moment, I lost track of the larger picture, and I ended up with a scene that had <i>too much</i> thematic intensity. There was nothing wrong with the scene itself, but its context was all wrong from my point of view -- it's the sort of thing that should have happened several towns later, after I'd had some time to develop the whole domestic violence theme a little.<br><br>So the question is: how could I have avoided this mistake, as a player? How could Brand have helped me avoid this mistake, as a GM? Was there something going on that contributed to this, that some sort of system mechanic or technique could have mitigated? Or was it just some sort of unavoidable error on my part, a crucial loss of perspective? And if so, once I realised my mistake (days later) what if anything could I have done about it?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Daniel, <br><br>Mo is making a post about this, I'm sure. So, since I was there with you, I'm only going to put in one observation: <br><br>When you say "developed over the course of several towns" it shows that you were thinking something different about the game than I was. I'd signed on to GM one town of Dogs, after which we were going to have Josh do a game of FLFS. So I wasn't thinking there were going to be more towns for you to develop it in. It was that town or not. (Though there is still the fact that we were early in the town, and it didn't need to happen in that scene.) <br><br>I think there is something there worth noting, in terms of thematic development: there is a difference between the way that a short story or movie develops and the way a TV season does and again the way a novel does. Knowing which of those things you're doing can be necessary for making theme come out at the right rate. <br><br>That's why PTA's season setup rocks -- it lets you know what length of time you have for theme, and not only that situates your time to focus your theme and rock it by the spacing of spotlight episodes. If we'd been in that town and you'd had a SP of 1, I would have soft-shoed the dad. If it was a 2 I would have pushed it, but not brutalized it. And a 3? Yea, pretty much what happened in the actual game. And, I think, it wouldn't just have been me -- seeing the numbers on your own sheet would remind you, and the other players, where you were in the game so as to fit your level of response correctly. Or, in other words, to calibrate it. <br><br>This hard-coded knowledge of length of thematic address is also why a lot of one shot games can rock so much -- because everyone knows you're in short story mode and you have to do it NOW or not at all. Of course, as Jonathan Walton has pointed out, just because its a one shot doesn't mean everyone would want it to be balls to the walls every moment, as some folks like their themes soft and subtle. But at least with one shots we've got the "length" calibrated, if not the intensity. <br><br>So I think we need more techniques (even if it is just sitting down as a group and saying, "This is a novel, so take your thematics slowly") to get folks onto the same page about how fast and hard things should be happening.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Daniel,<br><br>Yes, that's the kind of thing I'm looking at, but was approaching it from a GM perspective because that's what I'm trying to learn right now. There's a couple of things I'm taking away from your example... <br><br/>One is that things get even more complicated when you don't understand yourself in the moment of the conflict that you're pursuing something that is beyond, (or I suppose, falls short of) the place where your theme should be churning. So maybe we need to ask another question as well: How can I learn, or is there something that can help me how to calibrate what I need? Because well, if we don't know ourselves, than we can't expect a GM to have a hope of knowing what we want, right? Good observation.<br/><br/>Another is that we're not always talking about a two player interaction; we're also sometimes talking about other players that are involved, and their (often conflicting, competing or contrasting) needs to interact with the same opposition you are interacting with. In that situation, is there a "right" person that the opposition is meant for? Sometimes that answer looks clear, sometimes it doesn't. If the GM can't control who goes for what, how much harder does it become to calibrate who managed to catch it on a dime? How much responsibility do other players have to provide (by creating opposition or by  relinquishing or taking game opportunities) opposition for each other. Is calibration a group activity, and if so, how much more difficult does it become?<br/><br/>Issac and Adrian both were pursuing the exact same theme, but Adrian needed or wanted opposition to reach one intensity and you wanted it to reach another. Say you actually recognized in the moment that you needed less intense escalation - would there have been less of a problem? Possibly. <br/><br/>Maybe you could have gone OOC and said "Hrm. Lem, how much do you need the escalation to be this intense?" and Lem could have said "Why? It rawks!" and you could have said, "I have no problem escalating to this kind of level in this game, but I would get so much more of a big emotional punch out of it if we started off smaller and escalated to this over the next couple of conflicts. It's like an 8 out of 10 critical to my fun." and Lem might have said "Oh. Well I'm rocking here, but you know, this particular conflict is only like a 3 for me. As long as you let me loose this game, I'll back off now." and you might both have gotten through it that way, but without something like it, because Dogs encourages escalation, you'd be the one out in the cold.<br/><br/>But, even that level of negotiation is impossible to folks who don't have that kind of approach to each other, or don't have the maturity to make room for each other's fun, and sliding out of the scene for that length of a negotiation could have critically broken the momentum or emotional intensity of the players' connection to the story. Maybe with practice that conversation could be shorthanded into a more efficient technique. He escalates, you say, shaking your head: "Dude? 8." and Lem could shrug and say "3." and change his play.<br/><br/>There's some support for this kind of group ranking in PTA, where issues aren't allowed to overlap, and where spotlight episodes mitigate the need to figure out who takes priority. Anybody know of any other games or tools that do this?                        </br></br></br></div>

These statements tie into my initial response to this sort of high-resolution 'calibration' in the conversation the other night: isn't the answer just better communication among players? I feel like once you get to the point where you've got the right <i>kinds</i> of themes, fine-tuning at this sort of level just isn't something that a system or a process is necessarily going to help. Unless, as you suggest, it's a system and process for communicating outside the game about what's going on. <br/><br/>There comes a point, in my mind, after which you are talking about the sort of fine adjustments and twists and 'tells' that are so idiosyncratic to the individuals and the game fiction involved that it's really going to come down to 'how good are these people at understanding thematic issues and how good are they at communicating to each other?' And it's not that there aren't techniques to help with that, I guess, they just feel somehow beyond the scope of the usual conversations here. "How do I read people?" is not a small question, and neither is "how do I know what I want out of this moment in time?"<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>To respond to some of the example stuff: I purposefully minimized Adrian/Lem's role in my description of the game because from the point of view of my 'problem' with the scene the knifing and the blood didn't really figure into it. It was all around how I had Isaac act and react to one or two raises/sees -- a very short space of time that nonetheless created a fair bit of long-term dissatisfaction. I don't think communication between us would have done much to scale the intensity, because the critical problem was that <i>I wasn't quite paying enough attention</i>. Both to what I wanted out of the scene and to my ideas about what was appropriate for the character -- particularly the latter. Which again ties in to my concern that the real issue is ultimately "how do we make everyone really self-aware and also adept at analysing thematic content?" And my answer is, at least so far... "buh? have them read a lot of books and take a lot of university courses? And then practice a lot?"                        </div>

                            Daniel, you said: <br/><br/>"There comes a point, in my mind, after which you are talking about the sort of fine adjustments and twists and 'tells' that are so idiosyncratic to the individuals and the game fiction involved that it's really going to come down to 'how good are these people at understanding thematic issues and how good are they at communicating to each other?'"<br/><br/>What about the stuff I talked about with PTA? That is a systematic technique to help deal with just such issues. Really, at this point it sounds very much like you're saying "I don't see a way to help structure these things, so I don't think there is a way to structure them."<br/><br/>Which is fine, if that's how you feel. However a lot of folks have found ways to structure similar issues (this is what things like The Mountain Witch, PTA, and Dogs grew up around) in other ways. Really, much of the whole emphasis of the systems of Indie game design is, as you say, structuring the social situation and communication around the table. They do it through the focus of the game so that you don't have to take university courses. Dogs town creation is a method that just about anyone can use to make a town that's at least passable, which is something that a lot of folks spent years saying "its just something the GM has to have the right feel for" as their whole system for doing. <br/><br/>That issues like knowing what players want from game, when they want it, how to structure it to make story and that groups can teach each other how to play together through the system of the game is a huge reason why Dogs, PTA, Polaris, Mountain Witch, etc, etc, etc came out. Because things like this can be at least partly systematized. And I don't think that just because we've come a long way on those things means that we're on the limit of what we can do. Just as people used to say that you can't make a system to make a fun and explosive situation, that it's a GM talent, until Dogs started to break that, I'm hoping that in a few years we'll look back on this discussion and say, "Well that was before Josh and Daniel did their thematic round system, and now we all can just do step 1, 2, 3, and get that going easily...."  <br/><br/>So now we're just looking for ways to either a) continue that at a new level or b) alternate methods of doing those things for the people for whom the current methods don't hit the sweet spot. If you're not interested in that, or don't think it can happen... then why are you talking about it? What is your interest in the thread, man, because right now it really feels like you're just blocking. Is it that you'd like tools like that, but just can't see a way to make them work?                        </div>

                            Actually, I have to say my last post reminded me of something I'd been talking about with one of the Matt's recently. <br/><br/>When faced with a challenge that one wants to overcome there are a couple of paradigms about how to do it. The mystical, inner, humanities driven path is to improve oneself until one can do the thing inherently. The materialist, external, science based path is to create structures (or gadgets) that let anyone do the thing by using the gadget. (A third answer, and one I talked about with Matt, is that it can't be solved and so trying is pointless. The fourth that occurs to me in this moment is to deny that there is a problem at all.) <br/><br/>Daniel, it really sounds like you're focused on the first way as being the only way this gets solved -- to make us all better within ourselves, more self aware, more able to generate plot from our own brains without the need for systematic structure. Mo, on the other hand, is looking for more of the second -- making structures that anyone can use, device like, to get a consistent result. <br/><br/>Personally, I've done a lot of work on that first way, developing my own skills as a GM. It works real well for me, but I see a lot of value in the second way -- especially if you want to help people beyond those you have the ability to personally mentor, as well as it being easier to teach someone a process than to impart gnosis upon them.  (Also, I've found that one can lead to the other. Doing Dogs Town Gadget has helped me learn more in my inner understanding sense, and my inner understanding sense probably helps me make better Dogs towns. Doing one can, if given the chance, lead to the other.) <br/><br/>So the split, in a lot of ways, is paradigmatic.                        </div>

                            Daniel,<br/>
<br/>
I have a bunch of questions and a bunch of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious that you wrote, "Sounds like a pretty good scene. And at the time, it was." And then, "But the more I thought about it afterwards, the more upset I got about the way things had turned out."<br/>
<br/>
How long after was "afterwards"? Seconds later? As soon as the game ended? The next day?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what was your character's initiation?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what Traits, Relationships, Belongings or Fallout were on the character sheet bore on the Conflict or Thematic issue.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the answers to these questions yet, but I'm going to shoot my wad on this because it's a follow up to what I've written so far. (Even if the following makes no sense, if you could provide the AP answers to the questions above, I'd still appreciate it. Because, despite apparently airy-fairy appearances to the contrary, I'm a hard-core formalist when it comes to the creative act.)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here goes:<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that a) the scene, as played, was fucking excellent; and b) your initial reaction seems spot on and well deserved.<br/>
<br/>
Why then the second guessing? Because you weren't <i>done</i> yet.<br/>
<br/>
This might sound strange, so bear with me.<br/>
<br/>
You ramped up really fast. I get that. You wanted to reveal more about your character, slowly build to the scene, because, as you said,"I had seen a scene like this coming ever since I made the character," and we often think that the moments we're most looking forward to should delayed] because it's <i>so</i> cool.<br/>
<br/>
I'm here to say a bunch of things, and the first is, seldom is the previous point true. The best thing to do when creating a story is to SLAP that thing your excited about down on the table and get if over with as soon as it makes sense narratively. Why? So you can get on to the even COOLER thing waiting around the table.<br/>
<br/>
There's whole bunch of talkin' I can do about this point, and if you want me to I will, but the short hand is this:<br/>
<br/>
We don't trust ourselves. I'm speaking from the tradion of acting and writing, which I think are two traditions of value to draw from for story-games.<br/>
<br/>
So, we don't trust ourselves. We think we have one idea, maybe two, and we can't even conceive we'll have another good idea. It doesn't even occur to us to even ask if we could have another idea (one that might even be better than the one we've got.)<br/>
<br/>
We've got our one idea, and we want to hang on to it, and we want to polish it, and wait to play it, and "build up" to it, and "set it up" because if we do that, at least we've got that one good idea.<br/>
<br/>
But this is a lie. We are human beings. There is always one more idea. And after that idea, there is another one. And this is always true. There is always one more idea.<br/>
<br/>
And because of how I've been interpreted so far, I need to make something clear. This isn't some New Age Go Team Woo-Woo. It's not a "mystery religion." It's a hard fact that I've gleaned from observing my own work habits and from coaching other actors and writers. We think we have only one solution, one idea, one card to play. And this is false.<br/>
<br/>
You play the card. And then you find out what the next card is. That's the way it <i>works.</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm not suprised you saw the scene coming. <i>It's a fucking great scene.</i> It's also more than you thought you should have done, and you didn't know what to do next. Which brings me to my next point:<br/>
<br/>
What could you have done next?<br/>
<br/>
See, you had a vision for your character, right? Beaten down, <i>not</i> violent. Having to build up to that blow out.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, when the creative juices were flowing, when play was <i>happening</i>, when the game was <i>working</i>, when it was time to deliver the dramatic goods -- what did we discover?<br/>
<br/>
That your fucked up, child-abused character, when given his first chance to <i>use his authority</i> fucking went to town.<br/>
<br/>
And all I can say is, "Okay! Excellent!"<br/>
<br/>
See, he, as a character, may have had a vision of himself as the downtrodden kid who was going to make things right by not-being violent. He might not have seen himself as having the ability to hurt a fly. He might have had a whole story about who he was, and what he could do and couldn't do. We all have stories like that -- the stories we tell ourselves about who we are and what we could or couldn't do.<br/>
<br/>
And then, when put into a moment of crisis, where he basically had been giving carte blanche to kick someone's ass -- all for the right reason -- what did he do? He did exactly what his papa taught him to do -- He seized that authority and kicked ass.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let's just freeze frame this for a moment. This is excellent storytelling and excellent development of thematic material. Because the protagonist has just revealed who he really is in his actions, despite what story he carried around in his head. And, of course, you believed his story as well.<br/>
<br/>
So, who is this guy REALLY? A fucking abused man ready to abuse others, despite his desires.<br/>
<br/>
And this surprised you! And all I can say is, "Welcome to story-now! You made it, son! Welcome!"<br/>
<br/>
Really, this is it.<br/>
<br/>
I know it takes away all the issues of "pacing" and "development" and whatever else we want to do to avoid the challenging work of avoid getting down in the mud and finding out what happens <i>next</i> -- but there it is.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot tell you how many scripts I read from beginning writers where <i>nothing</i> is thrown down in the first fifteen pages -- and you ask, "What is this story about?" and they answer, "Well, on page 62..." I mean, forget about it.<br/>
<br/>
So, in Story Now <i>we surprise <b>ourselves</b></i>. This is such a vital point. We surprise <i>ourselves.</i> There's a moment happening, we need to fill it with something, and we commit. There is no choice but to commit, to play the card and find out what happens next.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I meant in my long post to Tony about trusting the thematic content as a Unifying element to provide Variety -- <i>no matter where that Variety leads!</i> Your theme is abuse. You had (as far as I can tell) a vision of your guy being the abused boy who later explodes. And yet, something unexpected happened. Your guy <i>became abusive</i>. It's not what he expected, it's not what you expected, but it's what happened. And it was great.<br/>

<br/>
Now, here's another point: The way you concieved of the pacing after the fact would have worked fine, too. It's just that, in the moment of Story Now -- which you played beautifully -- you did something else.<br/>
<br/>
So the question is <i>not</i>, "Why didn't I do it the other way?" The question is, "Okay, now what?"<br/>
<br/>
So, let's look at the possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
We're playing <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, right? So you Gave, right? Which means you walk out of there with your highest die to set up the next Conflcit spun off this scene, right? I mean, Vincent's a smart guy, so he set all this up on purpose. (Which is why I think talking about this stuff independent of the actual rules is asking for a world of trouble -- because the rules are another one of the Unifying elments I'm talking about that will then let us spin Variety. Please note: I'm not talking about the rules as a safety-net -- I'm talking about the rules as springboard for the next idea -- and that's a huge difference.)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, you pull your guy out of the scene and your thinking, "Fuck, where'd that come from?" And, if you're like me, you offer the possibility that your protagonist is something a little seperate from you and he too is asking, "Fuck, where'd that come from?" ("Isaac freaks out and bolts, unable to deal with the consequences of his violent reaction.")<br/>
<br/>
And you'v got the die from Giving. And the rules are fucking pointing with a big Sign Saying, "What's the next Conflict?"<br/>
<br/>
Which brings us back to my first point about trusting you'll have another idea -- an even BETTER idea that will build on the idea you've already played.<br/>
<br/>
If you trust yourself into it, you will. Because we are pattern making creatures and pattern appreciating creatures. And you don't need any more game rules to guide you here. Once you focus on the theme of Abuse, and combine it with the scene that just occurred (which stunned both you and your character) and affected you both terribly, and mix in <i>Dog's</i> rules, what's going to happen next will be fascinating and unexpected and cool as all hell -- because we <i>don't know where we're going</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Because your guy isn't the sad, abused boy who means well and finally snaps. He's revealed himself to be fucking potential monster who's been invested with the authority to beat and murder people -- and that's trouble!<br/>
<br/>
Does he try to make amends with the Steward? Does Issac try to get the Steward's son to behave so <i>he won't be forced to use his authority to fix the Steward again</i>? Does he toughen up and demand he <i>never back down again</i> -- and go marching back to set that asshole of Steward straight? Does he go off to pray for a sign he can quit the Dogs to make sure he's never in a situation to do anything like that again?<br/>
<br/>
You're character went to far. You were deeply affected by that. Good! Now ask what happens in response!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what would happen. And neither did you. And my guess is that you thought there was nowhere left to go after that.<br/>
<br/>
But you had touched nerves for both your character and for you. And the thing to do next was ask, "Wow, what happens next?"<br/>
<br/>
These are tools. They are not game rules. But they are tools. Hard tools that demand practice and discpline and effort.<br/>
<br/>
â€¢ Know there is always one more idea.<br/>
â€¢ Use the theme/issue at hand as a Unifying element and spins Variations on the theme/issue to jump-start a scene whenever you're stuck.<br/>
â€¢ Know that no matter what happens -- keep building.<br/>
â€¢ Know that what we did in the creative moment was good enough and that by <i>continuing</i> it'll get even better.<br/>
â€¢ Do not "save" moments that excite us, but play them when we've got them -- desptite our fears -- knowing we <i>will</i> continue to create dramatic escalation (even if it seems like there's nowhere to go dramatically).<br/>
â€¢ The story is not the story we expect. We find it in the telling.<br/>
* If you've just had a big dramatic scene full of physical flash and you find your dissatisified -- trust your dissatisfaction and in the next scene <i>go deeper.</i> (Going deeper, even if more quietly, <i>is </i> a form of dramatic escalation. You weren't dissatisfied because the scene was bad -- but because there was more to be said. Say it in the next scene.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, this means not knowing where we're going, being surprised that we're giving up ideas and expectations, and trusting our perhaps still undisciplined sense of aesthetics and intuiticn.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't make it any easier. The nerves still jangle, you still don't know for sure if it will work. But it works.<br/>

                            Hi Mo,<br/>
<br/>
I'm still thinking a lot about this matter -- from the GM's perspective.<br/>
<br/>
And I appreciate there's a disconnect on my part from what you're looking for. Clearly, while I don't think this is a small matter all, I'm also not seeing it from the point of view you're seeing it from.<br/>
<br/>
So after reading around a bit something clicked in my head, and I've got a few questions and comments as I search for greater clarification:<br/>
<br/>
I'll start from the point that there's a "concern" about something... Something will go wrong, or a player will lose interest (as Joshua suggested might happen in his first post), or it'll be too strong and the player will be put off.<br/>
<br/>
1) So, is the conern that the GM will "break" a narrative element (kill a beloved NPC) that will piss the player off?<br/>
<br/>
2) Is the concern that the GM will introduce a thematic push that will in turn force the Player into a choice he or she doesn't want to make?<br/>
<br/>
3) Is it that the GM will toss something onto the table that will interest three playes but not the fourth, leaving the fourth player out in the cold?<br/>
<br/>
4) Is it that the GM will introduce content that might disturb or offend or creep out the Players outside the scope of the narrative. ("Jeez, Jenny, why'd you have to bring that up? I don't want to play at all now.")<br/>
<br/>
I ask these questions because I see each of them as four seperate issues.<br/>

                            I'm coming to this party late, so I'll load a couple of ideas in to one post:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Sounds like a pretty good scene. And at the time, it was. But the more I thought about it afterwards, the more upset I got about the way things had turned out. Because, well, it was too much. Too intense, too much escalation -- at least on my part. I had just accidentally skipped over a huge portion of Isaac's emotional development, cutting out a big part of a thematic arc because I had gotten so jazzed about the possibilities of the moment. If I could have taken it back I would have had Isaac give as soon as the Steward started to beat him. I forgot to establish the parts of the theme revolving around powerlessness and defeat that would have given resistance and revenge their proper due -- I just jumped straight to the violence, skipping the build-up.</blockquote>
My experience with Dogs is that it plays from big to small.  The intuition most GMs have coming to Dogs for the first time is not to go for the top.  Get to Pride, make the town easy.  And what I've seen (and been advised) is that the easiest towns in Dogs are already irredeemably awful.  Simplest thing in the world to herd every man, woman and child of a corrupt branch into the meeting hall, set it on fire, and ride on.  It's the little towns, where the bad isn't that bad yet, that are the hardest for the players to deal with.  By analogy, I'd suggest that something similar might hypothetically go for your character.<br><br>Following a big splash of bloody violence, every other abuser scene is going to be tinged with the anxiety that he'll do it again.  And the more subtly drawn the abuse, or the more ambiguous the situation, the bigger the scene winds up being.  My immediate intuition is a possessed girl who the Steward beats to drive back the demon - and she thanks him.  What does your abused-turned-angry dog do then?
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>As you sink your teeth into prepping<em>Dogs</em>, I think Town Creation is a great point-man for this process; it breaks the whole "how do you create an interesting scenario" into a step-by-step process so even someone with an only rudimentary understanding of story and narrative structure can still produce a situation that will lead to interesting play.  In<em>Dogs</em>, it's not a mysterious and intuitive practice (for the most part), it's a step-by-step procedure.  I want that: I want an engineering of gaming rather than a mystery religion.</blockquote>
This <em>nailed</em> a niggling doubt I'd had for a long time.  See, I find it incredibly frustrating to work through the <cite>Dogs</cite> town creation rules.  The results work great, but I feel like I'm doing a lot of busywork.  Bizarrely, I'm about to (almost) argue for the mystery religion.  <br><br>Well, not really.  But I'm about to argue against the necessity of situation mechanics.  Not because they don't work, because I think they do.  But because they're not the only thing that would work, or even the best thing for their game.  The analogy I'd make is this one: situation mechanics are like flat-pack furniture, and while Ikea stuff is inexpensive and easy to assemble, we would stand to learn a bit more carpentry.<br><br>Right now, carpentry is like looking at the flags your players hand you, pulling in your own preferences, and jamming.  There's more useful advice than that, but none of it will (or should) get your from raw timber to finished cabinet.  Understanding what pacing is, and having some technique to serve it for instance, or seeing overlaps and resonances between flags, and having a reasonable idea about how to hit the buttons implied.  (There's something to be said for the player's skill of making clear what their flags are, rather than leaving it to the GM to infer.)  <br><br>So the niggling doubt was this: that there are all of these situation generators: R-Maps, Town Creation, Situation Engineering, and one way or another, they all propose (more fair: are considered by their adopters) to be the True Way to produce situation for their domain (especially galling when it's R-Maps and the domain is "role playing.")  Pretty much any end-to-end solution, I'm going to be a little suspicious of.<br><br>Now, what you seem to be asking for, Josh, is a technique within that process.  You're looking for a carpentry skill, like rabbiting.  And I think Shreyas and Christopher are pretty on the mark: you watch what your players express interest in, and you play to that.  That happens up front, when your players give you tea leaves in the form of explicit flags and things they talk about during chargen (the inclusion of which in Situation Engineering continues to impress me, incidentally), and during play when they latch onto stuff, or shrug scenes off.  <br><br>Which sort of brings me to:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Well, that depends on the content of the conflicts. If I simply <em>cannot accept</em> a particular outcome, then I will fight on even if I've stopped having fun.</blockquote>
This completely boggles me.  I mean: I have utter faith that this happens, but I can't think of such a situation in my own experience, outside of a failed social contract.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Whoa, full stop.  Situation Engineering is intended only for <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>.  It does a specific thing for a specific purpose, and I wouldn't want to use it for anything that wasn't an ensemble-based high-character-concept loose-continuity sort of game.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Now, what you seem to be asking for, Josh, is a technique within that process.</blockquote>
I do hope that there are some little insights available for folks to find in Situation Engineering; I know there were a lot of insights in R-Maps and Town Creation.  That these may lead to techniques that can be used outside of their native games is a great bonus.<br><br>On the other hand, I sincerely doubt in the hypothetical existence of a set of techniques -- let's call it a school of thought -- that is universally applicable to all games everywhere.  Different games call for different techniques.  By my sights, the mark of a good game design is that it packages the necessary techniques encoded in its game mechanics, or provides decent guidance regarding those techniques.<br><br>And on the <em>other</em> other hand, situation creation rules are only one half of the problem, if that.  Calibrating thematic opposition is also about modifying things as you go, long after the initial situation has been kicked to shit by the players. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Thematic Support is a better term. I mean, you come to a fork in the road. Down one lies your bitter enemy who you want revenge against, and down the other lies your lifelong love. In this case there's no opposition, just a choice. A fact of topography that forces a decision. But since this is situation we're talking about, how about calling it Theme Producing Situation. Too wordy? Too literal?<br/>
<br/>
Once again, Judson, you have the most curious reading of things. Relationship Maps the "True Way?" Where do you get this stuff? Do people talk about them a lot as a tool for coming up with "Theme Producing Situations?" Yep. But that's mostly because they've been given so few other tools.<br/>
<br/>
Which is not saying that they're not capable of producing these situations on their own, without these tools. They are so capable, and they do it regularly. It's just a tool. Chucking it would feel to me like chucking my three pound hammer from my toolbox. I could probably get by without it, but why? Is it the right tool for every need? Hardly. Might we get lazy and start using it for every application? I know I have used the hammer at times where it wasn't warranted. But that's a simple matter of judgment, and no more fraught with peril than deciding to use any other tool in the box, or not using any particular tool at all.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Town Creation is different. That's more like a kit than a tool. Yeah, if you use the kit, you're going to only get a particular range of results. You can tailor the kit, but in the end you're still going to get a car (or town in this case). But, again, it's a choice to use the kit or not use the kit. To play DitV or not to play DitV. Heck, I'm pretty sure one could play DitV without the town rules if one wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here's the thing. Why use a tool at all, if one can use one's hands just as well? Well, maybe you can do that, Judson. But I find that when I use tools, things work better. I've tried it both ways, and all I can say is that when I use such tools, my play is superior. Maybe I'm handicapped. I dunno. But I'm not giving up the use of these particular tools based on some notion that it might be constraining my play in some bad way somehow. The results just don't match that hypothesis for me.<br/>
<br/>
It's akin to the argument that freeformers have that playing with any mechanics at all is pointlessly constraining. That we can do just as well without. Well, that's not been my experience. Is it a crutch? I think that's just a perspective.<br/>
<br/>
The hammer analogy is a good one, too. Because I think we've seen very few tools here, and only very primitive ones. I think we've yet to see the power saw tool for developing situations that consistently produce theme. And if people want to try to discover that tool, well, I think they should go for it.<br/>
<br/>
Look at how much work there is in RPGs trying to develop the ultimate combat system - take Hero System, for instance. 600 pages all aimed square at providing the best tool for that sort of play. Yes, to date we have relatively smaller texts for "storygames." But, then, OD&amp;D was pretty small, too. It's a matter of development over time, and we're just starting down this road. Combat RPGs have three more decades of background.<br/>
<br/>
Is Hero System "too much" for combat? Well, I dunno, I like it for combat. Again, I think that the amount of system or techniques that you want to employ is just a matter of taste and what fits your abilities. So I think it's totally valid to be awaiting the 600 page tome of storygaming goodness.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Once again, Judson, you have the most curious reading of things.</blockquote>
Glad I could bemuse.  But in reading your response I think more than anything else I might have a curious way of <em>putting</em> things, since I see a lot I agree with.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Now, here's the thing. Why use a tool at all, if one can use one's hands just as well? Well, maybe you can do that, Judson.

If I said something to make you believe that we're not on the same page here, I retract it.  I'll grant an excess of zeal in pursuing my line of thinking, but I do often come across (but couldn't at the moment cite) heady descriptions of relationship maps as the "last tool you'll ever need."  And my response is that R-maps are like a flush-saw.  Handy when you need it, but of limited scope.  And that's where I was coming from: a disillusionment with other people's enthusiasm.  <br><br>Goes for you, too, JBR.  Town Creation and Situation Engineering have a weird taste for me because, on the one hand, they feel constraining.  I want to build a set of cabinets, and instead I've got this flat pack stuff that'll get cabinets up in 10% of the time.  But they really won't be the same cabinets that I'd get starting with lumber and tools.  At the same time, because they're in the rules, ignoring some or all of them feels like more than drift: it feels like <em>cheating,</em> for reasons that aren't exactly on topic.<br><br>I would happily adopt much of your stance as my own, though.  Feel free to replace "technique" in my previous post with "tool."  I think of them as techniques, because that really what they are.  If someone comes up with a story-games slide rule, that'll be a tool.

I completely and strongly agree with you.  I want to see more and better tool-style techniques.  If the Holy Grail is the Chainsaw of Theme, neat, but I don't think there's much chance of discovering it.  By analogy, you're unlikely to find a tool that churns out bed frames, but a router sure is a useful tool.  I want to see the routers, drill presses and table saws of role playing.  And I want to see them advertised as such, with relationship to the other tools.  <br><br>Is it possible that we already have a large number of techniques without any formalized approach on how to apply them?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Goes for you, too, JBR.  Town Creation and Situation Engineering have a weird taste for me because, on the one hand, they feel constraining.  I want to build a set of cabinets, and instead I've got this flat pack stuff that'll get cabinets up in 10% of the time.  But they really won't be the same cabinets that I'd get starting with lumber and tools.  At the same time, because they're in the rules, ignoring some or all of them feels like more than drift: it feels like<em>cheating,</em>for reasons that aren't exactly on topic.</blockquote>
I won't speak for Vincent, but Situation Creation is supposed to be constraining, as it is supposed to create a very specific kind of situation.  It cannot produce any situation that you might conceive of, and it does not create all the possible situations that might involve etherships and navy men.  It creates a tangled set of thematically-engaging crises that the players must unravel.  Cause that's what <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> presents the players with: it's all about who you are and how that affects how you discharge your responsibility towards a situation often not of your creation.<br/><br/>Could you play a game with solar steamers, ether gadgetry, and the Royal Astronomical Navy that doesn't involve driven characters discharging their responsibilities in complicated situations?  Sure.  I'm just not sure if that would be <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> anymore.  It very well may be lots of fun, just like bouncing a basketball against a wall and trying to get it past your friend might be fun but not be basketball.<br/><br/>I think you're right, thought, that this is diverging from the topic.  I may cook up a separate thread for my thinking along these lines, which is starting to boil over.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>It is that the thematic movement will not have an optimal impact.

I'd like to see some games steal more from The Riddle of Steel, which requires players to track multiple thematic avenues at a time. You can't just pick one and hope it works out -- or, well, I guess you can, sort of, but it's harder to do. I think it makes thematic play more like the craps table and less like the roulette wheel.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think that the risk of too much/too soon/too little is necessary in order for this kind of play to be surprising and fun.                        </div>
