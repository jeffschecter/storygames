My group is always on board and we see eye to eye generally.<br/><br/>I have this problem though, where I veto shit a little too often.  See, when we play my goal is to produce fiction that is comparable to literature.  <br/><br/>When we play Dust Devils I want it to be fucking <i>Blood Meridian </i> <br/><br/>When we play Burning Wheel I want it to <i>be</i> Tolkien<br/><br/>When we play IAWA it is Robert E. Howard goddamnit.  <br/><br/>And, well this doesn't work all the time.  Sometimes it does and play is that damn good and we still talk about those campaigns.  I want to recapture that magic each and every time we play.<br/><br/>So yeah I veto shit.  We'll come to a discussion point in game about where somethings going to go or I'll pull the Mountain Witch Trick and the answer won't be <i>perfect</i>.  I'm picky and I'm not a dick about it, the players don't seem to get too discouraged.<br/><br/>I'll say things like "Yeah, that's pretty good, but..."  I clearly know why I do this but I want to stop worrying about making the perfect story.  I just don't want things to be lame and not everything that is thought up on the spur of the moment is golden.  So how do you reconcile this?<br/><br/>I guess at the heart of the issue that I don't 100% agree with Graham's statement from Play Unsafe which states something like "Don't try to be brilliant, be obvious."  <br/><br/>I know from personal experience that sometimes discussing something for 2-4 minutes and digging for the perfect idea sometimes leads to brilliance.  Sometimes it drags things on and the first, obvious thing was best.  <br/><br/>Does anyone else have these same hangups?  How do you deal with and learn to let go?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334085/#Comment_334085" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T15:15:27+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  3:15PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>I'll say things like "Yeah, that's pretty good, but..."

You can definitely try to just be more laid back, and I think Ralph's suggestion is good at a minimum (if you're the only person at the table who ever vetos something, that's a bit sketchy, in terms of social dynamics.) One problem with being that guy -- and I am often that guy -- is that other players might start self-censoring, or basically vetoing-themselves-in-advance, in a non-productive way. (As opposed to doing so, as everybody does, in an attempt to say something appropriate.) <br/><br/>If your goal is to improve your flexibility -- so that sometimes you can be Like That, and sometimes you can Not Be Like That, instead of always having to be like that -- then I think GM-less games, or playing in games GMed by other people, is going to be the best training for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334129/#Comment_334129" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T18:38:18+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  6:38PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Play PTA for a while.

I'm talking more about metagame decisions on where the game should go.<br/><br/>We're very open about discussing the game and the ongoing story at the table.  Here's a snippet from our first and best Burning Wheel game.<br/><br/>The players performed a coup, slaughtering their Duke and eventually rallied support of several prominent factions of the city, the people followed.<br/><br/>We were trying to decide where our game would go from here and how we would re-write beliefs.  We could have ended the story there but we all felt there something greater still in store. <br/><br/>We decided to push the game towards a quest for a legendary item which ended up being a Horn that when blown would call the Elves from across the sea and bring them to aid the realm of man which was crumbling from a demon at the core of the world that was bleeding darkness that spread across the land (along with armies of Orcs).<br/><br/>One player suggested something like going to kill the Demon.  These were 4 lifepath characters about 6 sessions in, so I suggested that was a bit out of their reach.  <br/><br/>One player suggested they look for a fabled sword or other weapon which I felt was a bit cliche.<br/><br/>After a good ten or fifteen minutes of discussion I thought of the Horn idea and thought it wasn't too bad.  The other players grabbed on and the campaign rode out to an amazing conclusion.<br/><br/>We have a lot of discussions like this about less important details.  In a recent game a merchant ship disappeared off the coast and I threw out the question, "Anyone want a friend or relative aboard to tie themselves into the situation?"  <br/><br/>One player suggested his brother was aboard.  I thought that was awesome and asked what he'd be doing aboard the ship.  Someone else suggested he was booking passage and I said, "Hmm I dunno.  It's a merchant ship so there probably wouldn't be any/many passengers aboard.  What if he's a crew member?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334208/#Comment_334208" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T09:34:16+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  9:34AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>How do I phrase a veto that would be socially acceptable among people I don't know well?</blockquote>\nI'm usually reluctant to veto as well, but sometimes I ...<br/>a) question the crap out of them. Our differences may boil down to a difference in what we're imagining, and once we're on the same page no problem. "Didn't we already establish that it's a merchant ship?" "I thought you were in different rooms - how do you kill him from all the way over there?" "I thought Joe didn't know that Carla was a witch - why is he doing this?" Not a veto per se, but maybe they'll change their contribution or clarify so I get it.<br/>b) use some stock phrases:  "I don't see it."  "Can you try a different way?" "I'm okay with that, if ..." - you don't have to be playing one of those ritual-phrases games to use their ritual phrases ... they just won't have mechanical weight.<br/>c) use lines or veils beforehand - "No children. No shit jokes."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334455/#Comment_334455" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T09:16:13+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  9:16AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2011 9:21AM by Todd_L.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            agony,<br/><br/>You have a "strong vision" to "produce fiction".  There's nothing wrong with that goal.  So ignore those who say it's wrongbadfun:\n<blockquote>you're saying, "When we engage in a semi-structured group play activity, I want [my memory of play] to be comparable to items of heavily crafted individual art."<p>That is a crazy thing to ask for. You have to stop asking for it.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>I don't want me games to be literature.  I want them to remind me of literature but to ask for our table's product to be some kind of edited, re-written text sounds like putting contact poison in everyone's dice bag to me.</blockquote>\nInstead, focus on how to achieve your 'produce fiction' goal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>you say things like "Yeah, that's pretty good, but..."<br/><br/>Is that even a Veto?  A veto is a 'no'. You're prompting players to make a second suggestion, and go with whichever one's better.<br/>(Which is, if you look closely, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">less</span> of a Veto than the story-games-approved technique of "Try a different way."  Try a different way does veto the first suggestion.)<br/><br/>David Mamet says the first suggestion offered will be the mind's brown-nosing attempt to be liked, by blurting the Teacher's Pet 'right' answer (pandering for social approval), or by blurting clich\xe9 (repeating what you've seen TV, movies, books do before, rather than answering the question as if it were the first time it had ever been asked.)     Mamet advises getting past the initial lazy answers to Produce Good Fiction.<br/><br/>You want to get-to the point where your &amp; your players' answers aren't about your Selves...<br/>but about the subconscious tackling the task at-hand: answers which best match the question, rather than suit the answerer.<br/><br/>So, 'yeah that's pretty good, but...' is actually good technique.    It coaxes out a second reply, while putting the ego in as little defensive posture as possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You don't 100% agree with Graham's statement from Play Unsafe which states something like "Don't try to be brilliant, be obvious." <br/><br/>Mamet gives the same advice to actors... but not to screenwriters or directors.  Plays and movies have a division of labor which allows that.<br/><br/>You could adopt a similar division of labor, where you take responsibility for being brilliant, and the players execute it.  But you'll be violating story games sacred cows if you do so,<br/>so you may not find much help here in figuring out ways to do that well.<br/><br/><br/>Also, be aware that 'brilliant' and 'obvious' are a false dichotomy.   It's the 'trying' [too hard] part, that's the problem.  <br/><br/>I am a broken record about recommending David Mamet's book "On Directing Film", but it does directly address the issues of this thread, minus the conclusion that it's 'impossible'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334470/#Comment_334470" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T11:00:51+00:00" title="July 14, 2011 11:00AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles,<br/><br/>What you wrote when you explained how these conversation went doesn't sound like a veto at all but a frank and honest discussion about what interests everyone about the game.<br/><br/>What I wrote above is a response to the idea of someone vetoing someone else's choices at the table in the name of art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334492/#Comment_334492" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T12:41:58+00:00" title="July 14, 2011 12:41PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I can definitely see how I was misleading.<br/><br/>I guess it feels like a veto to me because I find myself saying, "That's cool, but..." very often.

I'm talking more about metagame decisions on where the game should go.<br/><br/>We're very open about discussing the game and the ongoing story at the table.  . . .<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>After a good ten or fifteen minutes of discussion I thought of the Horn idea and thought it wasn't too bad.  The other players grabbed on and the campaign rode out to an amazing conclusion.<br/><br/>I don't really see a problem with this.  When I GM, I usually don't veto ideas so much as offer to the players in-game information that their characters should be aware of that illustrates why something isn't a good idea.  If a player is interested in exploring an idea, we often do it through roleplaying with NPCs.  In fact, NPCs are an excellent means for introducing the GM's voice into the party.  At times, I've included an NPC in a game in a support role (i.e. healer, sage, guide, etc.) just so that I as the GM can have a specific voice and point of view in party discussions.<br/><br/>For instance, a player suggests looking for a powerful, ancient sword.  Who knows about such artifacts?  They go to a sage who says he doesn't know anything about a sword but there is the tale of the Elfen Horn.<br/><br/>The key distinction in all of this being that you can encourage players to reject ideas for in game reasons rather than just rejecting an idea outright from behind the GM screen.  The disadvantage of this is that it can take more time before you move into the action of a quest.  But, it has the added benefit of further developing the campaign setting and potentially uncovering something of interest that hooks the players.  Something that you may not have thought of before or that you threw in simply for color.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>Yeah, but what about vetoing without a solution? I don't always have a better idea (sometimes I do). </blockquote>\nThis is where delay can be your friend.  Though I'm increasingly biased toward active games that maintain forward momentum, sometimes it is good to pause and think things through.  That can include taking the time between sessions to work on a solution.  You can avoid making the call right away by either ending the session or by focusing on another aspect of the campaign or having an encounter until it is time to wrap up for the night.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>In a recent game a merchant ship disappeared off the coast and I threw out the question, "Anyone want a friend or relative aboard to tie themselves into the situation?"<br/><br/>One player suggested his brother was aboard.  I thought that was awesome and asked what he'd be doing aboard the ship.  Someone else suggested he was booking passage and I said, "Hmm I dunno.  It's a merchant ship so there probably wouldn't be any/many passengers aboard.  What if he's a crew member?"</blockquote>\nI like the idea of increasing the drama by inviting the players to add a personal angle to a situation.<br/><br/>But, you're wrong on the facts here.  My understanding is that at pretty much anytime prior to WWII, and frequently thereafter, merchant ships also carried some passengers.  After all, a captain would be interested in making the additional money.  The idea of a ship that only carries passengers, is pretty much a product of the 20th Century.

I mean if I were at a table and Anna said the first thing, I would automatically assume she (probably without even noticing) means the second thing.  But I've been at tables where Bob doesn't make that same assumption and so kind of shuts down with some version of "oh I guess I don't know what I do then".  That's why the "Negotiation" step comes before the "Bidding" step in Universalis, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334916/#Comment_334916" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T11:20:28+00:00" title="July 17, 2011 11:20AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's true! Both Bob and Anna have control in the situation. Often the first thing people say (without editing) isn't exactly what they mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation could just as easily go this way...<br/>\n<br/>\nBob: "I cut deep into the alien with my sword."<br/>\nAnna: "Veto! You can't do that, we established that the alien's skin is too thick to cut through!"<br/>\nBob: "But I'm not cutting into the alien's skin... I'm cutting into its eyes where the skin won't protect it. Is that still a veto?"<br/>\nAnna: "Oh! That's cool."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sometimes only takes 1 person to try to reach mutual understanding. And both Bob and Anna are in the position to turn the situation into a win / win for everyone<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, it can be exhausting for both sides. Anna could be a person who finds that sharing anything other than her unfiltered thoughts is tiring, regardless how anyone else might react. Where Bob could find it tiring controlling his own feelings and trying not to take offense or being sensitive at Anna's bluntness while trying to figure out what would appease her. Either way, one or two situations is not a big deal. But if you get people with incompatible communication styles going back and forth over 2-4 hours, playing games could go from energizing to draining.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a balance between logic and emotion. Tone conveying emotion can matter more than the details of what is communicated because if tone causes people to shut down, then they won't listen to the logic that follows. That said, I'm sensitive to all this because I spend a lot of time professionally mediating different personality types and modes of communication. It's one of the reasons I love GMing, it puts me in a position to smooth over different styles of communication between players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334944/#Comment_334944" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T16:27:04+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  4:27PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2011 4:28PM by Graham.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think vetoing is, perhaps, the wrong focus.<br><br>Conversations about genre-appropriateness can be great.

Establish expectations</b>:  Collectively we lay enough groundwork before a campaign begins, so that the players (including myself) collectively grasp what sort of game/campaign/story we're interested in creating.  This is merely the first step.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>2.  The Pilot:</b>  Allow for a degree of a few sessions for the group to play through the idea from inception to game table.  Along the way, you will all discover what works and what does not.  I'm currently running a Space Opera campaign that mimics a televisual format.  As a result, we've just got through our four-session 'pilot'.  By the end of this we have found character voices and campaign voice for the game.  Everyone is on-board, fun is being had, the Universe feels consistent with genre and has twists upon them that are understood and accepted by the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>3.  Remember your roles</b>:  Once the pilot and those few sessions are played out, players and GM alike have established precedents and expectations to consider when gaming.  To either adhere to, or break said roles within the context of exceptional circumstance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works for us.  And literally I'd be writing fiction if I wanted to 'veto' every player action.

Things making sense in the fiction would presumably be far below the baseline being discussed.<br><br>Of course I can still see phrasing being important, and the 'ask questions' method might still work -- but they wouldn't be questions that appeal to the logic of the story or rhetorically remind people of pre-establish facts. They'd be things like:<br><br>Bob: "I stab the alien with my sword, cutting deep into its flesh!"<br>Anna: "Are you sure killing the alien now is the best idea, given that Frank's PC only just let it loose [and we haven't yet seen the repercussions of that action?]"<br><br>In the genre or consistency-based examples there's less need for the part in brackets, because generally everyone is pretty good at inferring appropriate/possible results once you remind them of the fictional logic involved. But when what you are appealing to is something like 'their sense of what would be a cool story' I am guessing it becomes a lot harder to pretend your questions are not primarily rhetorical.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334980/#Comment_334980" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T22:02:15+00:00" title="July 17, 2011 10:02PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion is now putting me in mind of <i>Ask Culture Vs.

And she would die if you got a pony.<br>(She can't simply tell the truth, because that would expose Daddy's shameful failing as a breadwinner.)     <br>AND, if Mommy simply said 'no' to you--her precious little baby-- that might forever damage your self-esteem and well-being!<br><br><br><br>So.

But the diplomacy can't interfere with clarity. But I do think the emotions at the table are important. I agree with Judd, I think there are middle grounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nBad dice rolls are interesting in that they can be buzzkills (depending on the system, some games reward failure or make failure interesting) but dice also provide a sense of distance. The people at the table aren't responsible, the dice are. So even if there is frustration, you can be frustrated together! In D&amp;D;, sometimes the bad dice rolls are unfairly blamed on the DM because they are the messenger (telling you difficulties, if you hit or missed, rolling against you). That's another reason why Apocalypse World is so fascinating. The players roll everything and know all their odds. I've seen AW players roll terribly and have horrible things happen to their character but feel completely ok with it because of how the mechanic works.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I haven't yet read the links your provided but will!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335004/#Comment_335004" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T05:43:07+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  5:43AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not rejecting all the fine work people have done-- seeking ways to lubricate touchy situations.<br>Those tools are useful.<br><br>I'm just offering a grain of salt-- a counterpoint.<br><br/>I'm agreeing that a table where hard vetoes are frequent-- MAY have big social problems.<br/><br/>But, I'm also saying that a table where No can be used freely-- is also an ideal to aspire to.<br/><br/>After all, if the social contract is truly healthy and well-established; then everybody should be in agreement<br/>about What We Are All Here To Do...    and they should be able to see how the No works for that greater good,<br/>without fearing that the No brings a pandora's box of hidden baggage.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/><br/>Since Guess Culture -does- exist, I am wary that the true dangers of Vetoing are conflated with<br/>the neurotic aspects of Guess Culture thinking:  So that a whole table-- or local play culture-- might<br/>find itself tied in knots from trying to accommodate a person who is allergic to hearing No. <br/>Meanwhile, the simpler solution might be to teach that person how to hear No constructively, instead of taking offense.<br/><br/><br/><br/>John, <br/>if you do tackle that first link-- the thread actually begins far up the page with a guy asking a how to decline an unwanted houseguest.
