                    This is my first post here so I hope this is in the right place. <br/><br/>Over on my LiveJournal, <a href="http://mike-montesa.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mike-montesa.livejournal.com/</a> I moan and groan about WW2 RPGs. You can look at that entry but I'll repeat it here:<br/><br/>As far as I can recall, between the release of Behind Enemy Lines in 1983 and 1998, when Saving Private Ryan got people interested in WW2 "again," there were no other WW2 RPGs, and it wasn't until 2001 that a wave of WW2 RPGs hit the beaches. GURPS World War Two, Godlike, and  Weird Wars all hit at roughly the same time.<br/><br/>There have been some WW2 products released for D20, but you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who even knows about them, or even played them.<br/><br/>Now of course, if things go well, this year will see the release of my own Savage Worlds: Weird War Two, which adapts the original PEG WW2 setting for their Savage Worlds game.<br/><br/>Now that's all well and good. I love WW2 RPGs and buy 'em whenever I see them. But one thing they all have in common, which I think limits the possibilities for play in some cases is, at their heart, they are wargames, and the only thing missing from most of them that removes them from playing Advanced Squad Leader is a hex map (which they may very well use anyway!)<br/><br/>Now, I have played Advanced Squad Leader and I like it. When I play it I can concentrate soley on tactics and the interaction and capabilities of weapon systems, and utterly remove myself from any emotional investment in the cardboard lives I'm flinging into the meatgrinder. But when I play RPGs, I really like to go for a "you are there" sort of experience. With many WW2 RPGs, the moment you slap down a map or set up for a firefight, face it, you are playing a wargame, and if I'm gonna do that to be quite honest, I'd rather play ASL.<br/><br/>Just look at the best WW2 movies out there. They focus on the characters and what the war does to them. They focus on the stresses of leadership. The best of them allow the audience to connect with the characters and experience their struggles, and although it's impossible to actually understand what battle is like without actually being in one, give you and idea of what it's like. They aren't paeons to equipment.<br/><br/>But I wonder if this can be done. A lot of people want to compare the penetration values of the U.S. 76mm gun vs. the German 75L40. They want to see how the Zero could twist around like a cat in a sack. If this is so, any one of the many true wargames dedicated to that subject will do a much better job of giving them that experience than any WW2 RPG out there.<br/><br/>What I want is a WW2 RPG that takes the emphasis off machinery and moving it around, and puts it squarely on the individual soldiers and how they deal with the stress, chaos, and horror of battle. I also want something that brings the chain of command and the responsibilities of leadership into play. In the end, this is what it is all about. Your equipment may be shit hot, but in the end, it always comes down to who is using it and how they use it.<br/><br/>Now, I started a similar thread on RPG, and checked out the game <i>Unsung</i> that was recommended to me there, which almost gave me what I wanted. It was missing something, though I'm still not sure what.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd just like to hear what people want out of a WW2 RPG - a simpler version of ASL for roleplayers? An examination of what it means to be in command?<br/><br/>Also looking for some encouragement to try and develop my ideas for this a bit further. ;-)                </div>

                            Woah, I was reading the first 2/3 of your post thinking "Unsung, Unsung, Unsung"... Do you know what it didn't quite do for you?  Was it too "Vietnam" and not enough "WWII"? I know that you're into the lighter games like PTA/The Mountain Witch so that's probably not the issue (not enough crunch), but I'm wondering if you could give some thought over the next few days of what you'd like to see in those WW2 games.  Because there's a lot of games in dev right now, some or one of which may be dealing with those issues you want to explore or find missing...<br/>

                            Here's a little mechanic I came up with last week. I didn't think I would have a use for it, but this seems to be the perfect thread.<br/>
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
- During battle, soldiers accumulate Horror.<br/>
<br/>
- During interlude scenes (downtime, travel, leave) a soldier can get rid of Horror points by talking with his comrades. Each question you ask (and get an answer to) turns one Horror point into one Trust point with that soldier.<br/>
<br/>
- For every battle a soldier survives, his comrades earn Duty points equal to the Trust they have invested in him. You can spend Duty to get bonus dice during conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
- When a soldier dies, everyone with Trust points with that soldier takes Horror equal to Trust x 2.<br/>
<br/>
- When your Horror total crosses certain thresholds, you suffer. One of the first problems is that you start refusing to talk to your comrades, denying them the chance to unload Horror by bonding with you.<br/>
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
That's all I have so far, but I think it has potential. It encourages the soldiers to chat about themselves and bond together, to try to keep each other alive, and to shut down and clam up when the horror becomes too great.                        </div>

                            Yeah, Andy, that may have been it. Perhaps I would have liked to see Unsung grounded more firmly in a particular setting (WW2).<br>
<br>
John, cool idea! Duly noted! :-) Now to work something out for things like leadership. But that all comes down to trust as well (the trust the men have in their leader). It's also a portion of skill as well. How do we figure that in?<br>
<br>
Also, I want to address the "equipment" issue without going the wargame route. I want to be able to say, "OK, Easy company is pinned down here by that Tiger sitting up the street. The only weapon you've got capable of damaging it is your bazooka but you're gonna have to get behind the Tiger to even have a chance." So the equipment matters, but not to the point where we're adding and subtracting modifiers, and measuring ranges and fire arcs on a hex map. All that really counts is whether or not you have a weapon that can do the job, and deliver that particular payload on target.<br>
<br>
That  Duty, Trust, and Horror mechanic is a good start though!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'd actually had unformed notions about Polaris cross my mind while thinking about this. ;-)<br>
<br>
I just downloaded and skimmed Carry, and it looks really cool. Hopefully I can give it a try sometime.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of vets telling the story in flashback is really cool, although obviously they have all survived their ordeal. Definitely something there however.                        </br></br></div>

                            I don't think the format presupposes survival.  Once you find out in play that you are, in fact, only a memory in the minds of the survivors, how does that change anything?                        </div>

                            Good point, Jason. You can also go the Band of Brothers route, and keep some suspense by not identifying the veterans until the last session.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really digging this idea of veteran flashbacks. It solves so many issues at once. Must mull over more...                        </div>

                            Hadn't thought of that (characters being only a memory in the minds of the survivors). Very cool and that actually opens up some interesting possibilities - how are characters who died remembered by the survivors? Did they go out doing something heroic, cowardly, or just get killed for no reason other than they were unlucky? There might even be some sort of "medium success" with guys who survived the war but passed away before the "reunion" where the vets are getting together to swap war stories.<br>
<br>
And the Polaris idea, hmm... <br/>
<br/>
"We were assigned to..."<br/>
"You remember that guy....from....?"<br/>
"That's not how I remember it..."<br/>
"He's right..."<br/>
"Then the most incredible thing happened..."<br/>
"He was the bravest man I ever knew..."<br/>
"We would have followed him to hell and back..."<br/>
"I don't know how I/he/we survived but..."<br/>
"I don't know what happened to him..."<br/>
"I was there when he died..."<br/>
"You weren't there..."                        </br></br></div>

                            Whoa. Craziness. Some great ideas in here, Mike.<br/><br/>If you're interested, my <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18469.0" rel="nofollow">Carry AP thread</a> is generating some cool thoughts about flashbacks and various ways to work with those in the context. I'm grooving on how a game could be broken into two parts, the first being the flashbacks, which you play through until you get to the current moment, with the characters are reminiscing for whatever reason, and then the second part plays linearly from there. So they might not survive.<br/><br/>Also, Polaris-esque ritual phrases would be awesome. Some thoughts to add to your list:<br/><br/>"I wish I had died..."<br/>"I forgave him..."<br/>"The most fucked-up thing..."                        </div>

                            Still thinking on this. Going back to one of my original thoughts, if most currently available WW2 RPGs are only a hex map removed from ASL, do you think that means this is the style of WW2 game people want, or is it just what they expect and are used to?<br/>
<br/>
Do people think the market is more receptive to that kind of game than one which puts the focus squarely on the characters?                        </div>

                            Oh yeah.  The great thing about WW2 is that pretty much everybody can jump right in, based on media they've already been exposed to.  I don't think stylistic choices enter into it - if you build a character-focused game about WW2 dudes, people will at least be comfortable with the setting.  Unless it's about playing Polish Boy Scouts and Girl Guides looking for romance during the Warsaw uprising or something.                        </div>

                            Had an inspiration while moonlighting on my second job today. Started jotting down stuff and a few things started to come together. Hopefully this will produce something playable in short order.                        </div>

                            I love the fact that there are hundreds of people all over the world jotting notes catch-as-catch-can during their work day, scribbling ideas for games.  One guy on these forums does it aboard airplanes flying to and fro.  <br/><br/>can't wait to see what you come up with, Mike.                        </div>

                            I jot my ideas for games sitting in a coffee shop in front of Victoria Harbor, looking out of Hong Kong past the statue of Bruce Lee.<br/>
<br/>
I have no regrets.  Except missing the train.<br/>
