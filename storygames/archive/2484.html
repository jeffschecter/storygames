                    Not sure if this has been brought up before, or if it even belongs in this category, but here goes anyway. <br/><br/>I recently ran an attempt at a Sorcerer game set in colonial America, specifically right around the time of the Salem witch trials, and it sort of failed. Partly because I didn't have a good firm grasp on Sorcerer (and quite possibly still don't), and partly because I was consistantly letting players join and leave at a whim, to the point where there were actually 11 player characters involved in said story. As I look back on it, I realized that the whole thing I created in my notes and in my head weren't cohesive at all to allowing people to just randomly add and remove their characters. I wanted to focus on just the few characters we had at the start but, since I'm a nice guy, wasn't willing to turn people away at the time. I have since learned my lesson, I think, and hopefully this won't happen again.<br/><br/>So I guess the first question I have is this; are there games out there that don't tend to work out, in any situation (extended or short play) when player characters are suddenly added or removed between sessions or during play? <br/><br/>My second question relates to the first: Have any of you had any situations come up where the addition or sudden loss of a player character has caused a storyline to cave in on itself? For this one, I think I should be specific and say that I'm not talking about situations about disruptive players or non-cohesive characters. I'm referring to the odd situation where the character in question doesn't seem like it will be disruptive by entering or leaving the story, but then as the story unfolds, it falls on its face. <br/><br/>Tim                </div>

                            Hmm. <br/><br/>Well, this is probably gonna be subject to lots of personal preferences and such... but I generally don't have players add in the middle of any tightly run campaign. Sorcerer with 11 people scares me, and with people coming and going I can't see any way that my R Map wouldn't be swiss cheese within days. The web of relationships and such that you build, and the way the kickers drive the story, just don't seem conducive to adding or subtracting characters randomly. You're pretty much adding and subtracting the biggest and most important elements in your story, and if that's done at logical places (when kickers are resolved, for example) it makes sense, but done suddenly... yea.                        </div>

                            There are, in my experience, <b>lots</b> of games which don't tend to work out when player characters are suddenly added or removed between sessions or during play.  So many that it still wouldn't be worth the time to list them even if you could separate instances of "this particular storyline/plot/whatever collapses if the characters involved are removed and new characters added" from the equation.<br/><br/>I'd say that it's more important to think of the game you're actually running and determine whether <i>that specific game</i> (storyline, system, etc.) is set up to accomodate new PCs bopping in and out of the story at will.  Some stories could easily support that with a minimum of handwaving, others won't ever manage it even if you poured all your effort into trying to make it work.  Some systems can easily support it (fast and easy character generation, troupe mechanics, etc.), others can't.  And honestly, some <i>people</i> can easily support it, while others simply can't: I could never, ever, EVER run a game with 11 players in it, and I sincerely doubt I could even <i>play</i> in one.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, it sounds like you learned the most important lesson: saying "sorry, I'm afraid I can't fit any more players into this game" to people when you genuinely can't fit any more players in is really difficult, but it has to be done.  Given what you've just experienced, you'll have better luck next time, I guarantee it!  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Right, it's much easier to come up with an example of a game that doesn't work out with changing gaming group than with a game that does (or at least have a chance to).<br/><br/>Actually, I can think only of two examples (might be just my incompetence, you never know). The first one is a simple game I've been designing before my mind slipped towards other things, it was about goblinoids who are mutating creatures in my setting, so every adventure would start with all the players (all who show up) rolling up new characters who are either mutated versions of the old ones or their children. The second example is a pbp diceless (rules-less? I don't know the right English term for "rpg with no game system behind it whatsoever", sorry) game which is just about to start with me as a GM. It's based on Hunter Ã— Hunter where it is possible for some main heroes to die and for others to replace them, so in game practice that'd mean that any time a player is "lost", his or her character is "lost" too. Pretty impudent way to do it, and it won't fit into just every game.                        </div>

                            I would say that most games will not support players coming in and going out, unless you think ahead of time and plan for that contingency.<br/><br/>Sorceror seems to me peculiarly ill-suited for this, given that it aims to provide conflicts that resonate at the player level, which must be hard if the players change week to week.<br/><br/>The thing is, whether you go for conflict driven play, dynamic situations into which you throw the PCs, prestructured plots that the PCs move through or whatever none of these things will cope well if the main protagonists keep changing.<br/><br/>Unless that is you plan from the outset to consider how the conflicts may alter, situation may change or plot may flex to cope with characters coming in and going out.  And that will be specific to the particular game planned.<br/><br/>But generally, I would have thought any game aiming at some kind of thematic significance to the actual players would be damaged by players changing week to week, whereas by contrast a game aimed at simulating the life of a tramp steamer in 1930s South-East Asia could probably cope fairly easily with characters coming in and going out.                        </div>

                            In general, I think most games don't do too well with a changing mix of players, unless that's something that is built into those sessions of play from the start. Many of the focused, thematic games build on a strong base of player participation and creativity, so changing that base can be very destabliziing.<br/><br/>I'm going to throw a couple of counter-examples out there, tho I don't know if you're looking for games that do support having players drop in and out. <br/><br/>One of my favorite games totally and completely supports a rotating cast of characters (and thus, of players): <a href="http://www.nightskygames.com/" rel="nofollow">1001 Nights</a>. Also, Primetime Adventures could work, if you go from the start with the understanding that there will be a number of Guest Stars who may or may not be in every episode. In the Mountain Witch game I'm currently running, I had one player who couldn't attend the second session, and he ended the first session by having his character fall down an ice chute into the bowels of Mt. Fuji, off-screening himself in advance.<br/><br/>I hope some of that helps.                        </div>

                            I haven't had any problems like this for some time, but I've found ways to structure around it.  I no longer structure a game such that the loss of one or two characters would be the downfall of a game.  Experience has taught me that you never know when a new job, romantic interest, or other event might cause a player to drop out of a game.<br/><br/>Here are a few thoughts:<br/><br/>If a character is gone temporarily:<br/>* Do a flashback session.  Alternatively, play the bad guys or characters in the distant future.  All of these things can continue to develop the current story and don't require a specific character to be present.<br/>* Throw out several side hooks, such as an old friend coming back from out of town.<br/>* Just don't include material that requires the presence of that character.<br/>* Run the character as an NPC.<br/><br/>If a character is gone permanently:<br/>* Shift current, important plots to other PCs where possible.<br/>* Allow arcs specific to that character to fall away.  If you hit the other characters with interesting arcs at the same time the players wont even notice.<br/>* Run the character as an NPC.                        </div>

                            IIRC, Spirit of the Century was specifically designed to handle a rotating cast of characters, pulling from a larger pool of characters for any given week.<br/><br/>My Etherscope game suffers from PC bloat now and again - we started with 5 and seem to have grown and grown to 8, which is unwieldy at times. Luckily (?) it's a rare week that we have everyone turn up, but when they do it can hurt!                        </div>

During my Mountain Witch game, I was abruptly faced with losing a player at the end of the penultimate session.  I was sadly concluding that we would have to just kill off her character and lose some of the fun entanglements that the character had been providing, when the player came up with a brilliant plan.  Her character was in an uneasy and shifting relationship with a demon, so at the end of the third session, Hannah orchestrated it so that her player finally lost control to the demon.  This allowed Robert to step in as her character for the last session, now playing the demon who'd disguised himself as Hannah's PC.  She briefed him on the plot, etc. prior to the final session, and it all went smashingly.                        </div>

Was it?  I don't actually own a copy but from actual play I would say that it's admirably suited to long-term play, but with a high degree of character flexibility.                        </div>

                            I get the sense that variable casts are not really a big deal if you plan for them. We've run Roanoke a few times with only a few players the same.  I've done the same with Nobilis, Primetime Adventures, and The Shadow of Yesterday in the past.  You can't really have a pre-determined GM-driven plot, but that's easy enough.  You just need a few open-ended situations that are developing and let whichever players are there focus on dealing with them.  It's like being part of a large ensemble cast.                        </div>
