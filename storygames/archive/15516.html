I'm only about halfway through Wulin, but it is an interesting step forward in at least some ways.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, prose quality is not one of them.  Weapons of the Gods was a real treat to read, full of well-written kung-fu duels of words and wits, and the lack of Jenna Moran's zippy dialogue makes all of Wulin's flavor text a boring slog I started skimming quickly.  This is especially depressing in the bits that are just paraphrases of lengthier and more memorable passages from WotG, like the Bedroom Alchemy stuff. There's also no authorial voice whatsoever to the overall text, which makes all the setting and NPC descriptions the same dull-ass "cramming for a fake history test" chore that stops me from reading most setting-heavy RPGs these days.  And despite all this, they did not fix WotG's arguably biggest problem-- the Loresheets are still tightly integrated with the worldbuilding, so you still need to read the entire book cover to cover to make a character as intended.<br/><br/>But that's the bad.  There is most definitely good too!  The system is still complex, but they seem to have moved the crunchiness over to tactical options rather than just point-counting, and taken a lot of inspiration from FATE and Cortex+.  The basic die mechanic is the same and the River (space to store extra dice for future rolls) is still in, but stats and skills are basically gone-- you have a standard die pool that you roll for everything (based on your level; I think the default newbie PC pool is 7), and skills are just a +5 or +10 bonus on relevant if you have the skill instead of extra dice (and something akin to Exalted Stunting is in; every fu style has things it Laughs At and things it Fears, and if you can narrate in your style's strength and/or your opponent's weakness, you get another +5 bonus each). <br/><br/>You still spend Chi points to fuel effects, but now it's one generic pool instead of five different elemental ones with independent refresh rates (you can buy elementally-aspected chi pools in addition, but now they are an advanced add-on instead of something everyone has to track).  Movement is no longer measured in yards-- now everything is a Fate-style Zone, where everyone within a Zone is fair game for attacks, you only roll to move between Zones, and some kung fu lets you attack people in other Zones.  It is also easier to take multiple actions per turn; while you only get one attack, if you have extra matched sets on your initiative or attack roll you can essentially spend them to take minor actions that don't do damage, like healing a friend, recovering your Chi faster, moving between zones, knocking over a mountain to block the archers' line of sight, etc.  The timing on that is a little weird though, I need to study that section more.<br/><br/>The L5R-style HP-based wound levels are gone too-- "damage" is now just Chi Conditions (so if someone smacks you, you basically get the "broken arm" Aspect instead of HP damage), and in a Smallville-esque bit, if someone rolls super well while inflicting a Condition, you get knocked out of the fight (and small Conditions can be aggravated by taking more damage, until it gets bad enough to knock you out).  This has the side effect of making the Secret Arts (the way WotG put Chi Conditions on people) the main resolution system instead of a weird awesome outlier.  Each method of "combat" (actual combat, sorcery, medicine/alchemy/poisons, social combat, tactical maneuvering) has its<br/>own set of appropriate attack and defense rolls, applicable equipment for bonuses/penalties, and theme of conditions they can apply (so no breaking an arm with sorcery, or making someone's broken arm worse), so they all use the same basic resolution system, but hopefully feel different enough in practice to avoid the problem I ended up having with Anima Prime, of everything feeling like a reskin of the one basic move.  We'll see.<br/><br/>The XP system is also pretty cool; the GM hands out XP (Destiny) like usual, for just showing up and also for recognizing great Deeds of kung fu-- but each player can also recognize another player's Deed and award Destiny too.  And each Destiny reward also comes with an equal amount of Destiny THAT THE PERSON WHO AWARDED IT CHOOSES HOW TO SPEND.  So basically the game is full of stuff like "You totally kicked those bandits' asses, I'm giving you a Deed of Valor and also giving you a new Sidekick-- you impressed one of those bandits so much he renounces evil and starts following you around."<br/><br/>So yeah, while the actual book is I think a lesser work than Weapons of the Gods, Legends of the Wulin might possibly be a better game.  Mind, I haven't gotten to the actual Kung Fu styles yet, and that's a section of crunch that may make or break the book.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351789/#Comment_351789" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-17T14:07:22+00:00" title="December 17, 2011  2:07PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

That was always the heart of the game for us.</blockquote>\nSo I'm about 2/3 through now; finished the Kung Fu section and just starting Secret Arts proper.<br/><br/>Now, it's been a while since I last read WotG, and I actually don't have my copy close at hand, but I do have the Companion around, and looking at the new fu styles in there generally agrees with my memory that kung fu styles were heavily exception-based; pretty much every style had totally unique effects for most of its techniques.  Wulin's kung fu is a lot more templated; most of the techniques are very similar between styles, and many of them are "get a +whatever bonus to Strike/Damage/whatever".  <br/><br/>Styles are now divided between External (combat/nonmagical) and Internal (support/magical).  Characters all start with one External and one Internal style.  External styles actually sort of fill the role of equipment; their main use is the set of inherent bonuses they provide to your combat rolls, and then their individual techniques usually but not always boil down to a permanent increase to one of those bonuses.  Weapons actually are sort of similar, and are very abstracted; they consist of a set of tags (Flexible, Massive, Ranged, Sword, and so on), and each tag has its own set of combat bonuses (much less comprehensive than the ones you get from kung fu) and some other kind of benny (Ranged weapons let you attack outside your Zone, a Staff will let you make an extra attack, etc), which stack with the bonuses you get from compatible External Styles (some styles don't use Swords or Unarmed, and so on).  It is possible to put multiple tags on a weapon; like, the classic whip-style flying sleeves would be Flexible and possibly Paired or Ranged depending on how your character fights with them.<br/><br/>Internal Styles are more like WotG's version of fu, and unlike External Styles, their techniques cost Chi points to use.  They're still more uniform in design than WotG styles, but at least part of that is because some effects are just more common than they used to be; like, setting people on fire, freezing them with ice or shocking them with lightning now have standardized effects, so it's easier to just say "this style uses Fire Energy Attacks" instead of giving every flame style a different way to burn people.  That said, there's still some wiggle room; there are styles that start out as "this uses Poison Attacks" and then additional techniques add extra effects on top of the basic Poison Attack-- and of course, there are some styles that are totally unique and don't use any templated effects.<br/><br/>It is also apparently impossible for one person to totally master an Internal Style; they each have eleven different Techniques, and you can only choose three (you get five total, but the first and last ones are the fundamentals of the style and never vary). Many (but not all) are redundant, though; for example, most of the elemental styles have multiple "shoot element/resist element" techniques (that is, there's a shoot fire path and an ignore fire path) staggered through the school, that only differ in the exact bonuses granted to the roll, so you can either learn to shoot fire/resist fire early and have that be a consistent part of your style, or you can wait to learn that technique and have it be extra effective due to the time you spent learning it.  But again, not every school is designed like that-- some don't have any redundant effects at all.  I suppose this is meant to provide some potential variety if everyone picks the same Internal Style.<br/><br/>(edit: there are some Loresheets that let you learn more Internal techniques than would normally be allowed-- incentive to get tangled up with mysterious sifu and warring schools, I guess.  Also, someone was kind enough to type up <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?604401-Legends-of-the-Wulin-discussion-thread-part-III-The-Smiling-Proud-World-of-Wulin!&amp;p=14795841#post14795841" rel="nofollow">the one-line descriptions of all the External and Internal styles</a>)<br/><br/>So in general, the Kung Fu styles have lost some of their complexity and possibly depth (though they're still complex enough that you're going to want all of these different bonuses written down on your sheet), but a good portion of what they've lost has been redistributed into other parts of the system, like choosing when to split your die pool to take or oppose minor actions (at the risk of making your primary attack easier to defend against), use the effects from your weapon tags, and the increased emphasis on using and inflicting Chi Conditions.  Speaking of which, I wonder just how many Conditions the average character is going to have on them, given that literally every damage roll in the game has a chance of inflicting one; it's possible that characters might have so many tacked on that it gets unwieldy to remember just what taboos and geasa you have to obey to gain or avoid die modifiers, but I suppose that's the kind of thing that'd only become clear in actual play.<br/><br/>I do think I'll try and get a group together to try this soonish, but I'd definitely need to bang together a quick-reference sheet.  And finish reading the book, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351939/#Comment_351939" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T13:03:55+00:00" title="December 19, 2011  1:03PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2011 11:44PM by Anarchangel.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there no QRS in the book or on the website?<br/><br/>[Fixed typo]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351957/#Comment_351957" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T15:29:56+00:00" title="December 19, 2011  3:29PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh goodness no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351978/#Comment_351978" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T18:35:53+00:00" title="December 19, 2011  6:35PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (what's a QRF?)<br/><br/>Also, thank you for the review! WOTG was one of my favorite games filled with awesome ideas and rules quirks that was impossible to play because of the sheer amount of work needed to make a character: The Lore Sheet concept is a brilliant way to create deep characters, tied to the setting. But as it, it means you need to read hundreds and hundreds of pages to decide which ones to take/use (as the book had no quick run-down or summary of the sheets, nor were there any "quick play combos" of lore sheet builds for ready-to-go-characters). It was just one of the few things that made the game really really really hard to run if you didn't have time to read hundreds of pages, or were not involved in the development.<br/><br/>...the other part that was super-hard to understand was the Secret Arts concept.

I ended up buying the PDF (splitting the funds about 6 ways with my gaming group members), but won't have a chance to go through it deeply for a bit.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351993/#Comment_351993" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T21:47:17+00:00" title="December 19, 2011  9:47PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a WotG campaign for a while, but it ended up being kind of a huge pain in the ass and after a while I couldn't take it anymore. This was down to a few factors, the biggest of which was probably that it was a monthly game, and every session we probably spent an hour or so going over the rules. Not all at once, mind you -- parceled out over the course of a few hours. I wasn't the only one with the book, but I was definitely the only one who paid significant attention to it between sessions on a regular basis. I was pretty active on the Eos forums, making up new kung-fu styles, rewriting the weapon table, etc. (Y'know, the stuff that a lot of people did on the Eos forums back then.) <br/><br/>But the Lore Sheets were definitely another stumbling block. Only players who owned the book had a fightin' chance of reading them -- and we damn sure weren't going to take up valuable gaming time passing our two or three books around so everyone could read every Lore Sheet to see what interested them -- which meant that they pretty much didn't get read. So anything I introduced to them from the setting as-written was both news to them and something it would've been cool for them to interact with mechanically but which they couldn't because they hadn't spent points on it.<br/><br/>It's a frustrating thing I've found with Shen-Zhou and some other cool settings (Sundered Skies and Kerberos Club spring to mind) where, as the GM, I'm like, "This is awesome!" but in play it all ends up being the equivalent of an origin story. The players get introduced to new things, but if you want to be subtle about leveraging those things you have to wait several sessions for it to really mean something to them. And several sessions is not a luxury I can usually afford (or even have available).<br/><br/>Plus two of the four PCs were Secret Arts guys, and nobody ever knew how the fuck that worked, so it was a little... halting, let's say. What finally killed it, though, was the realization that it was "All aboard the Campaign Train!" I'd planned too much and hand't left room for the PCs to breathe. That, combined with everything else, convinced me to cut it short.<br/><br/>There were a lot of things I liked about the system, though -- it was my first exposure to an ORE-style dice mechanic, for example -- so I'm eager to check out Legends of the Wulin. Everything I've heard about it sounds pretty intriguing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352028/#Comment_352028" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T10:38:35+00:00" title="December 20, 2011 10:38AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>...the other part that was super-hard to understand was the Secret Arts concept.

They're basically identical to how they were originally, but the layout for the Secret Arts chapter is readable now.<br/><br/>Yeah, I was just about to say that.  The Chi Conditions=Aspects penny dropped for me when I was reading Nobilis 3 (since Bonds &amp; Afflictions are also in that same thematic space), and it makes a handy conceptual shorthand, but they do behave a bit differently in practice, most notably because they're not really tied into an economy in the same way as Fate points (yeah, they can affect Chi recovery, but Joss is closer to Fate points).<br/><br/>Still making my way through the Secret Arts, and... I'm probably not the best person to judge whether or not it's significantly easier to grasp, since I spent a LOT of time parsing and looking up FAQs and advice about the WotG version, so it's burned in too deep for me to suppress and look at the new book with fresh eyes.  I will say that a lot of the text is extremely familiar, and the infamous Elemental Progression chart is still in there (apparently they changed up some of the symbolic associations, but I don't care enough to check right now).<br/><br/>On the other hand, I definitely think they made a huge improvement by introducing the general concept early, and by tying it to combat resolution (and making Chi Conditions via damage the most straightforward and least Destiny-intensive means of inflicting them).  Not getting sidetracked by Chinese alchemic principles on top of trying to internalize this brand new abstract rules minigame is definitely less distracting.<br/><br/>It looks like the Secret Arts proper are not any less intricate or fiddly than in WotG (everything I recall is still in there; Discovery rolls, Yin-Yang Technique, Elemental Progression, Tool bonuses, Extraordinary Techniques), but the underpinnings are presented more clearly, and the whole thing is more relevant to the overall system.  If nothing else, they don't use the word "Predictionism" to mean two related but distinct concepts.  <br/><br/>The different Secret Arts are also much more distinct from one another; there was some of this in the old system (Courtier Arts could only inflict certain kinds of Conditions, etc), but now the practical differences between types of Conditions (Passions, Influences, etc) seem clearer, as are the thematic restrictions between them and what that actually means in the fiction (you need a doctor to patch you up from fights, but only a Courtier will be able to lift your spirits and get rid of that all-consuming fear of your nemesis).  The different Arts also have slight mechanical variations (some have a harder time inflicting Major conditions, most only affect one person but the arts of Battle or the Scholar can affect entire battlefields or issue worldwide prophecies, most can be used in combat-time but only some can be used to knock someone out of a fight).  Most of this was there to at least some degree before, but it's been expanded and, I think, clarified.<br/><br/>I think every Wulin player will have at least a basic understanding and use of Chi Conditions, but only the truly dedicated will put in the effort to invest in Secret Arts and use/abuse them to their fullest.  I think that's definitely a step forward from WotG, where only the truly dedicated had even a passing understanding of them.<br/><br/>However, I do have one major problem with the book I haven't seen come up in the RPG.net thread.  Without going too in-depth, when you do damage in combat, you basically stick trouble dice on people (Ripples).  These persist, and stack throughout the fight as you keep getting hurt, and strong hits will inflict Ripples AND force you to roll your Ripple pool-- you take actual Chi Conditions based on the results of these Rippling rolls, and even if you never get hit quite hard enough to force a roll, you automatically roll at the end of a fight (which can result in more than just a physical damage theme; like, you could be filled with regret for the senseless waste of life, or fear of your opponents).<br/><br/>However, Ripple dice are explicitly noted as not being expended when you make a Rippling roll.  And the combat flowchart does not list any phase where Ripples go away, and none of the Secret Arts I've read so far (all but Taoist magic) have techniques to remove Ripple dice.  So unless I'm missing something or the rule is much farther away from the combat chapter than it should be, there is no way as written to ever get rid of these things.<br/><br/>It's probably just an omission.  There's at least one other pretty significant one; elemental Chi pools automatically have a Breath of 1 per round, but that's nowhere in the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352042/#Comment_352042" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T12:22:11+00:00" title="December 20, 2011 12:22PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Who are the authors?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352043/#Comment_352043" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T12:28:39+00:00" title="December 20, 2011 12:28PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2011 12:30PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Who are the authors?</blockquote>\n"Dudes from RPG.net", basically.

After the Secret Arts, the book closes out with a GM-section grab-bag: some general details about life in Shen Zhou (which is actually sort of redundant with the Loresheets on those topics, isn't it?  There's no real reason to keep it all the way in the back), some discussion of themes (which amusingly uses names of some notable martial-arts movies as section headers), a filmography &amp; bibliography, and then some stuff on relationship charts and campaign plotting that seems very similar to material from Weapons of the Gods.  <br/><br/>The minion rules are greatly simplified from WotG; now they don't roll Initiative (always act last), always attack everyone in their zone with one attack, and are routed when they take a certain number of Ripple dice.  There are also rules for Lesser Legends, for individual NPCs that still aren't worth a full statting-out, which I think will save a lot of headache GM-side (especially since there are about a page of them already statted up for quick use).  There are also rules for legendary weapons (which can be reskinned into techniques of transcendent kung fu for unarmed types), which are I believe toned-down from WotG but still pretty interesting, and also sort of Earthdawny in that the weapons basically gain XP from their wielders' legendary deeds (and lose them for ignominious ones!). I love that the one of the example weapons is the Dog-Beating Stick.  <br/><br/>There's also some advice on creating new martial-arts styles, but it's nowhere near as comprehensive as WotG's Million-Style Manual (but they do acknowledge that, and it took a supplement for WotG to go that in-depth anyway).  They go under the hood with the math of how they built the book's External Styles, but are much less helpful regarding Internal Styles, which are frankly much more problematic to design. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, and WotG's Great Game is not present, but again that was supplemental material so expecting it in the corebook wasn't realistic anyway.  Not that I ever finished reading the GG anyway.<br/><br/>So overall, Legends of the Wulin never quite escapes Weapons of the Gods' shadow, but I'm a big Jenna Moran fan and thought WotG was full of really great prose that made me really excited to play and run the game.  However, this is an RPG and not a novel, and I have to acknowledge that Wulin is probably better where it counts.  While it does not make the Loresheets easier to absorb or reference, the book explains its rules much more clearly than its predecessor and I have to give it serious credit for that, even if a couple of fairly crucial things seem to have slipped past editing (like how to lose Ripple dice or regain Elemental Chi).  I'm terrible at judging a system without playing it, but all the rules changes between editions seem to be for the better. I'm looking forward to trying this out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352254/#Comment_352254" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T09:00:38+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  9:00AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>Also, thank you for the review! WOTG was one of my favorite games filled with awesome ideas and rules quirks that was impossible to play because of the sheer amount of work needed to make a character: The Lore Sheet concept is a brilliant way to create deep characters, tied to the setting. But as it, it means you need to read hundreds and hundreds of pages to decide which ones to take/use (as the book had no quick run-down or summary of the sheets, nor were there any "quick play combos" of lore sheet builds for ready-to-go-characters). It was just one of the few things that made the game really really really hard to run if you didn't have time to read hundreds of pages, or were not involved in the development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike_Olson</cite><br/>But the Lore Sheets were definitely another stumbling block. Only players who owned the book had a fightin' chance of reading them -- and we damn sure weren't going to take up valuable gaming time passing our two or three books around so everyone could read every Lore Sheet to see what interested them -- which meant that they pretty much didn't get read. So anything I introduced to them from the setting as-written was both news to them and something it would've been cool for them to interact with mechanically but which they couldn't because they hadn't spent points on it.</blockquote>\nSo yeah, I don't think this has been addressed at all, and it is kind of a problem.  I'm already thinking about the scenario I want to use to test-drive the game, and neither of the ideas I have are set in Shen Zhou at all.  It's a real shame-- the Loresheet concept is a great one (and some of the new ones are pretty great, like the philosophical ones that let you add Buddhist Virtues to your heroic ones so you can gain great fame and Destiny for acts of piety and moral uprightness), but honestly I just don't think it's realistic to expect every player in the group to have read 100-odd pages of setting info backward and forward, and neither do I want to compile my own "good parts" version for a cheat sheet.  But since I have the PDF, maybe just printing out all the actual Loresheets might be good enough, and anyone who's especially interested in anything specific can investigate further on their own time.  Hmm.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike_Olson</cite><br/>It's a frustrating thing I've found with Shen-Zhou and some other cool settings (Sundered Skies and Kerberos Club spring to mind) where, as the GM, I'm like, "This is awesome!" but in play it all ends up being the equivalent of an origin story. The players get introduced to new things, but if you want to be subtle about leveraging those things you have to wait several sessions for it to really mean something to them. And several sessions is not a luxury I can usually afford (or even have available).</blockquote>\nI ran into this problem pretty bad with Over the Edge a while ago. Al Amarja is probably one of my favorite settings, but GMing it for a bunch of newbies made me realize "holy hell, there is absolutely no way I can convey all the awesome bizarre things about this setting in any kind of immediately digestible way".  I think the session ended up going well, but I was still a little disappointed that I couldn't get the full awesome weird texture across.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352327/#Comment_352327" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-23T01:43:20+00:00" title="December 23, 2011  1:43AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe McGuffin</cite>But since I have the PDF, maybe just printing out all the actual Loresheets might be good enough, and anyone who's especially interested in anything specific can investigate further on their own time.

That would be three or four sentences for each sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
