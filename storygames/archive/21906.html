                    New year, same question: what did you play this week? And if you didn't game, don't feel bad. There's always next week.<br/><br/>If you want to chat about someone's game or dig into detail, start a new thread and go wild. More threads talking about games are better.<br/><br/>(Here's what we played in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21409/what-did-you-play-this-week-2018/" rel="nofollow">2018</a>, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/" rel="nofollow">2017</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016/" rel="nofollow">2016</a>)                </div>

                            I played <b>Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne</b> (with Paul T, Jeff and Dave). I found this game quite charming. The subject matter is very serious (burning a witch is, after all, a very deliberate act of murder), and lent itself well to drawing the best out of the players. Dave's haunting rendition of the witch Elouise helped set the tone for the story. I played Ham, the unreliable guide. I had a surprising amount of fun playing the role of an anti-hero coward. It turned out that my "Ham" was really someone else, who had replaced the murdered original, and was leading the procession into a trap. When the trap failed, Ham even managed to avoid discovery, (barely) outsmart his companions and get away. We had an amazing surprise ending as Brother Armond actually <i>replaced</i> an innocent Elouise at the stake.<br/><br/>I also played <b>Muse</b> with my co-workers. We're playing a <i>cosmic horror</i> game in which the Elder Gods have bound Azathoth (the insane, blind watchmaker creator god) to human form on Earth. Meanwhile, the Great Old Ones are plotting to release Azathoth from his binding, and somehow Azathoth's human-seeming grandson Avery is a part of their plans... We're still at the early part of the story, but it's shaping up to be a good one.                        </div>

                            Started to play <b>D&amp;D 5E Lost Mines of Palvander</b>. I'm a half orc paladin and I try to play it princess play wise.<br/><br/>We continued our <b>BitD</b> hack campaign. This 6th session was the best IMHO. I started to slide back to my satyrical 'boorish idiots &amp; ignorant assholes' in NPC style which players always seem to love! I cannot jump<br/><br/>I also playtested my fantasy variant of <b>Amidst Endless Quiet</b> about an old witch who can bring back to life a forgotten hero. It was ok but needs some fresh thoughts. Maybe Ill borrow ideas from Diadem after I tried that out!                        </div>

                            I ran <i>Numenera</i> yesterday, finishing up our first adventure after numerous sessions.  This has turned out to be very much a casual, hanging-out sort of game group. I ran "The Vortex," the first Gen Con adventure. Remarkably, despite all the messing around and side chatter, everyone survived and completed both stages of it (only one of twelve groups made it to the second stage at Gen Con 2013).                        </div>

                            I played a session of my in development game Thornwood: School of Magics with some improviser pals of mine. They came up with some hilarious characters and got through three weeks of school and character creation in our 3 and a bit hour session which is a pretty good pace I think. <br/><br/>This one will hopefully be more of an ongoing thing so I can work out some best-practices for campaign based gming for the game. The game is meant to have on overarching mystery peppered with school drama (Skunko was forced into a duel with someone who was bullying them and nailed a roll to use the spell they were learning that made people blurt out their most embarrassing secret, which was very effective in front of the gathered crowd). One thing I want to do is set up some guidelines for the gm to be able to generate a mystery on the fly, so I'm seeing how that works out by trying it myself. <br/><br/>So far the threat has been introduced: some sylvan spirits have been angered and are violently possessing the Thornwood tree and the animated Broomstick servants. I've just been winging it so far but now between sessions there might be a little bit of prep to set up some red herrings and find out who or what is behind the disturbance.<br/><br/>The session also highlighted a couple of incomplete mechanics so I'll have to work on them.                        </div>

                            Hurray for a new year and new thread! Reading about what people have been playing is my favorite thing about this forum. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This weekend I had the wonderful pleasure of attending the Language Play mini-convention in Olympia. Thorny Games came and ran some of their games as well as some other games that focus on language. <br/><br/>First, I finally got an opportunity to play <b>Dialect</b>. We played the Martian Outpost setting and had a lot of fun creating corporate babble. I want to think about how I can bring the language more to the forefront next time I play. I felt like we created a very cool story, but I also felt we didn't focus enough on our dialect. <br/><br/>I also got to playtest their upcoming game <b>Xenolanguage</b>. I won't say too much because the mechanics are still in development, but it was an excellent game mirroring the premise and structure of the movie Arrival/"Story of Your Life". I'm excited to see this game finished and out in the world!                         </div>

                            I ran a playtest of <b>Facing the Titan</b>, a story-game I'm writing.

A dragon that destroyed cities because it felt their leader was guilty. Of something.<br/><br/>Playtest was great, cause the game ran well, but also because some flaws were revealed.

                            My colleagues and I played a second session of cosmic horror flavoured <b>Muse</b> at work. One of the Questions is, "Will Ozzy find his grandson Avery?" For those not familiar with the mechanics, until the Question is formally answered, no-one is allowed to narrate the answer. This creates a lot of back-and-forth where plot events might make it more or less likely that Ozzy finds Avery without Ozzy actually finding him (or definitively losing him).  This has led to some pretty funny in-game moments, like: (1) Ozzy sensing that his grandson was in danger, teleporting to the scene, not seeing Avery immediately behind Ozzy, and Ozzy blasting the attacker in annoyance and teleporting away again, and (2) Ozzy using magic to track Avery and continuously arriving to Avery's location moments after Avery left. I'm sure Ozzy felt a bit like Fievel in <i>An American Tail</i>.<br/><br/>None of the other players is a gamer, and at the end of last session one of them asked me if it would be "OK if he played the game on his own with his cousins." Yay!                        </div>

                            Last night, I played a session of <i>Fall of Magic</i>. It's my first time with the game, which I picked up recently for a little cheaper than the retail price (one player had played it once before).  We had a great time, and it forms a fitting end to a few lovely months of playing in-person with this all of this group. One of the players is moving to Taiwan, unfortunately for the rest of us. This has been one of my favorite groups to play with ever, and this game was perfect for us and the methods of shared collaboration we've developed. <br/><br/>We had five players, which means each round takes a while, but we ended on Castle Stormguard after about four hours. One player was the fugitive from Stormguard, and that helped create a great climax. (The player moving the Magus left it up to a die roll to see which way we'd go at the first fork in the road, so off to the castle we went.) We're going to try to get another couple of hours in next week, though there's no way we'll get to explore the entirety of the map. We might try finishing it up over Roll20, but that means missing out on the lovely physical components.<br/><br/>The other gaming for the week was on Roll20, discussing an upcoming game of <i>Day After Ragnarok</i> (<i>Savage Worlds</i> version).                         </div>

We use the Cthuloid assumptions for our play, with a final score of "one tragic hero, two evil villains" by the time we got to out last memories.<br/><br/>In the afternoon, I ran <b>My Life with Master</b> in a shortened form for four players, telling the tale of a dismebodied being trying to construct the perfect vessel for itself by collecting parts from the local townsolk. At the end of the game, two minions integrated back into society, one destroyed themselves by completing the hanging they had been sentenced to many years ago and the last was destroyed by the townsfolk as they were determined to burn a witch and she was the best target that presented itself.                        </div>

Yes, one of the players got the epilogue that resulted in them being killed instead of joining the townsfolk, leaving the town, becoming the new Master, etc. We'd set up an angry mob of townsfolk setting off to destroy the 'evil witch of the woods' who was threatening to take their children, but the Minions had already destroyed the Master by the time the townsfolk arrived. The player of a crone-like character, who had the bad habit of cackling uncontrollably when witnessing murder, narrated how the angry mob picked on her as a way to vent their hostility and she was burned as a witch.                        </div>

                            Very interesting! We are playing MlwM for the first time ever over here, so it's cool to see how the epilogue rules can interact with the developing fiction. Cheers!                        </div>

                            Contingency Games, Day 2:<br/>A playtest of <b>Best Quest</b> (still a placeholder name) this morning: the system uses character sheets for archetypal fantasy hero roles, which have prompts for heroic deeds tailored to that character, e.g. the Barbarian fights huge monsters, the Bard tells tales of glory, etc. The other players then put forward their suggestions for the details of the deed and everyone votes on which one they like best. You score XP based on how many people vote for the same deed and whoever has most XP at the game's end gets to level their character up!<br/><br/>I ran <b>There's Somebody at the Door</b> this afternoon, my tense and paranoid PvPish game using the Hot War system, with the premise that the only 5 humans exploring an alien planet are interrupted at their meal time by an impossible visitor. I love this scenario because it frequently reaches a point where I can sit back and let the PCs s react &amp; scheme for about 30 minutes at a time.<br/><br/>Finally, this evening I found a space in a game of <b>Savage Worlds: Rippers</b>, taking on the role of a Scottish Reverend and playing my part in ridding a town of a curse, a headless horsemen, zombies and an evil sorceress.                        </div>

                            Last night we played the first session of a science fiction hack of <i><b>Swords Without Master</b></i> (<i>Stars Without Master</i>? <i>Space Without Master</i>?) and it was great so far. We have an interesting setting where half the sapient species ascended into a Singularity state, turned into energy beings and apparently left the galaxy. And the survivors left behind don't understand all the tech from the before. So the PCs are going to be scavenging pre-Rapture tech and try to get it to work to resell it.<br/><br/>And the PCs are great. A starship engineer, raised in a hyperdrive cult but now exiled for heresy. A cyborg sent into the universe as a living probe, never able to return home. A genetically engineered perfect human with a cyborg dog and a knack for finding things. An amoral archaeologist seeking ancient technology. And a mysterious stranger who can sing forgotten dirges to put people to sleep.                        </div>

                            Started off the week running <b>D&amp;D 5e</b> in a conference room at the office, at the request of some workmates. The group was made up of two first-timers and one of my longtime gaming co-conspirators. The first adventure is a super-simple little dungeon crawl - enter abandoned manor / retrieve macguffin / flee - but with hooks enough for me to parlay it into a bigger thing given sufficient player interest. The experienced player in the group played a bard, which was great because it allowed him to help out the party/move stuff forward with utility spells, while not taking up too much spotlight during combat (and thus allowing room for the new folks to take action in response to combat's clearer cues). The new players were great participants and seemed to have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The one big house-rule I used was to drop traditional initiative and instead run initiative in more of a dungeon-world way, as someone on here suggested <i>(sorry, can't recall who...2097?)</i>.  While that's worked great for groups of more experienced D&amp;D heads, it seemed to create "when is it my turn?" questions for the new folks. So, probably back to boring old regular initiative next time.<br/><br/>And I get to run Torchbearer for the first time on Sunday! Very excited!<br/><br/> </div>

                            On Monday, I played <b>My Life With Master</b> with some of the folks on this board. The sneaky GM created a scene where my minion (whose monstrous trait is that he is extremely aggressive) was forced to nearly murder a small child. One of the other PCs stepped in and gouged out my minion's eye! Ouch! Great scene, though. The third minion ended up in a struggle to steal a tiny amount of gold from a town person (due to a request from the Master), only to have the Master furious at him that he brought back so little gold. It was a really great session!<br/><br/>On Wednesday, I played <b>Muse</b> with my coworkers. Last session, one of the players couldn't make it and we played without him. When he read through the synopsis of what happened, he kept saying, "What?!? Who came up with this one?!" and every time it was me sheepishly raising his hand. In our plot, one of the main characters (Avery) is the grandson of Azathoth (the blind idiot creator god), which puts him in potentially the same power bracket as Cthulhu. We hadn't specified up-front what Avery's powers would be. I was inspired by an old anime whose name I forget to have Avery get frequently, gruesomely killed, only to get up moments later completely unharmed. Of course, after having criticized me, the newly-returned-player went ahead and narrated more gruesome Avery death scenes during Wednesday's session. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>

<b>Space Without Master</b>: Two players couldn't make it this week, so I decided that their characters had fallen ill with a mysterious space sickness. I didn't know what it was when I declared this, though, so we had a Discovery phase where we learned more about the illness (a nanite plague caught from some pre-Singularity batteries the PCs were salvaging) and what they were going to do about it. In the end, they went to a space station and learned the nanite plague was a self-replicating terraforming engine that could wipe out life on a planet and replace it with something else. The space station's inhabitants wanted this super-weaponto crush their enemies, but the PCs realized they weren't to be trusted with that sort of power. <br/><br/>So there was a cool action/chase sequence where they were pushing hospital gurneys through a space station as laser fire rained down around them and the cyborg drained the air from the spaceship to take out the guards onboard, giving them the opportunity to flee with the nanite superweapon in hand.  What will they do with this new weapon in hand now? I don't know, but I look forward to next week when we'll find out.<br/><br/><br/>I need a good list of science fiction-y names and NPC quirks to use when making up NPCs and locations on the fly, because my world-building has been less than stellar. (Note to self: reuse leftover inspirational images I provided at the start of the game.)                        </div>

                            Makes sense to me. The designer has lots of great tips on how to play it effectively on his website - www.bastionland.com<br/><br/>I would imagine it's just the usual "story game" vs. OSR clash: there's not a whole lot of overlap between those two styles of play, either in method, techniques, or material.<br/><br/>Still, I'd love to hear more about that, too!                        </div>

                            After trying for a long time to get a group together to focus on story games, I gave up and got a D&amp;D 5e group instead. There’s a plethora of players out there wanting DMs, so after just a bit of screening I got 5 players who were willing to put up with my savage house ruling of 5e :-) I changed alignment, XP, initiative, and inspiration, among other things. <br/><br/>Two of the players are new to role-playing, and seem to be enjoying it so far, but it’s been so long since I’ve been a beginner that I worry if I’m treating them as best I can. I do try to make sure they’re not overwhelmed with rules technicalities. The newest player is still a bit shy about participating - for example she mostly stayed out of the recent dragon encounter. If anyone has any tips about making new players comfortable, I’m all ears!                        </div>

                            That sounds like a topic well worth a new thread! I bet people would have all kinds of good suggestions, and would be curious about your house rules, too.<br/><br/>Most of my thoughts fall under the umbrella of "don't play D&amp;D5", unfortunately. (The game is far too complex for beginners, in my opinion, and receives an overrated reputation as a "simple" game just because it's lighter in form than 3rd or 4th.)                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/moconnor">@moconnor</a> <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <br/>I liked the rules, especially using dilemmas.<br/><br/>However one of my players said that he felt detached from his PC all along. I think character generation was too random and 'unfair' for his story gamey style. He especially hated that he had only 1 HP. In actual play he played his PC brilliantly but not really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Several other ItO GM had similar experiences!<br/><br/>One easy solution could be to not play ItO with these people.<br/><br/>Another one is to add some kind of procedures which does not change the rules but add more backstory, depth or personality to the character. I was suggested to take a look at MazeRats and I will...<br/><br/>But in the end I think its okay to say that heavily randomized murderhoboing (even if it can be played in a very educated, highbrow style) is not for everyone!<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">@hamnacb</a> - Ben Robbins is quite right. Meanwhile, just a short note:<br/><br/>Playing in this style (often referred to as "OSR") is very different from story game play. Embracing unusual and strange characters as a play challenge and then being prepared to see them die early on is a big part of the "aesthetic" and the fun in a game like that.<br/><br/>There are two approaches I've seen which work well: either (1) to embrace the random and hilarious joy of characters dying with appalling regularity (see below), or (2) to take a hardcore stance where a tough starting situation like a character with no useful skills and 1 hit point makes you grin with glee: now there is a REAL challenge for your skills!<br/><br/>The best illustration of this playstyle I've seen is here (it's very amusing to read!):<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18249/the-osr-in-vivid-colour-an-actual-play" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18249/the-osr-in-vivid-colour-an-actual-play</a><br/><br/>Adding more backstory, depth, or personality to the characters will make the problem *worse*, not better, as it will make character death sting even more.<br/><br/>The general conceit in this style of play is that characters don't have backstories and detailed personas... they have to earn those in play! You get to "create" the character through play, in other words, instead of doing so *before* play even begins.<br/><br/>Having said that, low starting hit points are one of the most commonly house ruled elements in OSR games (as you can see in the link, above). My favourite solution is to use "quantum hit points": instead of rolling your hit dice at character creation, you roll them when you get injured for the first time. This preserves all the features of the game's design (doesn't change any of the rules, really!) but doesn't leave anyone feeling dejected because they're going into a game with 1 hit point. That's what I do when I play OSR-style D&amp;D!<br/><br/>Having said <i>that</i>, however, <i>Into the Odd</i> is far more forgiving than most OSR games (and Maze Rats is far more lethal!), because your hit points are much less important than the damage you take to your stats. Starting with 1 HP isn't really all that bad in <i>Into the Odd</i>; it's a fairly reasonable proposition, in fact.                        </div>

                            Ran the end of part 3 of Our Ladies of Sorrows, and we're unsure whether or not it makes sense to run the coda. As things just ended, I'm in that weird GM head space where I have no idea if I did this right or mucked it up, which means it's probably a good time to dig out the DVD for Labyrinth, which I need to rewatch before Intercon S anyway.                        </div>

                            In the last two weeks, I played in each of my campaigns once each:<br/><br/><b>My Life With Master:</b> another great session. Darren (the alchemical golem) finished the evil deed the Master had tasked him with (evicting the natives living on the edge of town), telling himself the whole time that if he didn't do it someone else would do even worse to them! Ha! That's the Mantra of Evil if ever I heard it. Meanwhile, the Master seemed to be off sightseeing somewhere, which gave our characters all the time in the world to pump our contacts for all the Love we could muster. This cost my character Bush all the money he had, and with looming debts still on the horizon, he'll probably have to go back to the Master soon for his pay cheque... <br/><br/><b>Muse:</b> Avery's adventures continued. He ended up meeting Gaea, who had awoken from her long slumber to prevent Azathoth (bound to human form as Ozzie, as you may recall) from finding Avery. All these encounters with the supernatural started awakening Avery's cosmic powers, and he found the whole thing rather overwhelming. He worked on securing his dream job at GOOgle (the headquarters of the Great Old Ones), and they hired him and then immediately tried to sacrifice him in a ritual to break Azathoth's binding. The ritual failed when Avery didn't die after multiple stabbings. Avery went back home to start his sweet telecommuting job and found himself a first date! The mundane part of his life was really going well! Now all he has to do is sort out the whole the-world-is-ending-and-everyone-wants-to-use-him thing...                        </div>

                            I ran a 5e one shot on Friday night because there were some people at my office who wanted to try it. I have issues with 5e but I'm always excited to run a game for new players and that's what they wanted to play. It's often pretty hard to guess what people want from 5e because D&amp;D means different things to different people.<br/><br/>I ended up describing them in a tavern and some of the rumors they had heard while they were there. I also described what kind of adventure they could expect for each rumor. They ended up following up on the mysterious fanged cavern opening some shepherds had discovered, which I told them would lead to sort of classic D&amp;D dungeon with deadly traps, secret doors, and treasure.<br/><br/>I was running <i>Tomb of the Serpent Kings</i> which describes itself as a teaching dungeon. I don't know how much to attribute to the players being very smart people and how to much attribute it to design of the dungeon, but they picked things up very quickly. They seemed like they had a great time too, I was really pleased.                        </div>

                            I ran my weekly <b>Monsterhearts: Mount Pleasant Community College</b> game, although only two players were able to make it this week. Luckily, they were characters with a hell of a lot of baggage to work through. <br/><br/>The Wyrm and the Serpentine in this game are a lot alike in many ways. They're both the golden children of their respective families, laden with a ton of expectations. Both of them are violently protective of their friends. Both of them have supportive (if somewhat suffocating) families with piles and piles of bloody skeletons in their closet. Both of them are the last hopes of their respective species (Dragons and Snake People), as the time of the Serpent has long since past and the time of Dragons is waning. <br/><br/>All of last season though, fate found them thrown against each other. Their families have warred for centuries, and the suburbs of mount pleasant were built on the theft of the Serpent People's ancient holdings, and the murder of their allies. Meanwhile, Mount Pleasant was built to be a lasting legacy for the Dragons: a perfect community that could serve as a model for humans to improve their kind. A sort of societal hoard whose pristine order clashes violently with the monstrous and archaic impulses of the Salazar clan. <br/><br/>They've thrown barbs at each other, schemed against one another, and on one fucked up occasion that involved memory alteration and brainwashing slept together (although the Serpentine and the Wyrm both later decided that they were okay with that last bit, even in the face of the mind-magic). That changed in this session, as they came together to fight a common foe and bonded together as friends. But they're worlds apart, and the enemies they share are family. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see if this messy, unstable friendship can endure. <br/> </div>

                            I played in a session of OSR B/X D&amp;D; scions of an ancient family returning to reclaim some of their heritage in an abandoned magical city.<br/><br/>There was lots of hilarious roleplaying and eventually we found our way into a factory... which has been turned into a hellish prison by some bizarre gargoyle-like creatures.<br/><br/>We were caught and two characters died (but survived for the moment due tonight the use of a Death &amp; Dismemberment table), while the rest of us were getting overwhelmed, looking like a likely TPK.<br/><br/>We agreed to surrender, while two of the characters struggled to swallow keys we had stolen earlier - when we play again, it will be as prisoners of the hellish jail. But once those keys, uh, emerge again... freedom! So we hope, anyway.                        </div>

                            I'm writing a small RPG which blends a 90's modern era gnostic horror setting with OSR mechanics. I call the game Kuf, a Swedish word meaning something along the lines of weirdo or outsider.<br/><br/>A friend has become smitten with the idea and has written a scenario/dungeon for it. Yesterday we played. I was a player and my friend ran the game as written out of the latest draft. Together with four other PCs we explored an other worldly structure and saw monsters before escaping back home again. <br/><br/>Good times!                         </div>

                            Since last time...<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts: Kingsport 1886</b> wherein the King of Faery tried to recontact his former favorite, Emily Dickinson, before she died. This was a lovely campaign that also featured a cameo from Noah Whateley of the Dunwich Whateleys.<br/><br/><b>Sagas of the Icelanders</b>: I'm giving this another go after a disappointing long run about four years ago; I've got a lot more PbtA MCing under my belt and so far it looks somewhat promising. We have an unmarried woman, a scheming Gothi, a Monster, and a Wanderer, so looks decent so far.<br/><br/><b>Good Society: Belligerence &amp; Benevolence</b> aka "Let's try to do Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace</i> using Good Society." I Luuuuuurve this game so much right now; the cast is pitch-perfect, with standout work across multiple characters. We had a duel that was set up and described only in the epistolary phase, wonderful letters between my elderly general and his long time mistress, revelations every 20 minutes, and a cameo from Napoleon during the Battle of Austerlitz.<br/><br/><b>Our Ladies of Sorrow</b>: Lisa can rest easy; I liked it. Poor Joyce stalked off into the rain, having seen her friends become that which they fought against.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> I wish I could play in your Tolstoy game! And hope you keep writing about it.<br/><br/>Our first game of the year has been Spirit of 77.  We just had our last session on Sunday. Overall this was a really fun campaign. Too long of a story to share it all, but the finale had several PCs drop acid in a barn/secret Buddhist temple and travel to the astral plane to fight the ghost of a cult leader. After the tragic death of my character's sensei in the previous session, I was happy that I survived to retire and carry on his legacy by opening Sensei Buck's Karate Garage, a combination motorcycle repair shop/dojo in the heart of Venus City.                        </div>

                            Wow! That is an amazing titles sequence. Thanks for sharing!<br/><br/>There has been some really fascinating new research/scholarship on the War of 1812 in the last ten years or so; nice to see, since, until now, most sources on both sides (French and Russian) were extremely biased, for political reasons. <br/><br/>I've got to check this out sometime! Hard to find time for watching AP, but this one is very tempting.                         </div>

                            So, I did actually manage to run Torchbearer a few Sundays ago - finally have time to post about it. I have some thoughts...and some <i>feels.</i><br/><br/>First thought: Dang! Those Wheel Burners know how to build some tight mechanical loops! And whereas gaining skill/mastery in Burning Wheel takes time (by virtue of fiddly-ness and opacity of some of the mechanisms), the feedback that the system provided to the players had them learning and adjusting their play style pretty quickly. This meant I was really able to just focus on evocatively running and describing the 'dungeon' (a cursed manor in this case) - I didn't have to make sure I was telegraphing a sense of danger or uncertainty to the players, as the mechanics were generating that in spades.<br/><br/>Second thought: I understand "Twists" now! The way that Twists were explained in Mouse Guard just didn't penetrate my brain for whatever reason. But reading (and even more so, running) Torchbearer it clicked for me that <b>Twists are just Hard Moves a la PBtA.</b> That is, a Twist is a consequence/outcome/bit of narration from the GM that is so punishing that you need a failed die roll to justify it. Not sure if this makes me want to run Mouse Guard now (still not super into how mission-structured it is), but it was a satisfying thing to figure out.<br/><br/>Third FEEL: I don't think I like being a punishing, strict referee to players. Like, running TB is fun and satisfyingly game-y, and I like that the system allows you to "play hard" by giving the players plenty of tools and gauges. It felt fair. But I'm not sure "fair" is what I'm looking for - I much prefer "generally collaborative, if gently adversarial" as a GM stance. I found myself feeling a little guilty after the session ended. Will definitely play a few more sessions to wrap up the cursed manor adventure, but probably won't stick with TB for anything longer term.                        </div>

For some reason—maybe it's the tough reputation the game has garnered— GMs new to TB think they're supposed to be mean. Don't. The system is mean for you! Meaner (not harder) than any other fantasy RPG I know of. You need to be merciful.<br/><br/>"Be a fan of the player characters" is still very much in play here. In fact, it's more important than ever. The mechanics in TB do a great job of being mean about survival. The GM's job is really to put a light at the end of the tunnel and help the players reach it <i>despite</i> the rules. When they get a taste of that hard-won success, that's what hooks them.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Yeah, I dig that Mordeth. I just kept feeling like I wanted to 'pull my punches' when dealing out twists and consequences...like I was really reluctant to 'allow' the system to be as mean as it is. I felt personally culpable, and it wasn't really my jam. <br/><br/>That being said, I like the concept of "The GM's job is really to put a light at the end of the tunnel...", and am wondering if leaning into that role next time I run TB might increase my enjoyment / decrease my guilt. I'm definitely already being a fan of the PCs (IMO that's the only way to GM, except in very specific games/circumstances), but the idea of actively trying to convey to players "your actions are driving progress to your goal!" seems a little different - and is something I'm v. interested in trying to do. Thanks lots for the suggestion and encouragement!                        </div>

                            After constantly talking about TRPGs, some of my friends asked me to show them the hobby. Now it’s them constantly bugging me about playing again.<br/><br/>We played 3 Sessions of Dungeon World, doing all the fun fanatsy cliches from meeting in a tavern to evil wizard tower and sky castle.<br/>The party are a Bard, Thief and Barbarian on a quest to save the realm from an evil wizard.<br/>What suprised me how quickly the players got a hang of it. Especially the Bard, who uses her specials moves to create flavor and lore for everything. In the second session she even started a map without any prompting on my part.<br/>Playing with people new to the hobby is one of my favorite things, especially when you can see the moment were they „get it“ .<br/><br/>Another observation I made while playing is that this is the first time Dungeon World seems to be working for me. I always felt it quickly fell apart when you tried to do anything that wasn’t strictly fantasy and DnD tropes. But for playing a sort of theme park game, doing all the fun cliches, seems a perfect fit. <br/> </div>

                            I love me some DW and it is great for new players. But yes, there is a lot of implied setting in the character playbooks and I think it would be tough to change the genre tropes without some hacking. YMMV!                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">@Mel_White</a> , I'd also love to hear how The Bat Hack went.  I didn't play it because I read "you don't need to know anything about baseball to play it" and I am a <i>hardcore</i> baseball fan, so I figured I wouldn't be on the same page with the group.  But if hardcore baseball fans can <i>also</i> dig it, I'd be very interested in playing sometime.                        </div>

                            Hi all,<br/><br/>My work colleagues and I continued our <b>Muse</b> campaign this week. The Great Old Ones were pulling out all the stops in their attempts to kill Avery and release Azathoth from his binding. This included mind-controlling Avery's date so she ripped out his heart (<i>literally</i>) and murdering almost the whole pantheon of Elder Gods while they plotted around their war table. This latter event opened Pandora's Box, and things were getting pretty heated on planet Earth (in the boiling oceans sense). Yikes! The other players are expecting me to win the Climax Question (the final contest of the game) and narrate an unhappy ending for everyone. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/>  Just because I did that last time...<br/><br/>I also played our Yukon Gold Rush-flavoured <b>My Life With Master</b> campaign with friends on this forum. My character Bush (a former lawman) got orders from the Master to capture a native man and his cyborg son (the boy Bush had injured got turned into an alchemical cyborg to save his life). We had a cool gun battle between Bush and the father. This put Bush in direct conflict with another PC yet again, this time Galilee the tortured young boy that can smell honest gold. Galilee actually held Bush at gunpoint (!!) while the family got away. Then Bush turned the tables, handcuffed Galilee to a post and took off after the family...<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to more!<br/><br/>--Jonathan                        </div>

                            Dreamation!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> sorry I never actually got to talk to you there.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>  Sounds like you were a busy man!  So glad you were able to make it; I know that had been in doubt.<br/><br/>Here's what I played:<br/><br/><b>Masks</b> wide-con.  I remain very impressed with the quality of the Masks playbooks.  This was the second time I've played, only this time with 16 other players, and all the playbook options were still stellar.  <a href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">@Brendan_Conway</a> has done an amazing job of breaking "teen superhero" into so many fun and different flavors.  As for the wide-con, it was neat to get in a little game time with so many different people, and the sense of so many characters active in a shared world was neat... but rather than being a 16-hr plot broken into 4 simultaneous chunks (which sounds awesome in my head), it was more like a 1-hr plot with lots of filler for the characters to separately tackle before reconvening for the next plot point.  What we did in the first 3 rounds was fun, but it didn't strike me as terribly consequential.  The next plot point was gonna be the thing the organizers prepped, regardless.  I missed the 4th round, though, do to catching a train which proceeded to strand me in the middle of nowhere.  Now I know why NJ Transit gets such a bad rap.<br/><br/><b>Thousand Arrows</b>.  I dig <i>so many things</i> about this game -- glad I backed it on Kickstarter!  The color, the 4 elements as stats, the variety of playbooks, the default minions and the moves you use to deploy them, the territory covered by the basic moves, etc.  I envision this game as something I'd want to use for PvP with a good amount of politicking, and I was initially a little underwhelmed by the session premise of "escort heir to throne while ninjas attack you".  But that's not how things played out at all!  Everyone at the table just dug into the characters and situations hard, and in the end some serious arcs were explored and completed.  The character Drives and the relationship questions we answered created a nice blend of reasons to work both together and at cross purposes, and although there was no PvP combat, we definitely struggled with each other plenty over goals and plans and loyalties.  In the end, the irresponsible heir forged a connection with her estranged family through the honesty and dedication their retainer showed her in the process of exorcising the ghost of her brother who was haunting a pirate ship.  And the retainer repaid her debt to the family, a debt incurred by participating in the robbery that got the brother killed in the first place.  And the pirate got his ship un-cursed, which (as revealed at the end) turned out to be the reason he'd accepted the "transport the heir" mission in the first place.  Just a killer session.  Big shout out to Brennan Taylor, Nicolas Hornyak and Jason Hill. <img alt=":grin:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/grin.png" title=":grin:"/> <br/><br/><b>Ten Candles</b>.  The Rapture arrived in blackness aboard a cruise ship.  Only the innocent children were worth saving in the eyes of the otherworldly "divine"... and only once all the adults had been shown the light and then sacrificed.  That's what we did with it, anyway.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  The system was fantastic for building atmosphere and prompting us to add details and developments and false hopes.  Blowing out candles probably takes the cake as my favorite countdown mechanic.                        </div>

                            This weekend, I attended (and co-organized) a local french convention : Le Colloque de Bob. Three sessions for three different games.<br/><br/><b>Facing the Titan :</b> I ran a demo of my GM-Less game, where we face Lofituina, the Horror of the Deep. 5 players (counting myself), and this demo proves me that 6 players is too much and that I need to limit (in the presentation) the game to 5. I also need to have a "cooperative" roll for players to act together on a scene. Great demo, the "mini-universe" runs well and some modifications following the last demo have been applied with success !<br/><br/><b>Ghosts without Master :</b> My "dark-fantasy" "Castlevania / Dark Souls / Ravenloft / ..." hack of Swords Without Master runs well. But it was not suited for this session which is special during this con : Random Players to Random Table. The group I got was very beginner, or not used to narrative games. The start of the session was hard, the players had difficulties to see what they could do. But it went well in the end. Not great. Just well. The characters were "Nonamed" trying to bring down a "Dark Lord". The session started with the Lord in a coffin, trapped, and the characters travelling to see the Judge, an antique being who could kill the Lord. So people said. The journey featured a bridge hard to cross, fire skeletons, a strange marsh, a time loop, and the Lord awakening and trying to kill the Judge, who was trying to kill the characters for bringing the Lord. The last scene was great : one of the characters was in fact working for another Lord ...<br/><br/><b>Fiasco :</b> "Tales from Suburbia" is one of my favorite playset. It always makes great games. This one was one of them. Kentucky. A preacher, his wife who likes dogs very much, the widow who helps at the parish, a grumpy security man (working for the lady) and the car-repair man, link by some blood with the preacher. Also an old lady with a lot of money, a video of dog love, many old secrets, and an ending in blood. One dead, one fugitive with a memory loss, an assassin in prison, and two people losting their marbles.<br/><br/>A great con, with fresh new faces, old ones, and a very good finish.                        </div>

                            I played a...very hefty amount of games recently. Had a couple of planned games not been cancelled I think I would have averaged one game a day for about two weeks <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> <br/><br/><b>Good Society: Belligerence &amp; Benevolence</b>: This game produced some of my favorite RPing in a long while. We ended up drifting a bit into a story of queer lovers trapped in a social situation that could not accept them, basically discovering what <i>War &amp; Peace</i> would have looked like if it was written by Evelyn Waugh. The last session ended with a devastating 90 minutes of recriminations as five people tried to reconcile how much they loved each other and how much they hated what they had done to each other. And then there were heartwarming epilogues! I loved this game.<br/><br/><b>Sagas of the Icelanders</b>: This is going much better this time around. The Monster, a Saxon, is going around murdering his former owner's family, pulling everyone into a whirlpool of blood feuds; our especially scheming Gothi is stirring the pot too.<br/><br/><b>The Bat Hack</b>: We're the members of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League! I liked my character, Julie "Dutchy" Gatz, a tough no-nonsense catcher with a husband living a thousand miles away, a former major-leaguer as a father-in-law, and a pitcher who is mad at her for wanting to start someone who'd actually knock down the opposition when they crowd the plate.<br/><br/>Then <b>Dreamation 2019!</b><br/><br/><b>Jane</b>: This is a game about the network of women who provided abortion services in Chicago before Roe. I had fun with my character, a pre-law student from a traditionally radical Jewish family (the kind that dropped references to the Rosenbergs casually). The session didn't quite gel (we were testing some rules) but I'm interested in seeing where this ends up.<br/><br/><b>Orun</b>: Misha Bushyeager ran her own Afro-Futurist posthuman Space Opera. I played an insectoid physician who seemed fascinated that the deadly poison that was involved in our locked-room mystery turned out to be a great hot sauce base for his species.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts 2: Kingsport 1969</b>: I ran this as a two-parter. The Faery King and Queen were dueling for the Fae's loyalty; our mortal was even more co-dependent than normal; our Infernal was great at walking the tightrope; and the vampire was a hippie. It ended on the road to Woodstock. I had a lot of fun with this one <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>Prime Time Adventures</b>: Our show was set on a sleeper starship heading for planetfall. I played the AI user interface, who was trying to conceal the fact that she could no longer enter sleep mode, leaving her with the choice of either staying awake constantly or going into a catatonic state of unpredictable length. We had some nice work around the table, including some interplay between me and our android doctor, looking at different forms of artificial intelligence.<br/><br/><b>The Mountain Witch</b> with our own <a href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">@Mel_White</a>! I played the samurai-trained daughter of a daimyo, here to see if the Witch would be the agent of vengeance against those who killed my father. I think we all kind of got what we wanted, just not what we needed; the end was downbeat but appropriate.<br/><br/><b>Red Carnations on a Black Grave</b>: I think this was the first time I've actually played my own damn game in a while. We had a nice table, with plenty of rallying speeches, and some heartbreaking moments when the Army arrived in Paris to crush the Commune. Poor Camille <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/><b>Good Society</b> with Rachel E.S. Walton. I played the Meddler, who had a first act conversion experience and tried to use her considerable gifts to get her best friend married to the right person and rehabilitate the reputation of her former best friend. I adore this game.                        </div>

                            I got to GM again after a hiatus of three months. This time the players had requested to play vampires. As in Vampire The Masquerade, “for that sweet gothic 90s vibe”. Spoiler: The gothic nineties vibe never showed up.<br/><br/>I knew that there was a new edition of Vampire available but I’d just cobbled together a simple generic rule system, originally for a wildly different setting, that I wanted to try. So the players would be my guinea pigs. Admittedly it is geared towards my playgroup’s playstyle which leans more towards leaner rules and more storytelling but still with a GM and dice, “We want both role- and playing” as one player is fond of saying. So there weren’t any strong objections when I presented the Bloodsuckers RPG.<br/><br/>Beforehand we had agreed to set it in the modern day city where most of us live. I made a set of archetypes for the different clans and detailed the five people leading the vampire council (no prince here) as well as the vampire handler helping the newly fanged characters enter into the world of darkness. Session one was to be making characters and discussing how the setting worked and maybe some warming up scenes to get the ball rolling.<br/><br/>This session highlighted what I love about RPGs, you can never really predict the outcome when a bunch of people share the same creative mind space. Seen from what the players have played before I could never have guessed at the characters we ended up with: A violent Brujah greasemonkey with a selfish streak, a drug dealing street thug Giovanni, a corrupt policeman Giovanni (these Giovanni do not keep it in the family as it were) and a trailer trash Ventrue with a literal noble boyfriend providing blood and an unkown sire. <br/><br/>I wanted to sort of try out the mystery rules from Nerves of steel so we landed in the starting question of who’d embraced the Ventrue.<br/><br/>The whole thing started with the newly turned vampires at graduation night at Vampire for Beginners (very reminiscient of Swedish for Immigrants, the state run school that teaches the basics of swedish language that continuously gets a bad rep for being mistargeted, unpedagogic, and just generally ill-equipped to do what it sets out to do). Thus unprepared they were sent to the council for a scare talk about keeping on the right side of appropriate and then things went out of hand, in a good way, when the Ventrue in a faux-pas asked them for clarification of who’d made her.<br/><br/>We had a blast! Instead of gothic nineties we got weird gritty social commentary drama marries explosive underground violence against the backdrop of very familiar localities. Also, the rules worked very much as intended, but that might just be because I wrote them and ran them. Can’t wait to play again though.<br/> </div>

I plan to make it "available" before summer, but it's mainly SWM with a change in Tones (Calm / Sinister), a prompt of a dark universe, where the characters have no name (cause the Dark Lords use your name to get to you), and where magic is rare, and only available through the ghosts of the time where magic was still present (my RadX add for another hack, renamed Thanatomancy here).                        </div>

                            Played Brickquest (a medieval fantasy LEGO skirmish-rpg) with three of my ESL students--my niece and her two friends--all 10-years-old girls. They had been bugging me to play for a couple of weeks (they love LEGO). I often use LEGO and LEGO topic for teaching slightly older students.  <br/><br/>They were a fairy, a good witch, and a magical cat (I homebrewed up the three new classes to suit their interests).  I had already built a five room dungeon (an abandoned knights manor) out of LEGO. They were there to rescue a princess (I know it is corny but they are all about princesses). <br/><br/>In the first room they faced a death knight. Instead of fighting him, they decided the fairy would turn him into a frog. Then she squashed him with his own halbred. A spiderweb in the corner was a monster generator spitting out spiders turn after turn. They ran from the spiders but the witch was surrounded by them. The fairy ran away through a curtain into another room smack into three zombies. She turned herself invisible then ran back. The cat and the fairy eventually decided to help the witch (after some prompting by me) after they got over their fear of (LEGO) spiders. Eventually the witch, after reading her character sheet more carefully, realized that she could talk to animals and told the spiders to run away. Then the magical cat broke the spider web, finally. Session over.<br/><br/>It was great fun for them, but the Brickquest combat sub-system is too much of a grind (for me) for a game designed to be played with LEGO with children and parents, etc. or perhaps it is really for AFOL, I don't know, but I need to re-design the combat system so it quick and easy. It needs to be more fluid or it kills the play and roleplaying.<br/><br/>They did great considering it was their first time roleplaying and they were doing it in their second language.                        </div>

                            Had a playtest of my partner Marc's work in progress, <b>Unfinished Business.</b> It's a biographical game where you explore the life of someone who died before accomplishing something they wanted to. <br/><br/>Our departed was a woman in the early 500's AD in the English countryside. Driven by fear, she wanted to leave her "werewolf" husband, but alas, she never did before her untimely death. <br/><br/>One thing I like about the game as it is now are the various things you can do on your turn. It's somewhat like Microscope and the Quiet Year where you can either do something more involved (scenes in this case) or do something a little shorter (snapshots of the person's life or remembrances from those who survived the main character).                         </div>

                            I played the last session of our <b>Muse</b> campaign. It was epic!

Here is the whole <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21979/muse-actual-play-azathoth-returns#latest" rel="nofollow">Actual Play</a>.<br/><br/>We also had a great session of Yukon Gold-Rush flavoured <b>My Life With Master</b>. After having mangled a child and beaten his father, my character Bush (the ex-lawman) finally found some of his humanity and let the family go. Unfortunately, he lost whatever he gained when the Boss (Master) forced him to murder a civilian right in front of Bush's love interest Clementine. :-O  To make matters worse, the civilian in question was one of the other PC's connections, and losing him will prevent the PC from resisting the Master's next order...                        </div>

                            I finaly had a chance to run second playtest of my storytelling game, <b>Ring Tales</b>. I always wanted to make a highly portable game and the 9-card nanogame contest in Board Game Geek sparked an idea that was sleeping deeply in my early sketches. So I made some preparation, talked over two of my friends and we managed to meet for the second time to play descendants of people that live on an artifical ring, a cosmic station floating near distant planet, abandoned by its creators.<br/><br/>There are no dice, only 9 cards to serve every mechanic in the game. The main resolution mechanic itself rensembles Dixit, the Game Master role rotates, and there is also easy set of rules to play with semi artifical Dummy player - a robot companion called R0-BB-13. Yeah, Robbie.                        </div>

                            At Emerald City Comic Con this weekend I ran two games with Indie Games on Demand. In the morning I had an excellent game of <b>Downfall</b>. Our flaw was Civility and we weren't allowed to talk about anything that bothered us! It was a fun problematic theme to explore; no one could leave relationships, you were expected to always keep the peace... it was trouble.<br/><br/>My second game was <b>Companions' Tale</b>, which I hadn't played before. It's really great and I recommend it, especially if you're looking for something with clear rules that's easy to facilitate. If you like The Quiet Year, I really encourage you to try Companions' Tale. It's going to be my go-to map game from now on.                         </div>

                            I've managed to pull another playtest of <b>Facing the Titan</b>, and it's going very well. Still has two things to test out, but the last modifications went very well and made the game better.<br/><br/>This time, it was time to face Ménébraz, the Living Mountain. A cold, harsh encounter, on top of high mountains, which ended by a betrayal and a beheading (also, the giant stone circle in which we started the reunion ended up being the levitating crown of the Titan, pretty cool).                        </div>

Thanks for the report! Yeah, I've seen that drawback as well. Both with orig PbtA games (even though there are so many different trappings, such as a lack of "this spell has one action casting time" affordances etc) and with my houserule. I think the pros outweight the cons but the cons are there.<br/><br/>(BTW I keep track so that there is still only one action per turn.)<br/><br/>I've found that those that came from the OSR scene with at best a d6 per side to determine who goes first can handle it fine but those who came from the 3e/4e scene have struggled a bit.<br/><br/> </div>

                            I got to play *two whole games* this week! It's amazing!<br/><br/>First up was <b>Dragon and Warrior</b>, a JRPG story game. Were there battle mechanics? Yes. Did we get XP? Of course. Did we make a bunch of homages to our favorite video games? Most definitely. <br/><br/>The game follows the story of one hero, with that role plus the other narrative roles (describing allies, enemies, settings, and treasure) switching players throughout the session. It felt a bit like passing around the controller, which I loved. It does a good job of making that type of adventure/fight-y game GMless. Of course conflict doesn't need to be violent--our main conflict of the game was trying to cross the bridge. There were a lot of "look over there!" moves, which works mechanically the same as if we were doing slashy sword moves. <br/><br/>I also had a delightful game of <b>Legend of Aesthetic</b>. The game is a masterpiece of getting you to reincorporate elements from previous moments, and if I can ever get my hands on a copy of it, it is going to be one of my go-to games.                          </div>

                            I've stopped posting in this thread b/c we play D&amp;D at few times per week (maybe "one" is the most common amount of sessions but two or three happens often) and we're still doing the same campaign since last summer. But I thought I'd drop a note to let people know that the last session yesterday we didn't have any real fights so I couldn't test out the new fight system I wrote last Monday.<br/><br/>A lot of fun dungeon exploration and trap interaction and puzzle… uh... attempting.<br/>They destroyed their rope and one of their bedrolls. I've been saying everyone needs stats, right? Not only that, but every<i>thing</i> needs stats. I was like "OK, the rope needs to make a DC 15 strength check. Someone please roll for it, it has +7 at not snapping." Drooma (a druid PCs) was like "I'm tossing in my insp on that!" giving the rope advantage and going from a 65% chance of holding to a 88% chance of holding. But dice are fickle and it still snapped♥ letting Ran (a wizard PC) get sucked in to a propeller. They had a gaseous form that I allowed; in hindsight the casting time on that is a full action, not a reaction. But I can't fix that retroactively.                        </div>

                            And today I played another session with a new group including two new players. They loved the game. And coincidentally on the train home I heard the words "short or long rest" from the next cart so I went over there and butted in and flashed my D&amp;D books and started talking D&amp;D with a group of random guys! (Seemed to be around 17yo…? #justguessing) They were on their way home after playing their first session ever! I gave them some tips ("make spare characters" being one I remember… mostly they had questions and I was like "OK we've tried doing it this way, which has these pros &amp; cons, and doing it that way, which has these pros &amp; cons, so it's a tricky problem.")<br/><br/>As far as our session I finally got to try the legendary "Holy Sword" adventure from 2012. Slightly updated for a diverse audience, I changed the word "gender" to "mer". So the orc PC got turned half mer, half orc.  A mer-orc. We had a blast, six very noisy players + one unapologetic B for a DM (i.e. yours truly) so this beer&amp;pretzel type adventure was the perfect fit<br/><br/>It was also a session that made me feel vindicated in my "never fudging" attitude since some things happened coincidentally that, because they were real, were very satisfying.<br/>The party was split and one of the two trios were getting absolutely clobbered by wraiths and just when they were about to die, the other trio finally made it back to them. And one PC did die and we had two clerics. Both knew Revivify. One had the spell slot left (Neo -Vancian™), the other had the diamond dust you need for the spell. Bam! What a perfectly satisfying climax to a long day of playing. They discovered just a fraction of what this wild &amp; unrule one-pager had to offer but we had a blast! Including sometimes getting angry <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><b>Edit:</b><br/>After the D&amp;D session we tried our hands at playing a board game as an RPG. We made backstories and drama. (It was Dead of Winter.) We all played in character as our group leader and taking special care of our own personal followers treating them as NPCs we controlled.                        </div>

I’ve never heard of this, and Google isn’t helping me find it. (Too many false positives for spells &amp; magic items.) Got a link, or an author’s name, or something, please?                         </div>

                            I played <b>Muse</b> yesterday night with my cousin, the cousin that inspired me to start writing games in the first place! We played a 3500 AD Mars Colony scenario. The protagonist Mathieu was a hyper-potato farmer (you know, giant Mars potatoes) with muscles on his muscles, and all he really wanted in life was a medal. Meanwhile, Jacques, a horribly ugly cyborg-AI hybrid, wanted to steal Mathieu's body, and Mayor Gazdan was a secret pro-Earther plotting to destroy the Martian colony. Well, Jacques failed to steal Mathieu's body, the Mayor failed in his plot and was unmasked, and our protagonist managed to get his medal for his part in stopping the Mayor.  So one of the happier endings I've seen in this game. :-D                        </div>

                            I've been at Elinacon all weekend, a small private storygames meet-up involving food &amp; friends among other things: here's what I played.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon was for facilitating <b>Blood &amp; Water</b>, and involved a woodwife, a changeling, a bridge troll, a ghoul and a werewolf trying to live in harmony together in South London. As usual, everything that could go wrong did, with the woodwife just barely managing to save her daughter from a vengeful ghoul, whilst at the same time the stopping her from ending the world; the changeling &amp; werewolf spun off into their own 'Games of Thrones' style series about courtly intrigue among the Fae; and the bridge troll was left stacking rocks, trying to make the worlds longest bridge.<br/><br/>Saturday evening I got to play <b>Monsterhearts 2</b> and picked the Hollow, outlining them as the Mortal's childhood imaginary friend brought to life to protect them. I decided the best way to do this was to stop the other students at school from taunting him for his Goth tendencies, so naturally I burned the entire senior year.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon was for <b>Something Is Wrong Here</b>, a Lynchian-storygame of delusion and surrealism. I described it as 'peculiar &amp; intense' and was one of the few story games I've really needed to decompress from for a long time: the presentation of the game was very evocative and supported the tones &amp; themes wonderfully.<br/><br/>Sunday evening ended with <b>Troublemakers</b>... for seven players! We picked 1950s rural England, on the south west coast, as the setting, with the Daredevil, Dog, Crush, Knuckle, Delinquent, Ranger and Mouth taking on Russian spies out to steal a British superweapon disguised as a haunted lighthouse with a guest appearance (or should that be guesht appearance?) from Sean Connery as James Bond.                        </div>

                            James, those are some great writeups! I enjoy reading them, short though they are.<br/><br/>This week, we continue an ongoing game of <i>My Life with Master</i>, with three fellow familiar Story Games folks (<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a>, and <a href="/forums/profile/Demiurge%29">@Demiurge)</a>, as it approaches its final conclusion. I am the Master, and they are the Minions. It's out first time trying <i>My Life with Master</i>, so it's been quite the adventure! What an interesting game (and challenging in some ways).<br/><br/>We chose a somewhat unusual "Yukon Gold Rush" setting for our game; an icy gold mine somewhere far in the North, with miners and cowboys and prostitutes and standoffs with fast-drawn pistols, but also with a touch of weird clockwork and alchemy and Native American spirit magic. It's fairly serious and dark in tone, and two of the Minions are rather more of the powerful and intimidating variety than the typical "meek and pathetic" Minion described in the text.<br/><br/>Some people I've talked feel that going with this (instead of the default/implied Gothic Eastern Europe vibe) might be losing some of the charm or mystique of the game. We've definitely struggled with this in places - the individualism of the Western genre is somewhat at odds with the static power balance and social order implied by the game itself. However, I think we're starting to find our stride with this game.<br/><br/>It's challenging for me to really "bring the Evil" as the Master (it does not come naturally to me!). The game pretty much expects you to "deprotagonize" the PCs, and that's very much against the grain of everything I normally do in gaming. However, I find release in the Connections scenes, where we get moments of kindness, beauty, or gentleness. I imagine the final confrontation will bring further catharsis.<br/><br/>We're also experimenting with slightly more diffuse narrative authority than in a typical GMed RPG - sometimes I frame scenes pretty hard, but at other times the players get a lot of say about what happens, when, and how. In this most recent session we had a really neat scene where one character used some kind of mix mystical alchemy and Native American spirit magic to establish a connection with a young boy, whose face, once half crushed by the most terrifying Minion, was saved by turning the destroyed half into a golden mask.                        </div>

<i>Started to read Good Society and having an itch to see if I could run Kerberos Club with it, particularly a somewhat darker mix.</i><br/><br/>I had much the same thought about running a Le Carre spy story with <i>GS</i> - it seems very reskinnable into a situation where all the protags know (or know of) each other and there's a standard of behavior.

<b>Stars Without Numbers Revised</b><br/><br/>After getting their asses handed to them by the inhabitants of the planet they wanted to explore, the Players spend most of this session just talking with each other onboard of their ship. Lots of blaming each other for what went wrong and dealing with the traumatic experience of getting thrown of a dam.<br/><br/>The XP system we are playtesting is really delivering the more character driven play we wanted. We are using a combination of Blades in the Darks XP questions and Hx from Apocalypse World.<br/>The BitD bits will need some more tweaking but our Hx variant especially seems to work really well.<br/><br/>SWN is an interesting game in that it seems to be the intent that you hack it into your own personal thing. I doubt that any two SWN tables  play the same game. At least we are definitely playing something very distinct from the RAW.                        </div>

                            GOAT CRASHERS, we had a big group who were trying to crash a party for the ultra rich inside a huge hexogonal tower. Got in by and things went sort of nuts.<br/><br/>There were some publicity stunt a involving eating bowls of hundred dollar bills covered in cocaine my character in particular fainted (as he was a fainting goat) and woke up with the cast from the good place. As it turns out Ted danson was working for the FBI on an undercover sting to take down criminals in the party. <br/><br/>Long story short Ted danson was added to the goat psychic Network and then was killed by the satanic goat. Which through the whole goat psychic Network into flux, my goat sacrificed himself to reconnect to the network. (He literally fainted on his sword) <br/><br/>The whole thing send off a beam of light that brought down benevolent intergalactic aliens that asked goat kind to join them and the Earth began exporting cocaine to a glowing cocaine Superior product. <br/><br/>I have no idea if this is a typical game.                        </div>

                            I played some Trollbabe last night after playing <i>a lot</i> of D&amp;D over the past two months. It took my brain a minute to switch over into the right mode, but I think the fact that I had hardly prepped anything at all was actually helpful.<br/><br/>It ended up being one of my favorite sessions, and it seemed to click for everyone at the table in a way the game never had before. At least by the end.<br/><br/>We had two Trollbabes and their adventures never intersected but unlike in previous sessions it still felt like everyone was engaged even when it wasn't their scene.<br/><br/>I think one of the most helpful changes we made to our game was how we started it. In the book it basically says that the players pick a location from the map and start the game traveling to that place on foot and eventually encounter the "stakes" of the adventure. That was alright, but this time we sat down and the players already had some ideas about what their characters wanted to do.<br/><br/>One player wanted to magically travel to realm of the elves and find the greatest bard in the universe. He told me that the elves live in a police state where they party all the time because "joy and opulence are mandatory". The other player told me she wanted to find a "mastodon trapped in amber" so she could give it as a gift to her love (a Trollbabe from a different session). The stakes ended up being about other things of course, but they were such fun ideas it really made my role a joy. I felt a lot more like a facilitator than someone "running" things.                        </div>

                            Night´s Black Agents: Unto the fourth generation. We started with crime detection. The revolutionary assassin of tsar Alexander II fled to London. Years later the russian foreign minister visits the city. In his entourage are seven members of the russian secret police (Ochrana) with the order to kill the anarchist. They are successful. Our characters are british detectives, law enforcement officials and similar figures trying to throw light on the murder. The detective is the brother-in-law of the dead. Now they detected an enclave of russian expat revolutionaries in London and a mysterious test tube with blood fell into their hands. The evidence traces back to the russian-ottoman war, maybe even further behind... but there is not much time to follow this lead - the nephew of the detective is kidnapped and the characters become more and more personally drawn into the matter (3rd session, it becomes increasingly thrilling).                        </div>

                            Last Wednesday evening we played our Yukon Gold Rush <b>My Life with Master</b> campaign, to which Paul referred above. What a great story!<br/><br/>My character (the former lawman) was tasked with his most sinister deed yet: to burn down the town's Inn. He managed to save the neighbour (from a violent drunk) and rouse the tenants beforehand. He also ended up confronting his love interest's boyfriend, and stole a promise necklace he'd left for her! That ain't over!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, one of our other PCs (the clockwork cyborg) returned to the Master's demesne to confront him for once and for all--and failed. Instead of stopping the Master, he got sent on a new mission to stop a terrorist (actually one of the Connections for 2 other PCs) from blowing up the mine.                        </div>

                            Thanks for posting about our game, <a href="/forums/profile/demiurge">@demiurge</a>. It’s been a really interesting and a lot of fun. The scene you created with Slim Messer - you’re about to destroy the man’s life and yet here you are, helping him nevertheless - was one of my favourite contributions.<br/><br/>I had a lot of trouble figuring out how Blackheart might continue to feature in the story, and whether he might have exited it altogether.<br/><br/>However, in that moment where he lifted up the revolver you’d given him, pointing it at your back, he realized that you were not his real enemy - the Master, the mine, and everything it stood for was what had brought about ruin on him and his family. Yes, you had maimed his son, but there would just be another Bush Lavender if he shot you dead, for you were ultimately just a tool for Merwin Smith. <br/><br/>And then <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> gave me a great opening for that idea by creating a psychic connection to Blackheart, at which point they influenced each other with oddly similar plans of destroying the mine (I’d come up with that plan before Dave did, as we know from the vision of Blackheart stealing away from the Haida camp with a bag full of mysterious equipment). It all came together so organically... quite a joy!                        </div>

                            LEGO storygaming again this week with the fairy, magic cat, and good witch. <br/><br/>After fleeing from the hallway with the three zombies, the fairy re-entered the first room where she had earlier turned the death knight into a frog. The magic cat (still there) decided to step on a golden circle that was in the floor. It was a teleport ring. She disappeared. Then the witch (also still there) and the fairy also decided to do the same because the fairy was still being followed by the zombies. They all teleported to different parts of the knight's manor (different rolls) since they didn't know how to control the ring. They hadn't spent much time looking at anything in the first room (this seems to be part of their gonzo approach to adventuring <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> ).<br/><br/>The cat ended up in a room with a magic door/gate on a a pedestal. It was spinning. There was a control panel. She decided to pull one of the levers. The door stop spinning and opened. She went through it, alone (very brave/foolish of her). <br/><br/>The good witch ended up in the room on the other side of the (zombie) hallway. There was a lot there to see, including a green force-field blocking an archway that she had no way to go through, but the first thing she saw was the zombies milling about in the hallway, so she hid. Unfortunately, she made some noise (partial failed roll) and the zombies started moving into the room where she was. She did find the missing princess they were looking for, though. She was in a stone-walled cell in the center of the room. The witch hid behind it. It was a pretty big room. <br/><br/>The fairy teleported to a great room with a sculpture of burning blue fire. There were also ghosts there circling the flames. They were enough for her to want to leave, immediately.  She ran to the nearest end of the room where there was a green force-field blocking the exit. Using her magical lock/unlock (it probably shouldn't have worked in this situation, but GM fiat*), she stepped through into the room with the witch, princess, and zombies. Chaos ensued.<br/><br/>The fairy used her magic to unlock the princess's cell door which opened, but that only made the princess start screaming, which attracted the zombies. The fairy turned two of the three zombies into frogs but the farthest one still remained. The princess ran into the arms of the fairy (who is human-sized, btw) with the last zombie close behind. Meanwhile, the witch was quickly making a potion to change the last zombie into a frog (they are fixated on turning things into frog, at the moment). The fairy, princess, and zombie all met in a narrow place near between the force-field and the cell, near where the witch was hiding. The witch threw her potion at the zombie (but partlly failed the roll). Unfortunately, she hit the zombie AND the princess, who both turned into frogs (interesting fairy tale reversal!). <br/><br/>[cut to the cat]<br/>The final scene was with the cat, who had teleported to a beach. She was face-to-face with a blue-skinned humanoid riding a tiger and carrying a large, transparant, pink umbrella, and a pail. There was a recently built sand castle between them. Wisely, the magical cat asked the blue-skinned humanoid for help. Blue-skin agreed, but there will be a price for helping (hook for the next adventure). [/end session]<br/><br/>*The girls were having fun. I wasn't going to quibble about whether her magic lock/unlock worked on force-fields. That would have killed the gonzo momentum they were developing.<br/><br/>We're using a <i>Yes, and; No, but</i> system for this.<br/><br/>Sorry, this was so long. I will probably start a separate thread for this AP.                        </div>

                            The hin gloom stalker's wife has a magic cello that can create a cottage where they can rest. And the cello got completely submerged in red wine for somewhere between 3 and 20 minutes. And to resolve whether or not the cello still worked I called a musician friend and let him settle it. I didn't tell him the sides or the stakes, just asked whether the cello would still work. And he said he believed so, if she retuned it. And that's not hard to do, even on a fretless, it's just fifths. She keeps it at CGDA. <small>(California Guitarists Drop Acid.)</small><br/><br/>This is a fantastic game.<br/><br/>This was an "ice moon" situation, I thought it was a TPK for sure. Which I discussed openly with them.  I was like "As far as <i>I</i> know, this might very well be it. I can't think of a way out of this. New chars, or…?" But since they could get their cottage they could rest and get new spells. By a weird combination of spells including… guidance‽!? and bardic inspiration…?! they managed to get out of their conundrum. It was a real drakar&amp;bananer challenge, except legit, &amp; with mechanics. "Physics" (except the weird-ass physics of spells and magic cellos).<br/><br/>It was a great session of tangibility, of doing math on liquid volumes, on reading up discussions of spell effects on Stack Exchange, and of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Also we ruled that lesser restoration spell can sober up your lantern ghost if she gets too drunk but is not enough to de-goatify your enby hin evoker jester if they get goatified.<br/><br/>I felt really vindicated in this DM style. This is exactly the sort of game I really really value the most. "Mirror story" style.<br/><br/>Also in the session they were fighting a monster and I thought it was so obvi that they'd win that I at first was like "OK, you can split 700 xp" and they were like "ok, yeah, we can just defeat it…?" which sometimes we do when they are kiting or w/e and the pretty monster can't really do anything. But we talked it out and decided that OK we'll have to roll it out. It is actually a dangerous and non-obvious, even if likely, victory. And the gloom stalker did almost die. In the end they didn't really expend resources, but they <i>risked</i> dying. Also, rolling out the fight was FAST. The new fighting system feels fast to me. Not the world's biggest fight — the boys (a hin gloom stalker and a moon dwarve) vs a CR 3 creature while the other two hin kept the fort under control in the magical cello cottage. But it was made more complicated because they had to hold their breath.                        </div>

                            Untold: adventures await. <br/>I haven’t been frequenting this site for a while. Fun to see what some of you have been doing. My gaming has pretty much dried up. I play a 2x/month thing w some very old school gamers. They are all about min maxing and rules over narrative. I’m surprised to discover that this is moderately fun for me. Still I’d rather play a story game that encourages shared imagination any day. So I was really thrilled with a recent experience with this Rory story cubes game. It was great!<br/>We played an alternate steamgrunge Seattle story.                         </div>

                            I didn't like the prototype version of Untold but the final version has a lot of polish and is straight up a really good story game. I've played it a bunch. It kinda sits in that uncomfortable space of using story game mechanics [why this game is so underdiscussed here on S-G is kinda weird, it is really good, mechanically] for adventure game tropes. But overall I love it.<br/><br/>Paul, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/481977/#Comment_481977" rel="nofollow">see here</a> </div>

                            Yikes, it’s been a while guys. I’m sorry. Real life and stuff. In any case, I played a game again, it was with kids again. BUT it was not in class and I was not a GM. I wasn’t even aware we’d be roleplaying as the kid in question just invented a game on the spot, in a train. <br/><br/>He drew a labyrinth (and I wasn’t allowed to watch) which I had to solve. First time around, that was all, second time around he included dragons, doors that could only be opened by solving a riddle (mostly, “what number am I thinking about” between a range of numbers, different every time, but also like questions where I had to guess things about him choosing from two options). When a riddle was solved I’d get bonus points that could be exchanged for “powers”.<br/><br/>I encountered one of the dragons and used my LASER POWER on it, which he ruled distracted it and made it run away (like a freaking cat with a laser pointer) ruling that when I would meet it again, it would have found something and made it be a MEGA DRAGON.<br/><br/>We didn’t manage to finish it, but it was very fun.<br/><br/>This kid is seven years old. I am still amazed.                        </div>

<i>Played a bunch of D&amp;D Tomb of Annihilation + ten thousand house rules as always, but also</i> a couple of sessions of The Hollow Wood with a friend, a… kinda crappy story game but the sessions were good.

Both session were good but we were thinking the specificity of the cards were kinda pointless.

                            Played some more fifth edition D&amp;D last night. We had a new player join which great, and they all decided to go back to the <i>Tomb of the Serpent Kings</i> which I was even more excited about (I like that module)! At one point they broke into a tomb and nearly died from a lightning trap only to find the stone coffin inside was totally empty. "Well that was anti climactic", was the general consensus. Previously I would have probably added something to the coffin on the spot but I'm trying to just let things ride and see what happens. That said pretty much <i>none</i> of the coffins have treasure in them in this module?? I might have tweaked that if I had read the whole thing more carefully, feels weird to me. Anyway empty coffins aside I think everyone had a pretty good time.<br/><br/>The night before I also played some Trollbabe, but it didn't feel as smooth as the last session we had. One player keeps coming up with "acquire this item from this exotic location" as a goal for his character, and I just can't seem to find much complexity or excitement in that. He's actually bringing a lot of cool ideas to the game so I feel bad that I can't meet him with any interesting stakes... At least I have a better idea of the kind of stuff he's interested in now, maybe it will make it easier to brainstorm some options.                        </div>

"Climactic" is a term used for narrative arcs; you're not supposed to be building a narrative arc, you're offering a trip to a dangerous and exciting world♥♥♥<br/><br/>That way, when awesome story stuff happens, they <b>happen</b>, rather than are just being told as part of a tale. Of course they then become fodder for tales that live on for a long time. The "gazebo story" was in the seventies, the "mirror story" was in… oh, has it been almost seven years already? <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23old2097&amp;Mode=like">#old2097</a>

I think I actually agree with you, but I'd put it another way. I think anticlimax is itself narratively interesting and absolutely not something I would have included on my own unless I was playing the game in the systematized way that I was. It's like if I had mixed this cookie batter myself I would have only put chocolate chips in, not all these dumb walnuts. Except by following this other recipe I got to find out that having more than one flavor is cool, and the walnuts give a nice crunch. Ok never mind what am I talking about.

Actually now that you mention it, I did do that. But usually this player tends to just walk away from stuff that I make non-obvious or morally ambiguous and picks a new goal. Probably would require more context (like a threads worth) to dissect if I could be doing more there, but I think it would be more efficient to just try and talk to him about it first.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/ebear">@ebear</a>,<br/><br/>That sounds like a difficult problem, you and the player being on entirely different wavelengths. Perhaps it’s worth starting a new thread about that! A tricky challenge/situation.                         </div>

                            Played <b>The Goose of Grillner Grove</b> with my in-laws! It was very silly, but a fun short game. We tweaked the rules a little to remove the GM and replace that role with a character role (the visitor).

                            I played two turns of a very strange and baroque board game called “Kingdom Death”. What a wild beast that is!<br/><br/>It’s got a lot of RPG adjacent stuff in it, like characters who progress in power, story events with random outcomes, and the development of a community (a sort of town) as you play.                        </div>

                            I played the finale of a seven session Torchbearer adventure.  Torchbearing has taken a back seat in my RPG life while I've been developing my own games, so it's been good to get back to it.  The adventure is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1blI0CJJTG0OPg33BarHfuRC6rtufSsb7pQ_PTojAiwg/edit" rel="nofollow">Floating Castle Ardmore </a>by Shane King.  It's been a great Miyazaki-like high adventure.<br/><br/>I always surprise myself with how much character advancement systems keep me invested in long-term play.  My magician will level next session and go through a winter phase with a full coffer, which in Torchbearer may be even more valuable.                        </div>

                            I started running Masks: a New Generation and have had some player turnover, which is always awkward in PBTA games because the departing player leaves behind some of their prep and I feel obliged to tell the new guy that they should try to play with the elements we already have on the table and not add too many new ones. (Personally, I love a challenge like that, but I'm aware most people don't.)                        </div>

                            I ran <b>Masks: a New Generation</b>. The heroes are pursuing an ex-PC that disappeared, and of course, nothing is going like I expected.

                            Playing the Tainted in an Urban Shadows game. The Oracle brought in an ordinary mortal to... well, as I saw it, to help with something that didn't need help, but okay. The Fae thought it'd be a good idea.<br/><br/>And after, when the mortal saw too much stuff, my Tainted figured the solution was obvious. Shower mortal with praise, commend their common sense, buy them several drinks, maybe give them money. It was the Wizard who, after someone tossed around the term "magic", decided to explain that magic was code for *shows gun*. At which point, Tainted just handed mortal money for "hazard pay", but hey, still not a problem.<br/><br/>Only now the Oracle felt guilty, so the Wizard decided to suggest just wiping their friend's mind of the last hour. The Oracle decided this was best.<br/><br/>I found this hilarious. I mean, my Tainted's willing to commit all manner of foul deeds to keep the City safe, if necessary, but really, why are we jumping there as step <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> or so? Ply the helpful, if out of their depth, soul with drinks and money. Why complicate things?<br/><br/>The other hilarious bit was the running joke about the Fae searching for someone.<br/><br/>"He's on the East River."<br/><br/>"Oh that's -- wait, on, not in? That's a good sign."                        </div>

                            8th session of our death mystery themed homebrew PbtA game called <b>Catacombatan</b>. A few lessons learned:<br/>1. PbtA games really really starts to shine over multiple sessions!<br/>2. Actively coming up with hooks and options to do for PCs every session (influence: 13th Ages) initially sounded as an interesting idea but its a heavy burden for me as an MC and established a bad attitude where players mostly react to my prep and do less proactive stuff!<br/>3. In 'trad' games where I have to prep I often fall into a trap by madly trying to 'serve others taste' which turns prep into a chore or work. I know that the solution is evident to a lot of people but I really had to force myself to put things which I am interested in into my game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The ideas all came up on the bus to the cafe where we play and throwing them into the game was risky but I think it brought some fresh air and momentum!<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/>1. Trying to strangle a PC on a romantic lake floating by her assassin lover. It was soo epic!<br/>2. A honorable PC surprisedel me by opting out from a weird looking assassination attempt and by that she learned that it was a trap! Now she has the upper hand in her organization!<br/>3. The only male PCs weakness made him fck up the most important spiritual transcending attempt in the setting but he also learned that there might be also some kind of conspiracy avtively sabotaging it so it is not (just) his fault.<br/><br/>We also tried out <b>The Lodger</b>, a horror party RPG. We rolled well and managed to wipe out the sinister Lodger in 3 days (45 minutes) which turned the original creepiness into a 'it looks like a horror movie but actually its just a rotting cat corpse between walls' type of hipster meta-horror movie <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>Although I still liked it but using the optional daily drama rules is highly recommended!                        </div>

Me too! But I think we're doing great. I have no doubt my music will heal my beloved's hollow soul. Just you wait and see.                        </div>

                            Love in the Time of Seið. The Jarl leads the forces of the king into battle. He wants to come back as victor, marry the Princess and become the new King. The Seiðkona is willing to support him in battle, his further plans she declines. At home the old King broods over the past. Many years ago he killed his brother to inherit the throne, but the ghosts of remorse never let him calm down. At least, the Princess and the Knight form an alliance against the Jarl... but during a meeting by moonlight, the Princess realizes, that her beloved Knight is a lycanthrope. We have great fun but need a second session to finish the game.                        </div>

                            Played more Space Without Master, discovered some nefarious plots going on in the universe, that tie disparate elements of the setting together. <br/><br/>And an assassin managed to sabotage the PC's ship by custom printing stickers that messed with the neural circuits of the ship's repair robot. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41845878" rel="nofollow">By changing one or two pixels slightly</a>, the AI was convinced that the ship's engines were missing and had been mysteriously replaced with apple pie.

                            Got to play in a session of Goblinville for a podcast recording.  It was fun seeing someone GM the game just from reading the game text.  Great GMing and great fellow players.<br/><br/>It was kind of intimidating, since I knew the GM from his game (<i>The Indie Hack</i>) and some of the players from their work (<i>Girl Underground</i> and <i>Codex</i>) but it's always fun to play with people who are very tuned in to what makes for good table culture.  There was a very collaborative spirit and good reincorporation of things the other players introduced.                        </div>

                            Played two sessions from the same game of A Thousand Years Under the Sun. It's not a long game but we are playing during lunch break, so three short sessions.  It's a fun game, even though we are bad at drawing. With two players, and only ten turns each, we have started a lot of arcs that won't see their apices. The game probably works best with four or more players (as many as seven or eight). <br/><br/>We are using the map we create for the start of our upcoming Archipelago game/campaign. One neat thing about ATYUTS is that it generates NPCs as well as a map and a history. If you use all the arcs that's more that 50 NPCs, of which many will be part of the setting history. We haven't done the best job keeping track of them all. Some have been lost to history.<br/><br/>Our map contains a tribe of crocodile-hunters, some bear-worshipping neandertals, some Amazons, some chariot-barbarians (wiped out by the Amazons), a splinter group of dark-worshipping Amazonian cultists, a Tolkien-esque wizard in a dark tower, a sea god, and an Empire of Light (which is off the map edge).                        </div>

                            Night´s Black Agents: Unto the fourth generation. Instead of conducting a polite conversation with the victorian wirepuller of a kidnapper ring in a fine carriage, our detective shockingly screamed at him, intimidated him and shot him twice... at the Marble Arch in public! Latish it became clear, that his opponent is a member of the House of Lords. All the man wanted from the player characters was a dubious test tube with blood. Ridiculous! Of course, the characters have no evidence for his crime. Now our detective is behind bars and his friends have to find the kidnapped child of his sister by themselves. Do we have an execution next time?                        </div>

                            I played a game of <b>Muse</b> with my coworkers. This time it's a strictly realistic (no magic or sci-fi) setting of plagues, chaos, philanthropists and billionaire cannibal conspiracies (a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory" rel="nofollow">Pizzagate</a>). We used real-life actors and celebrities for all of the main characters! It's hilarious to play, but I'm not sure how savoury it is to write about here. I know, I'll try to protect the famous people's identities!<br/><br/>The story so far: a certain ex-vice president was inducted into the cannibal conspiracy so they could use his <i>algorithm</i> (see if you can use this pun to figure out his identity, <i>groan</i>) to help spread a plague and discredit a rival billionaire inventor. Simultaneously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News" rel="nofollow">Breitbart</a> broadcast propaganda on a manufactured <i>Elongate</i> scandal regarding this inventor (can you guess who the inventor is yet? Hint: it's another name pun). We've had at least 2 or 3 people get eaten alive by billionaire cannibals so far. The billionaires file their teeth to points to make it easier to eat raw flesh, and wear fake teeth on top (like reverse Halloween vampires). Finally, our 3rd main character (you may know her as the neuroscientist from The Big Bang Theory, and yet she is also a neuroscientist in real life!) was fighting to stop the plague and got gunned down in a clever cannibal contrivance. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>  Who will save humanity from the plague now?<br/><br/>In other news, we're still trying to organize our next game of <b>My Life With Master</b>!                        </div>

                            Playtested a new Goblinville adventure on Saturday, evading Rock Trolls and out-scrambling mountain goats.<br/><br/>Then ran the second half of a small Torchbearer adventure.  An old, weary elf was convinced to once again kill for the greater good.  A scrappy urchin joined the party and scraped together enough gold to remove a curse that had turned her hand to stone.  Classic stuff!                        </div>

                            Ran a brief Itras By session in Seattle. The PCs were a sentient piece of toast, a headshrinker who fitted hats by shrinking the heads as needed, a judge who locked works of art up (no, not the artists -- he was an ART judge, not an ARTIST judge), a woman who could make what she wanted come to pass and really didn't want that power, and a little girl looking for her missing balloon or something even more wondrous. Also, Gimbels opened a store in Itras By.                        </div>

<p>OK session 62 of Tomb of A but I usually don’t post about it since we play several times per week but tonight was especially awesome!!!!</p><p>Since first session both with <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/inspiration/" rel="nofollow">new inspiration rules</a> and with new fighting rules (write-up WIP).</p><p>First a nice dinner date with one of the dorx! Unfortunately eating &amp; washing up ate into a bit of our playing time &amp; I feel bad af about that.</p><p>Then we had decided to do a “dream fight” to teach the new fighting rules, going over them carefully &amp; then playing out a fight “in dreams”. Sorted out snafus and made changes based on the text. Even after so many things that were awkward &amp; wrong the players were STOKED!!</p><p>Then in the actual game, wow… one of the best “Hillfolk” scenes we’ve had ever; the Gloom Stalker is cursed so that he magically can only speak the truth. It’s been that way for eleven sessions (four days diegetically — yes they really conserve lamp oil and food now so they eke out every minute). So today the party finally deduced that the Gloom Stalker had this curse. So War Cleric asks “Do you think I’m hot?” The Gloom Stalker is married to Lore Bard (their characters are! not a couple IRL). Gloom Stalker says “I’d rather not answer that question.” Lore Bard says telepathically to her husband “Go on, honey. I’m sure we’d all want to know!” and Gloom Stalker finally after long awkward silence says <small>“yes”</small>. Most well-earned drama token of all time!</p><p>Then there was some puzzle solving; didn’t finish the puzzle but they found an ingenious way to get a great clue.</p><p><strong>Content warning: violence!</strong></p><p>Then there was a fight vs a quartet of four-armed-gargoyles with the new system which was…. OH WOW!! we made some minor mistakes, much fewer than I hought, but <em>wow</em>!!!! The spending hitpoints thing that <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> came up with worked great!</p><p>Fighter: I’m rolling away from the garg!<br/>DM: OK, make four defense rolls DC 18!"<br/>Fighter: I made three of them!<br/>DM: Three of his arms go KLONK KLONK KLONK into the stone behind you as you roll away but the fourth one reaches over you towards your face, <em>what do you do?</em><br/>Fighter: I roll laterally, to the side!<br/>DM: Ok, you can spend 9 hitpoints to do that!</p><p>That was kinda the flow we fell into!</p><p>When you couldn’t spend, that’s when you got hurt!</p><p>Our war cleric narrated sweeping two arms aside with her shield and the other two aside with her morning star. She succeeded on two defense rolls—the shield block was effective, but the two arms on the morning star side could reach around the star easily; what do you do? She said she tried to step over to the shield side some more, away from the arms</p><p>“OK, you can spend 18 hp to do that”<br/>“I don’t have that!”<br/>“Then roll an injury!”<br/>“9”<br/>“Crush as the arms break your ribs!”<br/>“Uh, btw, I’m also down!”</p><p>(don’t worry she later got healing-worded, healing the ribs&amp;bringing her back into the fight.)</p><p>So we have 5 players + DM (six chars; the lore bard is a second character of one of the players).</p><p>Three of the players stoked af, including the two usually most hard-to-please ones. They were standing up and cheering!!! People were leaving their chairs larping around like animals!!!</p><p>The fourth player not really into the fact that fights (the boringest part for this player) now take MUCH more time.</p><p>The fifth player really supportive but also concerned that they were being cheated out of actions turn-order-wise. They weren’t &amp; I have docs &amp; action tracker to prove that, but I think this is a player that needs to grok the rules to feel comfortable &amp; have buy-in. And I hope &amp; think that’s possible.</p><p>Don’t continue the discussion in this thread (as per directed for “What did you play this week” thread)</p><ul><li><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22060/d-d-2097e-remapping-diegesis-mimesis-and-all-kinds-of-sis#latest" rel="nofollow">Questions/comments about HP spend go here</a></li><li><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22067/d-d5e-without-the-action-economy#latest" rel="nofollow">Question/comments about turn order chaos go here</a></li><li><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22033/what-if-mechanics-were-subordinate-to-game-play-as-opposed-to-directive#latest" rel="nofollow">If this brings to mind Sil’s style, the currently open thread for that is here</a></li></ul> </div>

                            Recently, our players <i>finally</i> stopped hanging out with famous people so we could play <b>My Life With Master</b>! Oh yeah!<br/><br/>My minion PC, Bush the former lawman, burned down a tenement at the Master's request. He did his best to save the occupants, and brought one of the victims to the town's infirmary. Bush promised that he would stop "the Boss" for once and for all. One of the other victims identified Bush as the arsonist, and Bush left the building, filled with steely determination.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there was a major drama between Darren the alchemical golem and Blackheart, one of the townspeople whose family had been banished from town. Blackheart had been trying to blow up the mine (the one providing the town with gold), but Darren disarmed him (almost literally). The Master arrived and ordered Darren to bring Blackheart back to the Master's demesne. Darren was forced to comply, but he secretly left a lit torch next to the explosives that Blackheart had set up!<br/><br/>Our third PC, Galilee the fearful child, was being led to the Master's demesne after having been AWOL for a long time. <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the next session, as I have a surprise in store...<br/> </div>

                            I'm also glad the game is back on, and moving towards its inevitable conclusion. It's been fun to try to play such a heavily GM-led game while leaving a lot of space for the players to introduce material and set scenes, and it's felt really good to me when that balance has been well received. I'm really enjoying how you and Dave are using those opportunities to add stuff to the fiction and develop characters and storylines. <br/><br/>Looking forward to your "surprise"! Bush has a moment of freedom, both in terms of the character's situation and in terms of your ability as a player to dictate what we might focus on next, so I encourage you to take advantage of that. He's made a number of enemies in Treadwell who are likely to come looking for him or to get in his way (like Rorik, Gil, and Cobb, as well as Luce), and Clementine is still in the Master's demesne, awaiting whatever purpose he needs her for. The town is aflame and tensions are high. Anything could happen!                        </div>

                            Instead of Dracula references the campaign deals with greek mythology. I like that, too.<br/>The (ghostly) vampires are a different, interesting bunch of enemies.<br/>The campaign consists of five adventures. Some of them are really great (Paris), others are good, too, but not exactly to my taste (Russia).<br/>The characters could be in heavy combat situations more frequently than in other Night´s Black Agents publications. (This is only a first impression.)<br/>The single adventures are not as interlinked as in other publications ("The Zalozhniye Quartet", "Dracula Dossier"), but you can remove this fly in the ointment easily.<br/>I´d start with another story, but I think "The Persephone Extraction" is a good alternative for a second or third experience with "Night´s Black Agents").                        </div>

                            I got to run the Barrowmaze megadungeon using Knave for some new players (and one regular) over the weekend. I liked both the module and the system better than I thought I would. The Knave traits tables were really fun for everyone when creating their characters, and everyone ended up with at least one memorable thing about them that helped me picture the character in my mind.<br/><br/>I also got a help someone local play test their cyberpunk PbtA (powered by the apocalypse) game last night. It was really fun! I haven't been a player very many times so it was cool to take on that role. Also it was a 1:1 session which I haven't tried in a long time but I thought it worked out really well.                        </div>

                            Monsterhearts where the Infernal's now committed a murder for her Dark Power, the Witch and the Ghost agree that the Witch's mother and the Ghost's father are trying to marry far too quickly and must be stopped, the Serpentine is trying to use the growing up moves she got last season to help people.<br/><br/>This last was amusing because at one point, she had two conditions: Stone Cold Capitalist and Freak. The player loved the first because it is more useful than harmful -- but when making an impassioned speech calling people on their shit and using Freak to bump the result up to a 10, well, that removed that condition, at least for now. This rather nicely sums up her central conflict, I think.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Witch's father's dealing with the Serpentine's aunt for power. He's been jealous of his son for quite some time, but hey, now he has power too! The Witch's girlfriend and mentor is ill, and no one involved in worrying about that is yet certain whether this is natural or not. Meanwhile, no one knows what the Infernal's done and are more worried about the Dark Power doing things that, well, he isn't doing.<br/><br/>Arguably, he's got a string on the Witch who asked him to get the Infernal to comfort her crying sister, as the Witch didn't want to deal with that himself, but neither was he willing to leave the sister alone with the Dark Power.<br/><br/>All of this took place during a day of mock trial by combat because the Infernal, who used to be the Werewolf, doesn't understand why things aren't just settled with fighting and strength, and this debate in history class turned into a School Event. No actual fighting, just competitions from debates to track races to poetry writing -- and bribing the judges is explicitly allowed.                        </div>

                            A bounty of gaming washed over my home this week!<br/><br/>I did an inaugural playtest of an unnamed game about ecological crisis that I'm working on. Turns out you shouldn't cut down all the trees on the floating tree island you live on? This session ruled because I had 3 players with very little story-gaming experience, one with absolutely no RPG experience. Everyone had a great time, especially the new person. Story gaming blew her mind. <br/><br/>Then I got to playtest Marc's current project, <b>Epitaph</b>. We explored the life and death of a humble man who wanted to write a cookbook, but could never bring himself to finish it. I'm super excited about this game--I think it tells some really interesting and thoughtful stories. <br/><br/>Finally we did session 1 of <b>Kingdom</b>!

But I’ve tried to remain calm (this is our first time spending this much time at this high a level; we’ve only done shorter stuff at this level before). Because <em>when</em> a PC dies, that’s gonna sting. That’s gonna have a <em>lot</em> of impact. I’m OK with that not happening. My philosophy being “they die anyway” and the feeling that D&amp;D is kinda self-balancing just like a good JRPG [like Gaudia Quest] is; not by any sort of adfudgement or scaling by me as DM but just by the basic nature of you steamrolling your way forward if you’re over-leveled and you slowing down af when you’re under-leveled. Such and such being OP? “Don’t worry, Sandra,” I’d tell myself. “They die anyway”. And today that came to pass for the first time in two weeks diegetically, 26 sessions extradiegetically (and 168 days extradiegetically – almost half a year without any PC deaths!). A couple of henches has died though.</p><p>I think it’s a <i>good</i> thing that they don’t die so often. In our side campaign at lower levels there has been plenty of deaths though.</p> </div>

                            That's fantastic! I sometimes really miss the "reality" of character death in games where character death isn't on the table, so I can really relate to that. Thanks!                        </div>

                            First TPK of this campaign (and it was session 66 so I can't believe it's been this long). Not first TPK with the group, but with this partic campaign (that otoh is our longest campaign by about ×3 times our previous record [so far]; over a year). We had two absent players tonight so it's not a literal *total* party kill, but everyone who was present got gone.<br/><br/>You folx remember the "mirror story" right? <i>[Yes, Sandra, you talk about it all the time]</i><br/><br/>This was a different module but a very similar magic mirror. I didn't put it in there and I didn't know of it when I selected the module [I <i>had</i> read ahead so I knew it was there]. And instead of them taking the mirror or whatever, here is what happened.<br/><br/>As soon as they got in the room with the mirror, I let them know that it's there. I <i>don't</i> presuppose that any of them are looking in it. I say that they see the reflection of their own torch light. Alice says: "I'm looking away! I always avert my eyes when I see mirrors in dungeons".<br/><br/>Bob (who is holding the torch) says "I look in the mirror, what do I see?"<br/><br/>I hand him a note that he reads. He rolls a die and shakes his head. Alice and Carol have no idea what's on the note and what's in the mirror.<br/><br/>I say "Alice, Carol, suddenly you're standing in the dark"<br/><br/>They're like "Was the torch snuffed out, or?"<br/><br/>I say "One moment you saw it, both in the room and a glint of it reflected, but now you're standing in the dark."<br/><br/>"Are we in the same room, or were we teleported, or what?"<br/><br/>"You don't know."<br/><br/>They fish out a new torch and tinderbox it up. Alice doesn't have a tinderbox, but Carol does.<br/><br/>Carol says "I look in the mirror".<br/><br/>I hand her the note that Bob had read. She rolls a die and says no.<br/><br/>I say to Alice "It went dark again. You're alone"<br/><br/>Followed confused larping and feeling their way around the pitch black room. Way too many "wait wait I'm confused let's start over, *where* are you exactly?" Uh... working your way in a dark room is hard you guys!<br/><br/>And then she says "OK I have sussed out where the mirror is, right? It's dark. I look into it."<br/><br/>I hand her the mysterious note.<br/><br/>It says...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>..."Make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw."<br/><br/>Then we spend the rest of the night rolling up new chars.<br/><br/><a href="http://users.rider.edu/~suler/zenstory/silence.html" rel="nofollow">Four monks decided to meditate silently without speaking for two weeks.</a> By nightfall on the first day, the candle began to flicker and then went out. The first monk said, "Oh, no! The candle is out." The second monk said, "Aren't we not suppose to talk?" The third monk said, "Why must you two break the silence?"

The setting didn't really inspire me either.  But the blurbs about the types of campaigns made me make my own for the playtest.  I'm using Eberron in a Black Company type campaign.  I love the system, and the players seem to also.  I've been writing it up, but they told me not to widely share my writeup, even though they suggested streaming the game via Twitch, which was disappointing.                        </div>

                            The torch got petrified I guess. And players thought the mirror was a portal (and would follow their party members through a volcano).                         </div>

                            So, in Monsterhearts, there's this plot that's coming to a boil, and the PCs are getting together to deal with it. Except the Witch (Battler) had hexed the Infernal (formerly the Werewolf) (Margot) so she can't harm anyone including herself, so she was angry at him and threw a bunch of ineffective punches at him saying what he'd did while he tried to weasle (you know, "I don't know what you're talking about" when it's bleeping obvious she knows what he did -- which both players agree is the case, you understand).<br/><br/>The Serpentine (formerly the Queen) (Viridian) who removed her Condition Fallen Queen, but still has Weird and Nerd is finding these a benefit in her competition with the Ghost (Chris) over the same girl. But she's also trying to be a grown up and call the Infernal on her shit, so she said, "So, you know how Battler is always trying to solve problems with magic, and that's wrong? Well, you always try to solve them with violence, and that's also wrong."<br/><br/>And the Infernal broke down in tears.<br/><br/>Witch (having trouble parsing this): Margot? ... Are you... crying?<br/><br/>The Ghost tried to comfort her, mostly patting her shoulder, only occasionally patting through it.<br/><br/>The Infernal sobbed and gave the Witch the finger.<br/><br/>And it was the most perfect moment in the game tonight.<br/><br/>(Oh yes, they did get back to the plot, and the Witch is going to have to decide whether or not to unhex the Infernal (who has Volatile +3) to deal with... Stuff when he's entangled with the Stuff, as is the Serpentine. But that can wait.)                        </div>

                            Our game of <i>My Life with Master</i> continues. In the cold northern Yukon gold rush, icy water, gold, greed, and fire seem to be the main ingredients.<br/><br/>Bush Lavender, one of the Master’s enforcers, the man who burned down the town’s Inn and the old tenement where the Master’s nephew was living in hiding, a man who has recently lost an eye... is ordered to bring two people with him into a locked room. It’s him, the woman he loves, and the man <i>she</i> loves.<br/><br/>No one leaves the room until someone loses a hand, says the Master. “It’s up to you who it is, Bush.”<br/><br/>He wheels in a table with a two-foot long bonesaw.<br/><br/>Without hesitation, Bush starts to slice off his left hand. Fortunately, the saw is very sharp.<br/><br/>The young lovers might be able to escape. But how can Bush face the Master with only one eye and one hand?<br/><br/>With thanks to <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">@Demiurge</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a>, and <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a>.                        </div>

                            Trial run of the first of three Pelgrane scenarios I'm running at DexCon, "Doors to Heaven". Overall went well, and time management solid, but I need to make a few things clearer, be ready to tweak one or two things as needed, and correct for a particular inconsistency in the rules (as opposed to the scenario). That said, I like the way Yellow King streamlines combat and replaces numbers in Investigation skills with Pushes, and I really like the feel of the Paris setting.<br/><br/>For Reasons, the artists had to bind the arms of an NPC fellow artist, and decided to bring him to his friends. So, first, they put a large coat on him, and then one of the artists took off his tie and put it on the friend as if it were a leash.<br/><br/>Artist 1 (handing leash to the the one woman in the group) (the pregens have gender neutral names, which is great): Here. Now no one will think it's strange.<br/><br/>Artist 2 (who is definitely not heterosexual): Point. (takes leash, subtly alters clothing to look like prostitute)<br/><br/>After a quick and delicately edited version of just what had happened, the PCs convinced the NPCs to take custody of their fellow artist.<br/><br/>Artist 2's Player: I remove the tie, give it back to [Artist 1], and subtly alter my clothing so I no longer look like a prostitute.<br/><br/>Artist 3: ... How- How did you _do_ that?<br/><br/>Artist 2: Fashion!<br/><br/>(Why yes, there is a Fashion skill, and the artist had it. Oh Paris!)<br/><br/>And more wine was consumed. And absinthe.

                            Urban Shadows, as a player. The Wizards' Council is currently controlled by an evil faction and is doing evil, but we may be about to stop them. The mayor jumped into the tiger exhibit at the zoo and lost a hand to the tigers, but we managed to save her, though not stop medics from taking her to... some hospital somewhere. Someone's pulling her strings, as she's been ranting about the supernatural and stepped down in favor of... someone (she didn't name the person before diving into the tiger exhibit). And someone must have done something to make her seem particularly tasty to the tigers. And there may be a Fae war. And the Vampires and Werewolves are pretty much already at war.<br/><br/>So yeah, just a regular Monday in the city.                        </div>

                            Tonight, we wrapped a pretty long-playing game/campaign of My Life with Master.<br/><br/>It's been mentioned before in this thread: a sprawling sort of mini-epic set in Gold Rush-era Yukon, cold rushing river, gold mine, Native magic, and alchemy.<br/><br/>It was beautiful and tragic.<br/><br/>If you're a sensitive soul, I'd advice you not to read too much further: there was some gruesome business in between the moments of beauty and heart.<br/><br/>Details here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22155/we-finally-play-my-life-with-master-after-game-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22155/we-finally-play-my-life-with-master-after-game-report</a><br/> </div>

                            This weekend was Origins, so I played a lot of RPGs in the Games on Demand room and a few things outside GoD. <br/><br/>I playtested <i><b>Rusałka</b></i> my tragic game of fairy tale water spirits, several times. Each time it makes a sad little series of stories that interlink in surprising ways. No one in this game ever gets what they want, and that is beautiful. Except for one game I played one-on-one with a friendly rabbi just as the Sabbath was ending. In that game, there were a surprising number of happy endings. I wonder why that game turned out differently.<br/><br/>I also played <i><b>Psi*Run</b></i>, which was fun and engaging. One player had a habit of blurting out excellent answers to people's questions well before the dice said we were supposed to answer those questions. And I made a few bad calls as GM, but not enough to ruin anyone's enjoyment (as far as I can tell). In the end, one PC turned out to be a former member of the Chasers, and when another PC used mass hypnosis to pull the Chasers into a deadly trap, the former Chaser got hypnotized as well. So he wound up dying in the big final sequence, along with most of the antagonist NPCs.<br/><br/>I got to play <a href="http://www.jwalton.media/#/restless/" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Walton's game <i><b>Restless</b></i></a> after wanting to for years. even though I dislike zombie stories and post-apocalyptic stories, I found this game very interesting and engaging for the ways that it structures the story and gameplay. Plus, more tragic deaths, including two instances of a player character accidentally shooting and killing another PC. (I think the only people or things that were shot the entire session were other PCs by tragic mistake).<br/><br/>And finally, I played a game of <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/273947/Scouts-of-the-Wyrdwood-Forest--Playtest-Preview" rel="nofollow"><i><b>Scouts of the Wyrdwood Forest</b></i></a> with my children. It's a fun kids' adventure game, focused on teamwork and problem solving through nonviolent means. So that's pretty cool. And especially cool is that you have adults play talking animal sidekicks that give advice and help to the scouts played by child players. That's a smart way to set up the game so that adults and kids can play together.                        </div>

                            One-shot of <i>Night Witches</i>, with one player who'd been my <i>Good Society</i> game, one player who had <i>Dungeon World </i>experience, and one player who was brand new. <br/><br/>-	I burned through a *lot* of plot, mostly because I was nervous and wound up rushing the resolution of day scenes. In retrospect, I think I did 6 day/night cycles, or one per 20 minutes. This was in sharp contrast to the examples I’ve seen and my own plans, which should be closer to one hour (or more) per day/night cycle. <br/>-	They had more fun than I expected with the bombing raids, but did seem to realize the stakes. Over the long term, I think the night raids would have been a major source of tension. <br/>-	They got immediately: how Marks work, how Harm works, the role of the Zealot, the sexism of the culture, that deliberately messing up a mission had consequences, and that they were making devil’s bargains with the male regiment and it would ultimately have bitten them in the butt if the campaign has continued<br/><br/> </div>

                            Ran a playtest of a new Goblinville adventure for seven ( <img alt=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/open_mouth.png" title=":open_mouth:"/> ) players.  It flowed surprisingly well.  Mostly new players, but impressive buy in to the concept and systems.  The spotlight-sharing was more or less seamless.  We adjusted the timeline of the game a bit (having to camp every two turns instead of four, etc) but this might not have even been necessary.  The biggest difference was that they could take on bigger threats than the best-equipped four goblin crew.<br/><br/>The moment to moment drama was consistently fun: diving off waterfalls, talking to confused ghosts, grumbling about haughty elves.  Again, the player buy-in drove this more than any moves on my part.                        </div>

                            I ran Dogs in the Vineyard last night, and a really interesting thing I'd never seen before happened. I'm running it for a group of rather OSR-oriented gamers, who've never played Dogs before.<br/><br/>In short:<br/><br/>1. One of the players took Traits that allow him to do subtle things which might appear vaguely demonic (like change the colour of his eyes).<br/><br/>2. In the initiations, I told them to include an NPC of the Town, if they wanted. (I had listed all the major NPCs in the Town on a piece of paper for them to consider for Relationships.)<br/><br/>3. For his initiation, this player wanted a scene with the Steward, where he convinced the Steward that he knew a lot about occult things and demonology.<br/><br/>4. Finally, we come to play the Town itself, and this Dog plays some tricks and launches a conflict to convince the Steward the <b>he (the Steward) is possessed by Demons</b>!<br/><br/>Pretty wild. Obviously, it worked, too, and it was in full public view, so now everyone in the Town (and the Steward himself) think their Steward is under demonic possession. The Dog is announcing recent marriages the Steward performed as invalid, and so on!<br/><br/>It's double interesting because of the Town prep I'd done for the Steward. I don't know if the players might read this, so I'd better leave this out, but it's incredible coincidence with what I had prepped: the way the Steward is going to interpret this possession in relation to his behaviour is going to be <i>super interesting</i>, and feels inevitable.<br/><br/>I'm now very excited to get back to this Town (we had to stop halfway through.)                        </div>

                            Just ran part 2 of "The Slayer Elite", NBA scenario in The Edom Files set in 1980. A lot of banter, and things didn't go off the rails until the last hour or so, at which point, I had enough solid groundwork that this was fine. It's all context -- this run is set in the mega-campaign of Dracula Dossier that I'm running, and it all makes Perfect Sense within that context.<br/><br/>Game quotes include:<br/><br/>Red: I don't know if poison's the normal KGB method.<br/>Vrach and Smiley, simultaneously: Are you kidding me?<br/><br/>Arabian (the pregen is dubbed "Horse", but the player decided the character preferred "Arabian") (brandishing his well thumbed copy of Dracula): Have you ever read this book?<br/>Red: Of course! It's Irish!<br/>Arabian: It's great!<br/>Red: It's terrible!<br/>Arabian: I have to spend a lot of time in parked cars --<br/>Red: So do I!<br/><br/>Red (to Arabian after he floats the idea that vampires might be real): Are you out of your Tiny. Gucci-clad. Mind.<br/><br/>Red: How are we going to kill the *^%&amp; British? Let's get back to the things I'm good at!<br/><br/>GM: So are you telling the [two extra pregens played as group NPCs] about the [REDACTED].<br/>Smiley (to the other PCs): Unless you want to split the money six ways, they don't know. Though to be fair, we may want to split the money six ways anyway.<br/><br/>There was also some discussion about their mission, given that the PCs were not Agents per se but rather assorted criminal or otherwise wanted people.<br/><br/>Smiley: I'm a thief, not an assassin!<br/>Red: I'm a bomber. I'm little bit of both.<br/><br/>And later:<br/><br/>Smiley: I'm a con artist, not a cold blooded murderer.<br/>Red: I'm a happy go lucky murderer. A Cole Porter murderer.<br/>Arabian: I'm a practical murderer.<br/>Smiley: I'm not a murderer at all.<br/>Vrach: It's not too late.<br/><br/> </div>

                            For Free RPG day, I ran demos of Mutants &amp; Masterminds and Feng Shui 2, as plus a full length (though still short) run of the Expanse quickstart. <br/><br/>It's the first time I've run the age system. It seems like the stunt system would be entertaining for the players, but doesn't amuse me as a GM. <br/><br/>One of.the players was in one of my regular groups and is super excited about the prospect of playing this regularly, but I think I'd rather run Scum &amp; Villainy.                         </div>

                            Little bit less gaming the last couple of weeks because you know <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redcarnations/red-carnations-on-a-black-grave" rel="nofollow">I have this little KS going on</a> but a quick summary of stuff:<br/><br/><b>Alas for the Awful Sea</b>: The Whaling Bark Tethys completed its fateful voyage; along the way, a bird-man sold his soul to the sea; the captain of the Charity went mad in the talons of the Old Gods; and the captain of the Tethys murdered the woman she loved and took the crew to the heart of the Dreamer's ancient drowned city, where she faced the indifference of the Old Gods and watched the Tethys founder on the cusp of escaping.<br/><br/><b>Sagas of the Icelanders</b>: The long awaited expedition to Vinland finally happened, wherein I learn once again that Vinland may just strain the game too much. Also, replaying the colonization of the New World is pretty demoralizing. (And a little gross.)<br/><br/><b>2097e</b>: I played a cockney warlock with debts owed to Dukes of Hell but a remit to help out the dogooding Emerald Enclave to stop the evil MacGuffin. Also, complimented a certain lich (in absentia) on their fabulous sense of dungeon furnishing style.<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b>: Got to play my Stonewall playset; I think I'm gonna spruce it up and maybe release it for Pride. I finally got to use the "Drag mother/drag daughter" relationship; my Billy was the daughter, super queeny even out of drag and broken up when Judy Garland died (because she was a Judy impersonator). Mommy was a St Teresa of Avila drag impersonator. Mayhem ensued. Nice turn from my friend who was playing a cop (and obviously the bad guy) who had to struggle with Billy's temptations.<br/><br/><b>Night's Black Agents</b>: Lisa said it better, but my Red knows she's in over her head, although <i>possibly</i> not beyond her ability to blow stuff up to get out of it.                        </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">Did you play it as it were a oneshot and your players adopt the enemies of their actual characters?</blockquote>
Um... I think the answer's no?<br/><br/>They're using the pregens that come with "Slayer Elite", and know zilch about the long, convoluted history we've built up over... I think we're in year 4?<br/><br/>For those characters, the pregens, it's a one shot that takes 3 sessions. For the players, including me, I think it's a weirdly refreshing break from all of the heavily convoluted R-map stuff I fall into at the drop of a spindle. Like, yes, I worked out the answers to a couple of questions that no longer matter, but that was stuff that might have mattered, and yes, I'm playing with convoluted R-maps, but that's for when we get to the present(ish) day, if we do.                        </div>

                            It's probably fine for a convention run so long as you frame aggressively and keep everyone focused on the missions. I find that at conventions, people tend to be more focused than in home games.                        </div>

                            Session 3 of the Kuf campaign. The Author's player was sick so the Nurse PC and my Cellist PC went on adventures alone.<br/><br/>The session started with the Nurse's prospective boyfriend showing up on the doorstep, with a horrible story about firefighters with axes cutting down one of his friends. And arson.<br/><br/>The PCs put him to bed to recover and left to investigate.  Found the fire station at the end of a desolate road deep in the woods.  It was patrolled by two firefighters in full kit, with chains and axes.  Sensing that something was wrong we escaped, and instead went and had coffee with the senile witch to learn more about the monsters that hide in the woods, and about <i>the marsh walk-ritual</i>.<br/><br/>We ended the session with the PCs performing the ritual late at night in the woods where they encountered a magical creature, somewhat woman-like with red braids.  They slept with her in exchange for magical items.<br/><br/>So now we have a necklace made of teeth and a small blue cow with silver bells on its horns.  Exactly what these items do is still unknown, research is ongoing.                           </div>

                            I've been playing a lot of Monster of the Week lately, but this week I got to try The Wizards Grimoire and Psi*Run. They were both new to me and both ended up being a really great time.<br/><br/>I played The Wizards Grimoire with two friends who play with pretty regularly, but always as GM. So they wanted me to play the Wizard to change things up. I really dug the way the game changed up the typical GM-player structure, and I could totally imagine hacking other games to run that way. For the volunteers it was their first time in a GM type role and they really took to it (although they had to tell me to pipe down a few times at the beginning)! I think it helps that they have great chemistry together as players. The only snag was that they were a bit worried about blocking me at some points since I was the only player, and it can be a little tricky finding a mixed success in the exertion mechanics. I particularly love the list of spawning circumstances and I picked "Tell your volunteers that you've been seeking out an astrologer-hermit to help you unravel certain confusions you suffer, in the wilderness outside the city. You've been unable to find them. Now night is hard upon you, you've been cornered by a raiding party of the city's enemies." What an exciting way to start the game!<br/><br/>IPsi*Run I  GM'd as a one shot at our local RPG Meetup and that was possibly even more fun. First of all the premise about having super powers but no memories and being on the run from a mysterious organization is just so perfect for a one shot. How could that not be exciting? The best part of the game for me though was definitely the questions that the players created at the beginning of the game and the fact that I as the GM played almost no role in answering them. It allowed for a twist ending that I had no idea was coming; I don't think that's ever really happened for me in a game where I was the GM before.                        </div>
