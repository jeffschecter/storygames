I love having players explore a setting that I've created and I love the challenge of molding a plot based on my players' preferences and their characters' interests, and then adapting it on the fly to whatever happens.  It's a neat exercise, and when the players are having a good time I really get a charge out of it.<br/><br/>The trouble is that that level of story-responsibility is not sustainable for a full campaign.  It's really exhausting to be be the one who's driving the entertainment for a full evening.  This was really driven home to me when I burned out of my last weekly strong-GM campaign -- within four sessions it felt more like a chore than a joy.<br/><br/>So I had a lot of incentive to change up my approach.  Luckily, I'm blessed with a ready bunch of experimental subjects.  <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/SeattleGAMERS_ASSEMBLE/" rel="nofollow">Seattle Gamers Assemble</a> has a <a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Weekly_Short-Shots" rel="nofollow">Monday night event</a> at a local gaming clubhouse where the focus is on <a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Weekly_Short-Shots#Indie.2C_Oldie.2C_Oddball" rel="nofollow">indie, oldie, and oddball games.</a> <br/><br/>I pitched my experimental game to SGA as a "Lazy Gamemaster" event, to make it clear that I didn't want primary story responsibility.  I would come up with the setting / premise design method and choose the game system, and then afterwards I would be a bass player and audience. <br/><br/>People were enthusiastic, the game was adopted and scheduled, and we came up with EXODUS-II -- "Humanity's last hope... or its last battleground."  <br/><br/><a href="http://johnaegard.livejournal.com/25222.html#cutid1" rel="nofollow">I've got an AP on my blog.</a> Originally I wrote it for posting here, but it's way too long for that -- I don't want to blow out Andy's mysql!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
