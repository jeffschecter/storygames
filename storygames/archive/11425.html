I have started another thread that sorta outlined my game, but I wanted to start a new one to get some fresh feedback. The previous thread can be found <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11334" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to know what you think of my current Frankenstein creation, as well as ask if anyone would like to help me to make it more streamlined and shorter, without making it hard to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my latest iteration of the rules. I have not had a chance to playtest them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Resolving Conflicts</b><br/>\nWhenever people have conflicting interests in the outcome of an action a <b>Conflict</b> can be called. When this happens, determine the <b>Stakes</b> of the conflict. The stakes are what the conflict is meant to resolve. Then, <b>Frame the Scene</b>, or determine the elements of the scene that set the stage for the conflict, including adding any <b>Scene Aspects </b>that are appropriate. This can be done by the GM or by consensus.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the scene has been set, roll 2d6. These dice make up your <b>Conflict Pool</b>. Then take turns <b>Raising</b>. A Raise Narration is any narrated action that your opponent cannot ignore. You bid 2 of your Conflict Pool dice whenever you Narrate a Raise and remove them from your conflict pool. Whoever opens the conflict Narrates the first Raise. Take turns Narrating Raises. Each player should get one turn to Raise during each round. You can roll dice to determine initiative, take turns in the order of the highest Conflict Pool die result, or just go around the table taking turns.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a player Narrates a Raise, everyone who is affected by the Raise has to Narrate a <b>See</b>. Narrating a See means you narrate an action that is a response to a Raise. You must equal or exceed the total of the 2 Raise dice to See a Raise. If you Narrate a See with only one die, that is a <b>Reversal</b>. Keep that die for your next Raise. If you Narrate a See with two dice, that is either a <b>Block</b> or a <b>Dodge</b>. If you Narrate a See with three or more dice, that is <b>Taking It</b>. Remove all See dice besides a Reversal from your Conflict Pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you Take It, you get an appropriate <b>Condition Aspect</b> with a value of 2d6. This Condition Aspect remains until appropriate conditions in the Narrative remove the Condition.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny time you Raise or See and you have an <b>Untagged Aspect</b> that could positively affect the Raise or See, you may <b>Tag</b> that Aspect and roll its dice. Add them to your Conflict Pool. You may Tag any number of appropriate Untagged Aspects for each Raise or See.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you Narrate <b>Assisting</b> someone, give them a die from your Conflict Pool. You may only Narrate a Raise with one die during your next turn to Narrate a Raise. You may Assist someone at any time it would make sense in the Narrative. <b>Relationship</b> dice do not count when determining the number of dice in a Raise or if a See is a Reversal, Block, Dodge, or Taking It.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever someone cannot See a Raise, or else when someone decides that they want to Narrate a <b>Fold</b> instead of See, that person is out of the conflict, and none of their further actions affect the outcome or progression of the Conflict or demand a See. If you decide to Narrate a Fold when it is your turn to Raise or See, add 1 to your <b>Fate pool</b>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last person with dice in their Conflict Pool gets to Narrate the results with regard to what is at stake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Aspects</b><br/>\nAn Aspect is basically an item, condition, description, or situation that you have highlighted in the Narrative that has Mechanics attached to it. When appropriately Narrated, an Aspect can be Tagged to produce the following effects:<br/>\n1)\tAdd the Aspect dice to your Conflict Pool if you Narrate it as an advantage<br/>\n2)\tNarrate a fact related to the Aspect into play (including possibly adding an Aspect to the Scene, items, or characters)<br/>\nWhen not otherwise defined, Aspects have dice equal to 2d6. Tagged Aspects cannot be utilized until they have been Untagged.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Relationships</b><br/>\nWhen your character is involved in a Conflict that also involves another PC, you may add the Relationship dice for that PC into your Conflict Pool. If you have added the Relationship dice of another PC to your Conflict Pool, you have the right to deny that PC from adding your character\u2019s Relationship dice to their Conflict Pool. When you add Relationship dice to your Conflict Pool, the Relationship is weakened by one dice step.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Keys</b><br/>\nWhen you hit a Key, you can do one of three things:<br/>\n1)\tTake an experience point (<b>XP</b>)<br/>\n2)\tAdd a point to your Fate pool (up to a max of 10)<br/>\n3)\tIf you go into danger because of your Key, you get 2 XP or 2 Fate points<br/>\n(or 1 XP and 1 Fate point).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have accumulated 5 XP, you earn an <b>Advance</b>. You can spend an Advance on one of the following:<br/>\n1)\tAdd a new Aspect at 2d4 (based on something you learned during play or on some past experience that has come to light)<br/>\n2)\tUpgrade an Aspect by 1 die size.<br/>\n3)\tAdd a new Key (you can never have the same key twice)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can hold on to Advances if you want, and spend them at any time, even in the middle of a Conflict!<br/>\n<br/>\nEach Key also has a <b>Buyoff</b>. If the Buyoff condition occurs, you have the<br/>\noption of removing the Key and earning two Advances.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fate Pool</b><br/>\nYour Fate Pool starts play at 3. You can spend a Fate point from your pool to do any one of the following things:<br/>\n1)\tAdd 1d6 to your Conflict Pool<br/>\n2)\tUntag an Aspect<br/>\n3)\tUtilize an Aspect known to you that is not on your character sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Refresh</b><br/>\nAt any time during play that there is not a Conflict going on, a player may initiate a <b>Refresh Scene</b>. The Refresh Scene must be narratively appropriate, and must involve at least one other PC. The subject of this scene can be any sort of character building exposition, including but not limited to a flashback, a dream sequence, a debriefing, a foreshadowing, or any other character building narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the conclusion of a Refresh Scene, the following effects take place for each character involved in the scene:<br/>\n1)\tAll of the Aspects of the involved characters become Untagged.<br/>\n2)\tThe Fate Pool of every character involved is set to 1 or their current Fate Pool amount, whichever is higher.<br/>\n3)\tConditions can be removed if they have been appropriately narrated as removed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of any Refresh Scene, all of the players have the option to secretly adjust any Relationship dice that they want. Relationship dice can be adjusted in 2 ways:<br/>\n1)\tIncreased by one dice step.<br/>\n2)\tDecreased by any number of dice steps.<br/>\nWhen all the players have had a chance to adjust any Relationship dice they desire, the players then reveal the changes they have made to the affected characters. Whenever any Relationship dice have been adjusted, no one may adjust any relationship dice until after the next Conflict.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254388/#Comment_254388" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T21:17:05+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  9:17PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, you might want to repost (for more eyes on design) over on Praxis up there.
