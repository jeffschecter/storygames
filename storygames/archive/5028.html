I played through Silent Hill 3 a number of times to pick up all the available player costumes. And so on. I dunno, I'm a visual guy.<br/><br/>Likewise, I like to think about what my character is wearing, be it a fantasy Europe game or a modern asian crime-drama. Boots or sneakers? plain or decorative scabbard? What do they say about the character? Not a huge thing that I dwell on (like, not enough to make a focused RPG which strives to answer the question, "How Do the Clothes Make the Man?"), but still I love fashion/gear details far more than other random scenery.<br/><br/>What is a clothing or accessory feature that your one of your recent characters sported?<br/><br/>For me, my Ice Elf in D&amp;D (2nd level, 1 thief 1 spirit shaman) wears thick, long seal-hide mukluks, light trousers, and a huge coat, like a heavily padded <a href="http://www.cryoflesh.com/images/Verticulon%20Coat%20Redone.jpg" rel="nofollow">ventriculon long coat</a>.

I never quite communicated why that was so awesome, but for me, every time he pulled those weapons I was engaged and on fire for the game.<br/><br/>And of course, our Matrix universe characters were <i>all about</i> their clothes and sunglasses.

It was awesome.<br/><br/>SHAMELESS SELF PROMOTION SECTION: I'm working on a game design right now that uses a set of pre-gen characters (about 30) that each have three "stages" from novice to master. Each stage gets its own character sheet, and when you advance to the next stage, you switch to a new character sheet with a cooler costume and gear. Like, you "unlock" your armored great coat, longbore steam pistol, and scary magical eye patch and there they are on your new stage 2 sheet.<br/><br/>The various ships in the game get the same treatment, so you can upgrade them to their more bad-ass configurations as you play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113348/#Comment_113348" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T12:15:32+00:00" title="December 10, 2007 12:15PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Tell us a story about your pants!</blockquote>\nOK!<br/><br/>I ran this sprawling electro-punk game set in the rubble of the second Martian invasion, ca. 1911.  Martian "blood parasites" were infecting people and taking over their brains - they dominated a gang of Irish thugs in New York's Houston street ruins called the Patsy Conroys, real high-toned dudes in the true sense of the word "dude".  It was easy to tell when someone had a blood parasite - the Martian Overmind didn't understand human personal hygiene, so their thralls would do evil stuff until their bladders burst and they'd messed their plaid gangster trousers.

If you asked me what I wore, I would have probably said "Uh, elf-y fantasy stuff."  That character died within the first five minutes of play, so after the others had a quick battle I came him with my second, identical-stats-to-my-first-guy character.  This time, I described myself a bit more, as I was channeling an evil elven Shaft.  I can't remember what I said at this point, but I do remember dying within five minutes of playing evil elf Shaft because another PC didn't like something I said.<br/><br/>So, uh, very soon after that, my <em>third</em> character of the night, with the exact same stats so I could get to playing right away, came in contact with the PC group and talked his way out of being killed.  Now, in particular I remember saying that this version of my character had a purple coat, a wide-brimmed hat and "goldfish platform sandals."  I fought over those sandals when others balked at it.  Looking back now, I guess they probably represented my, uh, feeling of "noob-sploitation."  I dunno.  Goldfish platform sandals are metal.<br/><br/>Yeah, so, with every death my clothing became more and more defined, and more and more outlandish.  Now, around ten years later, I <em>remember</em> what that third character wore.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Tell us a story about your pants!</blockquote>\nDamnit, I'm off-topic.  I, uh, don't remember what sort of pants Evil Elf <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> wore, but in my mind's eye I now imagine them to be shiny, purple &amp; very gaudy.

As part of the revelation, Cass'ul said "I won't be needing these anymore," and tossed his trademark leather bomber jacket and wallet with Earth ID to my character, Claire Tremont. So I dutifully wrote down on my sheet, "Earthly possessions of Rufus Castle: bomber jacket, wallet with ID". And for the rest of the series, Claire was wearing Castle/Cass'ul's bomber jacket, which everyone else kind of forgot about.<br/><br/>In the last session of that series, Brandon decided the time had come to buy off another Key and renounce his newly-remade allegiance to the Wave Mistress of Mars, in order to have the XP to do some other cool thing. Just as Cass'ul was making some speech of defiance or some such thing, Claire said "Cass'ul! Here!", and tossed him the bomber jacket (with wallet and Earth ID inside). <br/><br/>There was also a whole thing about wearing masks, but I hope Brandon will drop in and write about that himself (and fill in other details I may have forgotten about how he got the jacket back at the end).<br/><br/>And speaking of Claire, in her original story <a href="http://attacksofopportunity.wetpaint.com/page/The+Man+from+Zanzibar" rel="nofollow">Pulp Heroes Season 1: "The Man from Zanzibar"</a>, she eventually gained the armband of Ankhnaten, a mysterious yet supposedly powerful mystical item. She's worn it ever since as a symbol of her allegiance to the forces of light and heir to the power of Ankhnaten. Its powers have been redefined in every game, but almost never actually used; it's much more important as a fashion accessory that symbolizes who and what she is than it is as an item of equipment. In the most recent Tales from the Aether, "Khai-Shira-Kai and the Oblivion Equation", which featured an "evil" duplicate of Claire, possession of the armband became a running plot element and it was hotly contested. I eventually took the Artifact stunt (we were using SotC for this series) just to make sure the armband couldn't be permanently taken from the real Claire.<br/><br/>I've generally made sure to describe the look of my characters, but I think Claire is the only one to really have a piece of clothing or gear that developed real significance.<br/><br/>Edit: come to think of it, Claire really should've adopted the leather bomber jacket look for herself after "The Thought Lords of Mars". It'd also be appropriate considering her long association with Nick Timber.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113362/#Comment_113362" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T13:29:31+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  1:29PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite>Some months ago, on a Polish forum, we've been discussing an idea for a pop fantasy game in which the characters would be mechanically defined entirely by their clothing.

The two characters that come to mind immediately were characters I made for Shadowrun. One was a PC I never got to play except as a GMPC.. I mean, NPC. The other was meant to be an NPC from the beginning, and while she became prominent in every game I included her in, she never stole the spotlight, 'cause it wasn't her style. People just liked her, so she became more important than the support NPC she was designed to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first: Thanatos. (yes, yes. Groan and get it over with. Keep going, once I describe the outfit, you'll wish you groaned more up front)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanatos wore either a black or blood red cloak with cowl (fine clothing), his helmet and body armor was black with silver highlights that more than suggested the human skeletal structure. He carried a switchblade scythe (dikoted, of course) and chanted latin while he fought. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe second, more successful NPC was Silver. She was an elven decker, and was really, really into silver. Her hair was artificial, in flowing silver. Her cybereyes were natural looking, except for the silver irises. (not the full silver eyes; That's creepy, and Silver was *never* creepy) Her nails were done in silver (and occasionally if push came to shove, her retractible hand razors would come into play). It wasn't uncommon for her shirts to be in a silvery grey (not metallic, though. That'd be tacky, and Silver was never tacky.)

My schoolgirl Yomi has made it through a few different games before dying in Classroom Deathmatch (nail gun to the back of the head while waist deep in wet cement). In Panty Explosion she wore a custom uniform which included wool stockings, mittens and a cat-eared hood (this was the winter uniform for our Hokkaido school). After moving to Tokyo after graduation (for a Shooting the Moon game) she was keen on a knee length wool coat with heavy brass buttons, mens dress shirts and a dashing fedora. After taking a job as a secretary (for Best Friends) she complimented the standard office lady uniform with a small silver kokopelli pin and white gloves 9to hide the scars from Shooting the Moon).Some time after this she reverted back to a teenager and returned to high school just in time to be drafted into Classroom Deathmatch, where she spent most of the contest running around in her gym shorts.<br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113446/#Comment_113446" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T01:44:53+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  1:44AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clearly, Jake, the way animals dress in SEA DRACULA is very important.
