That's why I clumsily appended 'massively' to the phrase, to help distinguish between <i>D&amp;D</i> and <i>Polaris</i> in the way that 'MMO' distinguishes games like <i>World of Warcraft</i> from other multiplayer games like <i>Overwatch</i>.<br/><br/>Also very excited to read through <i>Coyotes of Chicago</i>! From the quick glance I gave it, it definitely seems like it fits the bill. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> I certainly agree that these games fall under the larger umbrella of 'GMless' games, but think that, in a few particular cases (e.g. <i>Polaris</i> and <i>Dream Askew</i>), player responsibilities <i>can be(come)</i> so radically asymmetrical, that a different taxonomy could be devised and applied.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460149/#Comment_460149" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-11T22:38:39+00:00" title="February 11, 2017 10:38PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very well!

She swears this setup plays out great.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We tried a Governor/Sympathy split once, but without much success. I'd also love to hear how Rafu's fiancee does it.</blockquote>\nHere I am, at last. So, her recipe for 3-player <i>Mars Colony</i> is: one player is the Governor of Opposition scenes, one is the Governor of Personal scenes and one is the Savior. They all take turns framing scenes of their type, in a regular round-robin fashion: one Governor goes, then the other and then the Savior. The Savior player still has the option of choosing whether to frame a Personal or a Progress scene - for a convention environment or other time-limit context, though, it's recommended the Savior chooses a Progress scene at every opportunity - while having a  Governor in charge of that ensures there's still plenty of Personal scenes in a game nonetheless.<br/><br/>In practice, the line between Personal and Opposition can easily become blurred - that's OK. In regular 2-player play it's obviously a non-issue, since both scene types are governed by the same rules. In this variant it may look like an issue, because different individuals should be framing the scene in each case... Just don't sweat it: start each scene as legit and appropriate to its kind, but then, just allow it morph into whatever kind of scene it happens to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
