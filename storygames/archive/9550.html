One player spoke, while the others spoke out the interior thoughts of the speaking character, going from one emotion to another. <br/><br/>At Camp Nerdly we played <a href="http://gnavpotveksler.wikidot.com/projects:butter-forger" rel="nofollow">The Butterforger</a> with about a dozen players. The players not in the scene played the audience for the trial in the game world, and they were much like a chorus. Calling for meatballs and death for the defendant at various times (though they declared him innocent at the end, since they functioned as a jury too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211919/#Comment_211919" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T08:46:43+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  8:46AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was also a bar in Oslo that holds an interactive theater piece every Wednesday.

In my Swords &amp; Wizardry game that I am running on Twitter, the players hired a local teenager as a torchbearer. I've been using her reactions to highlight the genuine creepiness of wandering around in dank tunnels with things natural and unnatural trying to kill you. After all when a severed head starts talking this is not something most people would be blas\xe9 about.<br/><br/>This has allowed me to put some emotional resonance into scenes without resorting to the rudeness of putting words or feelings into the mouths or heads of the PCs. It occured to me that Tara the torchmaiden was playing the part of a chorus, and I have started pondering how I might use this technique in other games. So I'm excited to hear about other people's experiences with the idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar" title="salvagebar"><img alt="salvagebar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar">salvagebar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211988/#Comment_211988" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T12:37:35+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 12:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I run a Monday night <i>Necessary Evil</i> game. The theme of the setting is a global uprising, so I ripped a page out of <i>Grey Ranks</i> (thank you JaMo), and produce a short Radio Lightning broadcast and distribute it before each session. It functions like a chorus, in that I mean to use it to hold a mirror up to the campaign and the PC's actions. The players seem to enjoy the hell out of them.<br/><br/>Also, they are fun and easy to make - I aim for a length of about a minute.<br/><br/>Here are the first two:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/miluuv00my" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.box.net/shared/miluuv00my</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/ditp8nr89e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.box.net/shared/ditp8nr89e</a><br/><br/>I like the idea of using a character who is in the story and has personal contact with the PC's, like the torchbearing teenager. This seems like a purer use of the chorus concept. I take it that the idea is to use the unfortunate lass to reflect how normal men and women would look at the actions of a typical PC. Insert the personal horror you would feel at watching a group of people fight toe-to-toe with clubs and daggers, and then pluck weapons and valuables from the corpses of the dead.<br/><br/>There was a framing concept game that was published a few years back, with the idea that the real campaign action was the delusions of a mental patient, and sessions of the 'actual' game would be framed with therapy sessions discussing the character's actions (i.e. "I staked my sister when she became a vampire!" "Stay calm, Mr. Tevis. Let's explore this...").<br/><br/>Does this count as 'chorus'? And does anyone have personal experience using this game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212035/#Comment_212035" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T16:14:56+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  4:14PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Sal, the psych-patient approach sounds like a pretty tight, specific medium, but it could contain some really cool 1:1 player/GM opportunities! I wonder if the GM's input could come in the form of "now, that doesn't make any sense" and other, Drama-based nudges to re-establish credibility. Neat!<br/><br/>For that matter: it sounds, absolutely, like your use of Radio Lightning is functioning as a Chorus - an entity that provides context for the audience. That's what I would consider the role of a Chorus, at any rate, and if the actors are also the audience, this fits the role nicely! <br/><br/>On a tangentially-related note, I've decided to call the GM the "Chorus" in a new Story Now game of mine, set in mythical Greece: <i>The Hellenes</i>. I like the implication that the GM's job is to portray a lot of different people, and since the Chorus is a group (I think), this seemed to fit the setting pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212051/#Comment_212051" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T18:30:37+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  6:30PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Salvagebar, you may be thinking of "Power Kill" by John Tynes (can be found on his website).<br/><br/>So far I've been using Tara the torchmaiden not so much to comment on the behavior of the PCs, but to provide a "fresh eyes" reaction to the creepy strangeness of the dungeon itself.

Steve, do you have any material written up for this Camberwick Green thing?Whisper me your contact details and I'll send it over. It is rather dependent on knowledge of British 70s TV shows for full enjoyment but we had an Aussie play once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar" title="salvagebar"><img alt="salvagebar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar">salvagebar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212108/#Comment_212108" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-13T08:36:44+00:00" title="June 13, 2009  8:36AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2009 9:00AM by salvagebar.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            rafial:<br/>I absolutely was talking about "Power Kill". I don't know how valid some of John Tunes' concerns are, but it is worth reading.<br/><br/><i>"Here is a box, a musical box, wound up and ready to play. But this box can hide a secret inside.

There are no riots in Camberwick Green, where the evil is more sinister and internal. Here's a three-minute chunk of the whole session - to get the complete audio you need to become a patron.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/2sl9km4hs5" rel="nofollow">Trumpton Riots sample</a><br/><br/>They had seven players, six for the Fire Brigade, and the odd man had to play the cat. But he had nine lives, which put him ahead of the majority of CoC characters.<br/><br/>Stop-motion marionettes are superhumanly creepy. It would not surprise me to learn that Camberwick Green is overrun with Deep Ones using them to fulfill their breeding mandate. Good riddens to the lot of the awkward bastards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212133/#Comment_212133" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-13T12:52:36+00:00" title="June 13, 2009 12:52PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's my scenario they're playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
