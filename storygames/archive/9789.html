It was an online game, so we managed to do this over the course of a couple days on a wiki, but I don't see why it wouldn't work at a table. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe technique worked best when we started interlacing our supporting characters. One character's friend was another character's contact and a third character's enemy. Sometimes, our PCs were, themselves, friends or contacts (though generally not). We had our pretense for being together in a group, but the background characters were only tangentially related. It would have really sung once we'd taken an interlude in the dungeon-crawl and headed back to civilization, but unfortunately, scheduling problems killed the game before we'd played 5 sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217751/#Comment_217751" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-11T00:04:02+00:00" title="July 11, 2009 12:04AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2009 7:03AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edited to reflect that fact I posted last night and missed the focus of the thread: to establish relationships between the PCs...]<br/><br/>From two games I've played where this worked well.<br/><br/><br/>In my view, <b>HeroQuest</b> in <b>Glorantha</b> is all about relationships.  The world is a rich matrix of loyalties to family, faith, culture and friendships.  <br/><br/>Mechanically, all Attributes are a blank slate with a score attached: You can have a Sword 17, but you can also have, Loves Wife 17.  And so on.  In a fantastic oneshot I GM'd at a convention, one Player had an Ashamed of Son 13.  (The son in question was another Player Character.)  Another Player wrote down Hates Father 13.  In this case, the father and his two sons, all played by the games three Players, where tied to each other.  The father, a widower, as also courting an NPC, and the two sons were conflicted about her.  She was a secret worshiper of the Red Goddes, the enemy god of the father and the sons, and one of the sons had found out about this.  The PCs had scores for their devotions to different aspects of their god, Orlanth, which came into play when these conflicts came to the fore.<br/><br/>So, the setting is all about mixing and matching loyalties and conflicts out of the gate.  You can mechanically tag the Attributes with numeric values so they come into play and keep them as firing pistons in play.  When stress comes via the GM's input, these relationships are drawn on for strength, or are tested, or even change.<br/><br/>Also, I stole Kickers from <i>Sorcerer</i> and each Player tied their Kicker to the woman the father PC was courting.  Since they all had a tight, emotional stake in this relationship between the father PC and the woman, it again reinforced the relationships between them.<br/><br/>(Also, there's lots of work to be done with Community Resources via the rules.  I would really check out Chris Chinn's notes on his <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Deeper in the Game</a> blog.)<br/><br/><br/><b>Sorcerer</b> starts the Player Characters with a relationship with a Demon.  Right off the bat. The every Players' Character starts with a strong relationship with an NPC.  (And all Demons should be played as NPCs, not as tools for the Sorcerer to use.)<br/><br/>But, significantly (and often forgotten) the grid on the back of the character sheet should be chock full of NPCs as well.  Having a rich tapestry of human relationships is vital to make the game work.  As the rules say, "Sorcery and demonics are just fantasy; real pain and triumph reside in the real human heart.  Stories are about people, and there should be lots of people in the game-world with names, problems, and interlocking lives, many of which present problems for the players."<br/><br/>The notion that "<i>Sorcerer</i> is <i>about</i> dysfunctional relationships" is incorrect.  <i>Sorcerer</i> is about relationships, period. <br/><br/>Specifically it is about how people treat each other in these relationshps.  This is what the Humanity mechanic is about.  So, while a sorcerer's relationship <i>with a Demon</i> is a dysfunctional relationship, there need to be lots of other healthy relationships that are threatened by the dysfunctional relationship and stand in contrast to it.  It's no different than the kids in THE WIRE having a dysfunctional relationship with Stringer Bell or the Ring of Power in the THE LORD OF THE RINGS allowing Frodo to escape discovery from his enemies even as it threatens his friendships with the people he cares about most.<br/><br/>When I GM Sorcerer I try to get <i>any</i> and <i>all</i> NPCs the Players mention during character creation on the grid on the character sheet.  I might not get to them all.  But for a <i>Sorcerer</i> GM this is the stuff of the game -- the relationships that the PC cares about, values, and might even have summoned a demon to save.  Although they aren't tagged with numerical scores as in <i>HeroQuest</i>, they are as much a part of the game's mechanics once they are written down.<br/><br/>Now, in most <i>Sorcerer</i> games the PCs might or might not know each other.  But last year I ran a game of Sorcerer in which the connection between the PCs was very important.<br/><br/>It was set in a slightly hacked version of the <i>Traveller</i> universe.  The PCs were going to be in charge of a merc company, having mustered out of military service together (a standard set-up for <i>Traveller</i> games).  Humanity was <i>Friendship</i>.  I laid out a timeline of the military history along the edge of the Imperium in the subsectors that would be our setting: "This world fell in this year, the Imperium rallied here," and so on.  The Players then chose points of history and location for their PCs, and the history of when they met and fought together -- the highs and lows of a campaign along the edges of the Spinward Marches.<br/><br/>The grid on a <i>Sorcerer</i> character sheet is divided into four quadrants: Lore, Past, Price and Kicker.  The idea is to write down names of people, places and things in the grid that fit under one of the quadrants.  Each of the PCs ended up with the name of the ship their company owned, the name of the unit they served in, and the name of the world where they betrayed their allies under orders from the Imperium, and the name of the world where they were told to retreat but rallied the locals and ended up turning the tide of the war.  What each one of these things meant to each PC differed a little in emphasis, so some ended up under Past, some ended up under Kicker or Price.<br/><br/>This meant that these significant moments were right there on the character sheet -- not only as references to history but as their ties to each other.  Because a <i>Sorcerer</i> GM uses the grid as a springboard for new conflicts, bangs and relationships of value, I had a font of material to work with just from these few items.  (There were many items on the grid specific to each PC as well.)  NPCs who had either been allies or enemies returned from the past for the story we were playing out -- and everyone had a shared response (with different shading) to the arrival of these characters.  Old wounds from victories and losses of the past got opened in new ways as they had to examine in new light each other's behaviors under new stress.  Since the locations and people were specifically tied to the game's mechanics (Kickers, Past, Price and Lore) they never floated away under "just backstory" but were a vital part of how the game played out in the present.<br/><br/>Finally, each Player created a Kicker that referenced or involved the merc company and the job they had been hired to do.  Since they were friends and depended on each other, this bound them together in the present tense of the game as well.  How they handled the job meant a lot to each PC in different ways.<br/><br/>The shared history as part of character creation, and then having some way of marking it as a vital part of game play worked out really, really well for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217758/#Comment_217758" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-11T02:04:18+00:00" title="July 11, 2009  2:04AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Hickey</cite>Then I thought about saying a rumour you've heard about the character to your left.</blockquote>That's exactly what we did when I ran UA a few years back.

Your character hates the character of the player to your left and<br/>2.  Your character loves the character of the player to your right.<br/><br/>Loving someone who hates you, and vice versa, is a pretty simple and effective way to kick-start over-the-top relationships.<br/><br/>In Graham Walmsley's game A Taste for Murder, you create mutual relationships as part of character generation.  They are invariably things like "He used to beat me as a child".<br/><br/>In Fiasco you choose relationships as part of setup, like "Work:  Supervisor and Employee", with the players on your left and right, and create a sort of R-Map that defines the starting situation.  You don't even know who your character is until the relationships are locked down.<br/><br/>Keys in TSOY absolutely work best when they are pointed at other player's characters, doubly so if they are mutual.<br/><br/>In Grey Ranks the first chapter (out of ten) is risk free - you automatically succeed, but frame mission and personal scenes for your character and your Crew.

What techniques and rules did they use?</b></blockquote>\nIn Mythender, people tend to create characters that are fiercely strong-willing and have very opposing goals. This presented a number of problems, and games use to have that "so, why the hell are we bothering to journey together?" weirdness.<br/><br/>As characters are almost done, I start by offering five adjectives, which each person not getting to pick the same one: fastest, fiercest, deadliest, luckiest, most wrathful. While that doesn't set up relationships, it seems to get people in a mindset to start comparing characters and jockeying for different roles in the story. (It also has another impact on the game, but that's not important for this.)<br/><br/>Then they answer "Why I'm traveling with [Person]" for every other character, and those characters answer why they are with them. Each pair comes up with this reason together, but it needn't be a mutual thing. One person could say to another "I'm traveling with you because I am entranced by your beauty," with the other responding with "I'm traveling with you because I'm certain you'll fail and will become a Myth, and I want it to be me who ends you when you do." (Which happened in a con game.) Naturally, both sides should agree that they want such a relationship in the story, so you can reject something you don't want to see. (There's also a game impact to your choice, but again, not important here.)<br/><br/>All said, I've stopped doing the second part at cons, because it takes too long in a four-hour slot with character creation. So I just start with "So, can you guys buy into traveling together for the purposes of this con game?" It doesn't create the richness I get out of the campaign, but then what one-shot does?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217838/#Comment_217838" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-12T02:58:05+00:00" title="July 12, 2009  2:58AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone, this is excellent stuff.<br/><br/>Wolfe, I really like that 'interlacing your NPCs' idea. <br/>Ryan, that "Why are you travelling with this person?" question is gold.<br/><br/>James, the idea of choosing two rumours about yourself to be true seems like it'd work really well. How did the players respond to it?<br/><br/>Chris, thanks for drawing out your experiences with Heroquest and Sorceror (I followed your APs for both games). What I really liked about your HQ example wasn't just that characters had traits that defined their relationships with each other, but that they had traits in common (like about Orlanth) that would also put them into conflicts and alliances with each other (depending on what they believed about a particular conflict or situation).<br/><br/>Jason, I'll have to get Malcolm Craig to lend me Grey Ranks so I can check out what you're talking about.<br/><br/>Tom, exactly!

The group collaboratively creates X number or more of potential 'hosts', all of them tied to the situation, or to people who are tied to the situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nA brief example: The situation is that a train is derailed. Valid characters might be the train conductor, a passenger on the train, or the police investigator who has to try to figure out what happened. Other valid characters would be the train conductor's teenaged son, the passenger's business associate who is waiting for him to arrive, or the investigator's wife. Once the minimum requirement of X hosts has been satisfied, the players select which host interests them most, which may or may not be one of the ones they came up with. An interesting twist is that the situation that centered the web *hasn't happened yet*.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other game, Rats in the Walls, may also have something to add to this discussion. When you create your character, they are made with a number of hatreds (persons, places, things, practices, beliefs, etc. which they hate deeply). Once the hatreds are created, you have to start drawing lines between them. Each hatred must connect to at least two other hatreds, one of which cannot be one of your own. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother brief example: I hate terrorists, explosions, and politicians. You hate violence, privilege and Mayor Tom. Mayor Tom is a politician, so he connects there. He's also rich as dark chocolate, so he connects to privilege. Terrorists and explosions both connect to Violence, and they connect to each other, so those are satisfied. We can say that politicians are also privileged, so that's the minimum of two connections each, with the minimum of 1 connection each to another player's hatred. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce play starts, you address and affect hatreds, which pulls on the strings of other hatreds, meaning that your actions will affect other players indirectly. (or even directly)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217863/#Comment_217863" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-12T11:11:54+00:00" title="July 12, 2009 11:11AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Hickey</cite>Can you tell me about games you've played/read/written that encourage players to establish pre-game relationships between their characters.

At the start of a session you get a Strength 1 (2 of you only have two players) connection to each of the other PCs, and for each connection you need to write down its "Contents", which is what kind of bond you have to that character (Friend, Rival, Love, Respect, etc.). Over the course of the game, whenever a new character shows up you can make an "Impression Check" to create a connection from them to you, and they can do the same. Between scenes you can spend Dreams (points, kind of like Fan Mail in how they're awarded, but there's no hard limit to how many you can give out) to strengthen your connections to others, and you can change contents if you think it appropriate. It works nicely in play, and it doesn't hurt that having connections gives PCs the resources (points of Wonder and Feelings) they need to get things done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217908/#Comment_217908" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-12T19:34:15+00:00" title="July 12, 2009  7:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always stop the game after 2-3 sessions and ask the following:<br/><br/>"How do you want your character to interact with the other characters?

Players then create relationships to each other and NPC's (selecting a named one or creating something from any general type), with requirement at least one each must be to/shared with another PC (and must be different PC's).<br/><br/>So story map has, for example, goblins and religious strong men, and corruption.  Leads easily to things like:<br/><br/>- One character survived a massacre by goblin tribes who have a mysterious leader making them particularly effective, another character's elven tribe is threatened by expansion of those same goblins and has worked as scout for human realm fighting them.<br/>- One character is a cleric whose faith is being persecuted by a firebrand troublemaker rising star in another faith, another character is a younger PC who barely escaped falling prey the perverted appetite of said firebrand (but can't prove anything about it)<br/>etc.<br/><br/>That process pretty much created the starring NPC villains, threats, plots for the entire campaign.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218029/#Comment_218029" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T11:10:23+00:00" title="July 13, 2009 11:10AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobilis requires you to make up Anchors (important NPC tools) as part of chargen, and the PC has to either love or hate them.<br/><br/>A game I was in online that never got started used something like this, where out of the 5 PC's, you had to explain why you loved one and hated another.  At first I resisted this idea, but after everybody weighed in, it made the interconnections much more fraught and interesting, especially since we were all making our characters out in the open.  So I knew that character X was simply taking a friendly interest in helping my character, but my character hated him because she thought he was setting her up to be sexually harassed.  Of course, then the game imploded on the launch pad so I never got to see how it would work in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218623/#Comment_218623" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T21:06:25+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  9:06PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Hickey</cite>James, the idea of choosing two rumours about yourself to be true seems like it'd work really well.
