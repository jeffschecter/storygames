I'm not sure I even understand the distinction between something being art directly and "inspiring" art.  Is that saying that something created within a game, say a beautiful speech or impromptu poem, might be art, but that this doesn't count as the gameplay itself being art?  Again, I don't see the distinction.<br/><br/>Here are some definitions of art quickly found online:<br/><br/>"The creation of beautiful or thought-provoking works, e.g. in painting, music, or writing" (MS ENcarta)<br/><br/>"Activities enjoyed for the beauty they create or the way they present ideas, e.g. painting, music, and literature" (MS Encarta)<br/><br/>"The making or doing of something whose purpose is to bring pleasure to people through their enjoyment of what is beautiful and interesting, or things often made for this purpose, such as paintings, drawings, or sculptures" (Cambridge Dictionary of American English)<br/><br/>Isn't a story art?  If so, how is gameplay which tells a story not art?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91796/#Comment_91796" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T12:13:18+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 12:13PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gameplay isn't story.

I my self use very broad art definition, only because it suits my own agendas. If we follow the strict institutionalized art theory then artifact is only art if its made by artist (we don't want to go there, believe me). Bit broader definition would come from principle that everything that fills definitions for art-piece is art would mean that game artifact is art if its innovative and it's defining subject in question somehow. Generally speaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nGameplay: It's art. period. Except in institutional art theory, except it's played by artists :) Gameplay has all the elements of art with in it self, pretty much in same way as novel or theatrical script or play it self.

The artifact is not art (thought pieces of it may have some artistic merit), the game play may be art, in the same way that a recipe or knitting pattern is not art, but the final product could be.<br/><br/>But I am open to persuasion.<br/><br/>If RPGs can be art, are all RPGs art?  If not, what distinguishes art from not-art in this case?<br/><br/>If art lies in the artifact, not the play, is it just in the rules?  Is it still art without the layout, artwork, examples of play?

Art is primarily produced for someone to perceive. Acting isn't art if no-one's in the audience; in that case, it's rehearsal. When people start <i>watching</i> people roleplay for the sake of enjoying the performance, then it might be art.<br/><br/>As to game artifact as art, on that point I'm not sure either. What are the aesthetic qualities that signify RPG as art? I mean, I can understand that it could be appreciated as an exemplar of a <i>book</i> (for example, "Nobilis" as an example of beautiful book design). But I'm not sure that the game, qua game, is art anymore than the rules for chess are art.<br/><br/>Mind you, look at the number of people who purchase rolegame rules and supplements knowing full well that they'll never use them for actual play. Do you think these people are engaging in wishful behaviour, or a method of participation in the hobby distinct from play? If the latter, then I suppose a case could be made of the artifact as art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91809/#Comment_91809" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T12:36:18+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 12:36PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 12:37PM by Per_Fischer.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, Matt got there before me!<br/><br/>May I quote my friend Joe thanking Joe Prince after our Contenders game: "Thank you, Joe.

The right question probably needs to be something along the lines of, "Can RPGs be used for purposes other than entertainment?" <i>RPGs</i>, mind you, not the broader activity of "roleplaying," which again has therapeutic meanings that are tangential at best.<br><br>If you're going to say yes, if you're going to defend an RPG's use for purposes other than entertainment, then a whole lot of responsibility goes along with that. If an RPG is useful only as an entertainment, then your responsibility ends at providing someone a good time.<br/><br/>I have yet to see* a game that deals with "serious" issues (for purposes beyond entertainment -- education, exploration) written by anyone who actually knows what the fuck they're talking about. At best, IMO there have been some excellent designs that simulate/emulate literary treatments of such subjects. Example: Changeling, as I understand it, works from the assumption that characters are abused children. If it's anything like the first go-round, it makes no effort to simulate/emulate the experience of being an abused child. It's a standard fairy-tale starting point that's an easy touchstone for fans of, say, Neil Gaiman and other urban-fantasy writers.<br/><br/>I'd be extremely curious about the credentials and agenda behind a game like Steal Away Jordan. Is the intent to explore the experience of slavery, or to recreate the literary treatment of slavery?<br/><br/>I know this thread was started somewhat by my comment in the "subject matter" thread about whether RPGs have any business being anything other than entertainment. Yes, I know this question was asked of comic book artists (and movies, and novels, and virtually every other pop-culture medium in our lives) and obviously the answer came as a strong affirmative. So my instinct is that, yes, RPGs can be used for purposes other than "mere" entertainment. What I have yet to see is a design philosophy that also embraces the responsibility that goes with that.<br/><br/>p.<br/><br/>* "Yet to see" obviously refers only to games with which I have personal experience. I'm not omniscient.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91965/#Comment_91965" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T20:39:16+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:39PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>The right question probably needs to be something along the lines of, "Can RPGs be used for purposes other than entertainment?"</blockquote>Doesn't seem, to me, to have much connection to the first question (which may say something about what I do and don't think about art).

This was spurred by a comment Paul made in another thread, but is a subject that I've been interested in for about a year now. My purpose here was to poll this community on what I think is a relevant subject and see what kind of discussion came as a result. I knew my answer to the question before hand, but I was curious to see what other responses would be presented.<br/><br/>I think this question is a difficult one for this community for a few reasons:<br/><br/><b>-It's clear that most people won't and don't agree on what art is in the first place. </b>Asking if Story Games can be art is always going to be subjective and depend largely on an individual\xe2\u20ac\u2122s definition of art. Hoog presented one extreme when he said "if you want "art" to mean something, you have to give it a rather exclusive meaning, sticking to the traditional art forms". I lean in a different direction (I lean hard), but I don't know if there is a universal right answer here.<br/><br/><b>-Some of us don't want or need games to be</b> art. I think there are a lot of us who are happy for games to be game and not have any higher aspiration then that. I know comic artists who feel the same way about comics and actors who feel the same way about acting. Again, I don't know if there is a universal right answer here.<br/><br/><b>-It's obvious that if some games are art, certainly not all games are. </b>This creates the seemingly nasty issue that Santtu alluded to. Who is allowed to be artists? If a designer claims that her design is art, is she an artist? Is she allowed to be an artist without the recognition of her audience? <br/><br/><b>-Can games do more then just entertain?</b> I personally think that one of the primary purposes of art is to confront and examine social issues. But that may just be a "me" thing. Certainly art has to do more then entertain to be art, right? <br/><br/>Those are the questions that seem really important to me (although there are several additional important issues that are being addressed here as well). <br/><br/>(continued...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92005/#Comment_92005" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T01:32:46+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  1:32AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something else worth considering is that a Storygame is in fact a number of distinct things that are combined to make a whole (whether the whole is in fact art or not). So far most of this discussion has broken games down into two parts, the physical artifact and the gameplay. I think there is a third part as well, and it is this third part that I am primarily concerned with.<br/><br/><b>Is the physical artifact art?</b> I think most of us would agree that a book as a physical object (or scroll, or poster or whatever) can be art. Book making is recognized by many as an art form, and there is certainly any number of beautifully made and crafted books in the world.<br/><br/><b>Is the experience (gameplay) art? </b>This seems to be a matter of more contention. I think when I've seen "gameplay" mentioned in this thread it's been in the context of the social activity that results from a group of people following a games suggested rules and guidelines to create an immersive storytelling experience. The "role playing" using the games rules and suggestions. So is this art? There have been comparisons made to theatre and jazz which seem pretty apt to me. There have also been claims that the activity itself isn't art, but perhaps could inspire art in the form of a story, comic, illustration, etc*. It seems clear to me that this community has some diverse opinions on this matter.<br/><br/><b>Are designs art?</b> See, this is what I was really asking. Not whether the book a design is contained in is art and not whether the activity the design inspires is art, but whether the design itself can be art. A Story Game design exists as an entity separate from both its physical form and the reaction and response of its audience (I think this is true of all art, but I haven't put the brain hours into thinking that through yet). It's an idea that has been crafted, developed and polished. So my question, the question I wanted to ask all of you, is whether Story Game designs can be art.<br/><br/>Here's the kicker (as I see it). If Story Games (artifact, experience, design or a combination of the three) can be art, certainly not all of them ARE art. Many Story Games (maybe most) are created to be games. And if some are art, certainly not all are GOOD art. <br/><br/>As I said at the beginning of this series of posts, I think what distinguishes art from non-art is intent. If you intend to make art, then you will end up with art. Whether it's good art or bad art depends on your own skill and talent. If you have no artistic ambitions (by that I mean, if you are not setting out to create art) then your end product won't be art. You may end up with a beautiful, amazing worthwhile game, but it won't be art because that was not your intent. There's no judgment of value there. I'm not saying art is better then non-art, or that designers should create games with the goal of creating art. I actually think this is probably pretty involuntary on the part of designers. You either feel like you are creating art or you don't. And regardless of whether you are creating art at all, you certainly feel like what you are creating is worthwhile.<br/><br/>Again, this is just my own opinion. And as I said before, I think this is all pretty subjective. I think that pretty much any creative activity can be art. I think that a lot of people don't think that their designs can be art because what they do doesn't fit into their definition of what art is. I imagine there are a lot of people that are creating designs with the intent of art, without recognizing that it's okay to say that is indeed what they are doing. You have to give yourself permission to be an artist.<br/><br/>(continued...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92006/#Comment_92006" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T01:33:18+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  1:33AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, not everyone is or wants to create designs with the intent of art. This isn't a matter of denying their inner artist or anything like that. Rather, not everything of value in the world is art. I think it's perfectly possible to create a great game design without considering it to be art. I think this has been done before many times. I think it's valid for a person to say "my design is not art". I don't think that makes the design any less potentially valuable and worthwhile then someone who says "my design is art".<br/><br/><b>I'll answer my own question now: Can Story Games be art?</b><br/><br/>Yes, I think they can.<br/><br/>My own natural assumption was that Story Games were an emergent art form. I saw signs of this in the first Story Games I was exposed to. This seemed like a natural approach to me because of my own background. I've been a working artist for about 5 years and I've considered myself an artist since I was about 12. I'm also an art teacher. None of this qualifies my opinions in any way, but I hope this will give what I've been saying some context.<br/><br/>I don't think any artist considers everything they do to be art. I know that a lot of the drawing that I do, mostly freelance work, is not art. It lacks artistic intent. There is a clear difference to me when I sit down to create art. It's a difference of attention, dedication, creativity, focus, physical dexterity and interest. When I sit down to simply draw (or paint, or write) something, none of these differences come into play. When I sit down to create art, my entire existence becomes focused on the activity at hand. It's a Zen-like state of absolute creative focus. I can literally feel the difference.<br/><br/>I bring this focus to my game designs. I create my games with the intent of creating art. To me that means they are art. Are they good art? I suspect not. Dave Sim once said that you have to draw a few thousand bad drawings before you'll draw your first good one. I've designed 2 games. Clearly I'm not there yet. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So... these are my opinions, thoughts and justifications. I believe this was a question worth addressing, and I'm glad that this community agreed. I don't think we need, or should have, a clear consensus on this issue. Rather, each of us will form our own opinion, and there is a lot of value that can come out of the debate and discussion of this question.<br/><br/>Thanks for participating. I don't see any reason to stop yet.<br/><br/>Jake<br/>jake@atarashigames.com<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*My favorite thing so far in this thread was the statement that "acting isn't art if no one is in the audience". Is sculpture not art if no one is looking at it? Does the statue of david stop being art when the lights go out? Certainly art demands the context of human participation, but isn't that participation implicit in the creation of the art itself?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trevis" title="Trevis"><img alt="Trevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/353/nM6YYC8AOVW23.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trevis">Trevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92007/#Comment_92007" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T01:51:30+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  1:51AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing is, of course, story game play always has an audience.

I was trying hard to not say that, actually. Umm... I think that will be the case for some people. I think some people do put art (or the concept of "art") on a pedestal. I don't think that creating a game without the intent of art makes the game inferior to something that was created with the intent of art. It's just a difference of intent. It may be unavoidable that "art games" become looked at differently then "normal games", in the same way that "art comics" are looked at differently then "normal comics". I don't think that this has to be a bad thing. The important thing to remember is that different does not mean better.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92021/#Comment_92021" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T04:13:19+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  4:13AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 4:13AM by Joe_Beason.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite><br> I don't think that creating a game without the intent of art makes the game inferior to something that was created with the intent of art.

The right question probably needs to be something along the lines of, "Can RPGs be used for purposes other than entertainment?"<i>RPGs</i>, mind you, not the broader activity of "roleplaying," which again has therapeutic meanings that are tangential at best.<br/><br/>If you're going to say yes, if you're going to defend an RPG's use for purposes other than entertainment, then a whole lot of responsibility goes along with that. If an RPG is useful only as an entertainment, then your responsibility ends at providing someone a good time.<br/><br/>I have yet to see* a game that deals with "serious" issues (for purposes beyond entertainment -- education, exploration) written by anyone who actually knows what the fuck they're talking about. At best, IMO there have been some excellent designs that simulate/emulate literary treatments of such subjects. Example: Changeling, as I understand it, works from the assumption that characters are abused children. If it's anything like the first go-round, it makes no effort to simulate/emulate the experience of being an abused child. It's a standard fairy-tale starting point that's an easy touchstone for fans of, say, Neil Gaiman and other urban-fantasy writers.<br/><br/>I'd be extremely curious about the credentials and agenda behind a game like Steal Away Jordan. Is the intent to explore the experience of slavery, or to recreate the literary treatment of slavery?</blockquote>\nYour point about responsibility is interesting - but wrapped around an insultingly phrased assumption that people designing games are unqualified to address serious topics. From my perspective, if designer A has read a few books about a subject that I know little and is thoughtful about how they structure the game experience, system, advice etc, then their game <b>can</b> educate me and allow me to explore the topic. I won't come out of the game with the depth or subtlety of knowledge &amp; experience than I would if I spent years studying or living the issue- but I'll have some exposure, a chance to think about the issue, and to address it through role-playing, collaborative narration, or whatever techniques the game uses. Most rpgs/story games list their sources and often the designer writes a bit about why they are interested in the subject, so there is a baseline of transparency as to the origins of the ideas within. If you have a higher threshold of expertise, that's fine, but I'm not sure to what end. <br/><br/>On the more useful issue of responsibility, if a game is designed to educate, then one can draw upon the pedagogical lessons of a generation of classroom learning/simulation games and the newer serious games movement focused on computer games. I'm intrigued by the potential for advocacy games, say a rpg where characters are fighters in a low intensity civil war and the point of the game is to convince players to get active in the movement to restrict the global trade in small arms. Does the designer have an obligation to say up front that this game is intended to convince you of X or Y? Should the designed try to affiliate with/ get feedback from existing networks or advocacy groups working on that issue?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kent" title="Kent"><img alt="Kent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kent">Kent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92123/#Comment_92123" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T09:17:57+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  9:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Why is "not just for entertainment value" related to artistic quality?

Absolutely. I'm not apologizing for it. When I look at a "serious" RPG, an RPG that aspires to something more than light entertainment, I have yet to get any sense that the designer has any meaningful insight into the issue. No, I'm not going to name specific titles. The answer probably is, my threshold is higher than yours, and that's cool.<br/><br/>On a related note: There's a whole generation of movie makers out there whose entire life experience has been <i>watching movies.</i> Their resulting work is nothing more than a pastiche of other movie influences, because they bring nothing of themselves into the work. There's nothing to bring! The result may be stylish (Michael Bay, Quentin Tarantino, etc.) but there's no truth within it. <br/><br/>I'm concerned this is happening in game design as well: Games designed by folks whose entire life experience is other games. That, for me, is where the responsibility of an artist comes in. You have to be true to your subject. Work from what you know -- just the same as other serious media. That is, if you want your work to aspire to the level of "art", and take the work beyond artsy/stylish entertainment, your insights and experiences need to come from the real world.<br/><br/>Personally? I'm all for designing artsy/stylist entertainments. I think RPGs do them well and there's a <i>lot</i> of additional exploration to be done, and I personally derive a lot of pleasure from entertaining people. But if I wanted to use an RPG for purposes beyond entertainment, I'd be absolutely certain I was true to the topic or issue or theme. That has to involve more than scouring history books for hooks.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92132/#Comment_92132" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T09:27:02+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  9:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kent</cite><br/>Why is "not just for entertainment value" related to artistic quality?

Other then to say that when you intend to create art you have a higher level of commitment to that which you are creating.<br/><br/>This is perfectly fine, different things require different levels of commitment.<br/><br/>I think that a cheap definition of art is its longevity, a more interesting definition is its ability to engage an audience (of which I think we are when we play in a SG or RPG.) But without the intent of creating art is that which is created any less artful, even though it might be emotionally engaging, sometimes even more engaging then those things that have the particular intent?<br/><br/>There is nothing we can do today to determine whether something is art other then to say, "This is art, because I deem it so" whether you are the artist, the critic, or the viewer. This should in no way belittle the strong efforts made by some.<br/><br/>I believe you (Jake) create art, not because your intent was to create art but because I enjoyed (my emotion) it, thus, I contacted you to do the art for unWritten. I believe Polaris is art, because of its presentation, its beauty, and how it is able to merge the presentation with the experience it elicits. I also believe Lacuna is art and I've never played it.<br/><br/>So to answer your three questions. Yes, I believe every aspect of a game can be art, in fact I would go so far as to say it's probably the newest artform. So long as it elicits the "this is art" response from its audience or engages the audience on an emotional level.<br/><br/>alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Santtu" title="Santtu"><img alt="Santtu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Santtu">Santtu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92210/#Comment_92210" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T11:09:08+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 11:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alex, I hear what you're saying and probably agree on quite a few points. How ever I insist that intention changes the product. If there's two people working with same concepts and ideas, but others intention in his/her work is artistic and others merely (merely used with all respect) entertaining, then the end products would look quite different. And that does make huge impact on how story games or rpgs in general are viewed from art world perspective and probably by consumers as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has so far been and hopefully will continue as the best discussion on Story Games forum that I've read, thank you fellow posters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92214/#Comment_92214" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T11:16:49+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 11:16AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 11:19AM by Joe_Beason.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

But that doesn't mean that the definition of art is therefore up to the owners of the factories.</blockquote>\nThe way I use the words, the pre-mass production stuff was for the most part craft, not art.  The difference is that in craft, utility comes before aesthetic appeal.  It doesn't matter how beautiful a carpenter's chair is if I can't sit on it.  <br/><br/>I think of my knitting this way.  While I want it to be aesthetically appealing to me, and hopefully others, it's a failure if it doesn't work as a garment.   I have seen and admired knitted art, such as fiber sculptures.  But the priority there was aesthetics, not utility.  Indeed, utility was never on the table.<br/><br/>I admit the categories shade into each other, too.  There's lots of artifacts in art museums that are admired primarily for their beauty, but were created primarily for their usefulness.

I agree that a lot (I don't know if I'd say most, but you may be right) is just for entertainment.  I'm not saying that art has to be more then that. I'm saying that I believe that is one of the primary purposes of art. But reading that again, it doesn't sound right.

Other then to say that when you intend to create art you have a higher level of commitment to that which you are creating.<br/><br/>This is perfectly fine, different things require different levels of commitment.<br/><br/>I think that a cheap definition of art is its longevity, a more interesting definition is its ability to engage an audience (of which I think we are when we play in a SG or RPG.) But without the intent of creating art is that which is created any less artful, even though it might be emotionally engaging, sometimes even more engaging then those things that have the particular intent?<br/><br/>There is nothing we can do today to determine whether something is art other then to say, "This is art, because I deem it so" whether you are the artist, the critic, or the viewer. This should in no way belittle the strong efforts made by some.<br/><br/>I believe you (Jake) create art, not because your intent was to create art but because I enjoyed (my emotion) it, thus, I contacted you to do the art for unWritten. I believe Polaris is art, because of its presentation, its beauty, and how it is able to merge the presentation with the experience it elicits. I also believe Lacuna is art and I've never played it.<br/><br/>So to answer your three questions. Yes, I believe every aspect of a game can be art, in fact I would go so far as to say it's probably the newest artform. So long as it elicits the "this is art" response from its audience or engages the audience on an emotional level.<br/><br/>alex</blockquote>\nhmm. I'm mostly thinking of this from my own point of view. I recently did an illustration for a client that I wasn't really happy with. I didn't consider it art. Later, a friend of mine saw it and really, really liked it. he asked if she could have the original art. I told her it wasn't really something I liked that much, and I didn't really consider it to be in my "art pile" (as opposed to my non-art pile). She totally disagreed,and said that it was definitely art. So who's ri-ht? I guess we both are. I guess art is in the eye of the beholder. What I was saying was said from the point of view of a designer though. I wasn't really taking the audiences opinions into consideration.<br/><br/>Does that make sense at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92253/#Comment_92253" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T12:11:53+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 12:11PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So back to the RPGs, I'm drawn to the concept of the craft of design, but shy away from the concept of the art of design.

The difference lies in priorities.  If the incredibly beautiful table has a sloped surface, it's not very useful as a table.  The artist keeps the slope because it's true to the aesthetic, the craftsman rejects the slope because utility is more important.<br/><br/>Jake, I think this speaks to the distinction you made between your freelance work and your personal work.  You don't perceive your freelance work as art, but I imagine you try to do inject your style and sensibility within the constraints of the project.  So at some level aesthetics comes into it.  But the more important aspect is that the piece meet the criteria of the client, which is its utility.<br/><br/>The two categories bleed into each other, and it's not as if there's a utility/aesthetics setting in our heads.  Some mighty fine artwork has been done on spec for rich patrons.

How?</blockquote>\nKent, I think the answer is yes, but I don't know if I can really wrap my head far enough around this to satisfy the question in any real way. Certainly entertainment can be art and art can be entertainment, but I think just because a ting is entertainment does not mean it is art. I'm entertained by puppies, but I don't think puppies are art. Or car crashes. I saw a car slam into another car the other day. I watched it happen (and saw it coming), watched the drivers get out and argue, watched the police arrive and watched a crowd form. i was entertained, but I can't see that as art. Of course, if one driver had intended to smash into the otehr as some kind of performance piece or something...<br/><br/>Now I assume that what you were asking is if works created or act performed to be entertainments are different then art. I don't know. I don't think so, but this is a pretty broad category of stuff. I guess this would include anything a person did, said or produced that was meant to entertain. Certainly this includes art (I mean stuff classically recognized as art), but this would also include sports, snapping fingers, telling jokes, farting at just the right time and a whole bunch of sex. I think it's all about intent. And the flip side of that is perception. So if a person intends any of this stuff to be art, then yeah, I think it is. <br/><br/>So my answer is no, I think.<br/><br/>jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92577/#Comment_92577" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T10:04:34+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 10:04AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite><br/>So back to the RPGs, I'm drawn to the concept of the craft of design, but shy away from the concept of the art of design.

Another is intent. So maybe art is something that someone had the Intent to show to an Audience. I might also toss in a sense in which knowing that it will be observed by an audience influences the product. You adjust how you play knowing this (maybe try to make it more entertaining on viewing, or educational, or emphasize some theme, or such). I'm also of the view that we don't want such an infinitely expansive definition that the term becomes meaningless.  So by this view, there are a few avenues in which gameplay can become art:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You record the gameplay, knowing that you or others plan to watch it later, and adjust play accordingly <br/>\n2. There is someone watching you play, and the players are conscious of this and adjust their play accordingly.<br/>\n3. You play... and dedicate part of your awareness to actively appreciating what others are doing around you at that moment (jargon - story now), _and are aware that others are doing the same to you_. Players are both participants and spectators, and are aware of this.<br/>\n4. One player, Alfred, is aware others are watching; other players are focused on what Alfred is doing. An extreme example of this is pure-storytelling - one person tells a story, everyone else passively listens. Small deviations from pure storytelling would also work.<br/>\n<br/>\nNon-art would be:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Everybody is focussed on elements of gameplay or general socializing or the like. No one is dedicating any significant awareness to observing the "big picture" and no one is expecting anyone to be doing so and therefore no one adjusts behavior accordingly. <br/>\n<br/>\nExample A: boardgame  a player is either executing moves, or thinking about next moves, or observing other players moves solely for purposes of choosing one's one next move. <br/>\n<br/>\nExample B: Social hang out. Players are focused on socializing and hanging out with their friends, what is happening "in game" is relatively unimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample C: combinations of A and B. <br/>\n<br/>\nExample D: One or more players are entirely focused on portraying one or more "PCs" as best they can, subject to social constraints and mores. One or more players are designated as "GMs" who focus on portraying assorted "NPCs" and setting elements and adjudicating disputes between PCs, NPCs, etc. Nobody sits back during play and contemplates the big picture and/or nobody is expecting anyone else to be sitting back and soaking in the big picture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92606/#Comment_92606" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T12:30:04+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 12:30PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2007 12:35PM by Moreno R..">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am no expert on Art, but these are my considerations.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I can't define exactly what is a "story-game", so I will talk about games that provoke and promote a narrativistic agenda during the game, and of the use of these for "meaningful" premises (that "meaningful" is problematic because every premise is meaningful for definition, but I couldn't find a word to define the way some premises are more meaningful than others)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) If we ask ourselves if role-playing game can be art, then we must try to see them like an artistic form, by themselves. I mean, if we play so well that someone who filmed our gaming session would enjoy it like a stage play.. well, this mean that that was a "stage play that was art", and don't tell us anything about the question about role-playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) We must divorce the "story" from the "way of telling the story". When we play a narrativist game and get a story, that story is not a movie, it's not a novel, it's not a song. It's a role-playing session. So any accusation about the fact that rpg can't be art because they don't are movies, novels or songs is meaningless.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) I didn't study art. What little I know about art comes from reading some Umberto Eco and Milan Kundera a lot of time ago, so I could be very wrong here, but I think that to get art you must have a creative expression of some kind that is meaningful both to the artist and to the audience, and must provoke the audience in getting a personal reaction (without this personal reaction, if the emotions and the response of the audience are pre-fixed by the communication of the artist, you don't have art, you gave propaganda or kitsch).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, creating art with paintings or novels is very difficult, and not many people really do it. It's difficult to get a personal reaction from a faceless public you don't know, it's difficult writing about something of personal and meaningful importance to a faceless public. It's hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in narrativistic role-playing games, it's authomatic, if people engage the game and play honstly.  The players are not only the audience, but the only audience that specific game session will ever have. If it's meaningful to them, it's meaningful for everybody who could ever experience it. But if they simply follow the rules and engage the game (I mean, if the game don't fall flat with people looking at their watches), they <b>will</b> create a story meaningful to them (so, to both creators and to audience) and every one will have a personal reaction (what they do in the game) to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, narrativistic rpgs are, after all, an "authomatic machine to get art". What you will get, if you play honestly using in the story what has meaning to the people at the table, will always be art. No matter if it will be badly acted, with cliched dialogue and the end result would be stupid, banal, moronic, in the eyes of everybody who didn't play it. it will stil be art for you both as a creator and as the only audience that will ever experience it.<br/>\n<br/>\n(being art doesn't guarantee that it will be GOOD art. For that, as in every artistic field, you will have to improve your skills, dig deeper into your soul, and get better instruments - and that is the work of the game designers)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is huge. Is a really big difference with the other artistic fields where getting art is difficult, but usually you FIRST get reasonably good stuff (readable books, songs made by people who at least know how to use a musical instrument, etc.) and THEN only a tiny little percentage of that good stuff will be art.   And it's in my opinion one of the reasons we people interested in "stories" like to use some hours every week to play these games that create our badly-acted little stories instead of using that time to see another movie with the same friends. If we didn't play rpgs we would have to become good writers or painters to be able to create even a little art, and we would risk a very high failure rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think that yes, narrativistc games session can easily be art. But they "cheat" by having both creators and audience in the same persons (really, it's too easy this way...), so I still would not put a good role-player on a par with the people who can write art in the form of a novel (I wonder how they can do it. I mean, it's freaking hard to create art for somebody that isn't right there with you telling you what you can do that is meaningful for them...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92716/#Comment_92716" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T05:20:10+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  5:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Joe, is your head inhabited by magpies?

It's a category that include a lot of wll-loved things created for people's enjoyment (in Eco's essay <i>apocalittici e Integrati</i>, that I think was only partially translated in english as <i>"Apocalypse Postponed"</i>,  "Superman" and "Lil' Abner" were classified like kitsch.

I posted it only because I found it interesting that, by that definition, narrative games are something of an authomatic machine to create art. But I don't invest no particolar importance to this.

When you look at an ad and I look at an ad, we'll appreciate different things about it. You might see nostalgia and vintage things, I might see a link to the past and an exploration of my grandfather's world. There is no such thing as a generic response to advertising and marketing.<br/><br/>Marketing is a type of art designed to sell things.<br/><br/>Here:<br/><br/>Some writers churn out books at an alarming rate. Some of these authors I consider pathetic money-slaves who compromise artistic integrity and sell cheap drivel. Daniel Steel is one example. Some of these exact same authors I consider groundbreaking authors who've written a fascinating library and redefined genres. Stephen King is one example.<br/><br/>Daniel Steel writes books to sell them. I do not consider her an artist. I consider her stupid.<br/>Stephen King writes books to sell them. I consider him an artist.<br/><br/>There are similar parallels in other art forms, but this one's a good one.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that creating images (visual, mental, literary, whatever) and evoking responses... that's kind of what art's about. I don't think it has anything to do with the end goals of these images and responses. Even if the end goal is profit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93095/#Comment_93095" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T23:07:41+00:00" title="September  4, 2007 11:07PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jake,<br/><br/>It seems like people are still mostly talking about game as artifacts or games as play.<br/><br/>But I'm really super interested in your question of whether a design can be art.<br/><br/>There's an artist (name cannot be recalled) who's work is almost all interactive... A table with a bone on a string, a clay pot, and a tin pot. And curious gallery goers would stare at it blankly for a while, then eventually grab the bone and... hold it to their ear. turn it about in their hands. Listen to it. Imagine it being something.<br/><br/>Those kinds of installations proved that art can be two things:<br/>a.) Something created to evoke certain responses.<br/>b.) Something created to evoke certain interactions.<br/><br/>A play is meant to be watched and appreciated.<br/>Improv (the kind with audience suggestions, etc) is meant to be participated in and appreciated.<br/><br/>A magic show is art, and it often involves pulling audience members into the show - the fact that THEY are unscripted and unprepared for what the magician has prepared adds to the magic and mystique. It adds to the art.<br/><br/>I think that interactions can be art. That includes improv, for example. That also includes picking up the bone on a string in the aforementioned example.<br/><br/>Now, I think that if you count <span style="text-decoration: underline;">picking up </span>the bone on a string as art (I do. Maybe you don't. That's cool), then you have to wonder what the physical object itself is. Is it art? Is it the blueprints for art? Is it art which inspires a second art? If the point is that people pick up the bone and bowls and re-arrange them and such... and THAT is the art, are the DESIGNS for that art... are they art as well?<br/><br/>I'd like to say yes. And if you've followed me this far, I'm surprised. I feel very rambly.<br/><br/>My point is: I think game designs are an art designed to provoke a second art. They are an art designed to provoke an interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93112/#Comment_93112" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T03:36:36+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  3:36AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd like to say yes.

This was mostly how my thought process on the subject presented itself as well (minus the creepy bone stuff).<br/><br/> I've been thinking about this for awhile, but it became an issue in my mind a few months ago with a topic here on Story Games where someone (I can't remember who) asserted that when they bought a game they were paying for the physical artifact and labor, but not the idea. I claimed that the idea was the product, that the mental work involved in developing that idea was 90% of the work involved in creating the final product, and when they paid for that product what they were paying for was mostly the idea (or at least that was what i was selling. I suppose some people buy the cookies for the packaging). Some people agreed with this, some didn't. I couldn't understand the opposing veiw at all. This was how I created my art. The creative process was a vital part of the development of that art. Then it occured to me that maybe these other people didn't see what we were doing as art (of course maybe they did and just disagreed with me). Since I did see game design as an art, I kind of assumed everyone did. Of course, the question of whether game design is art wasn't really that important to my original arguement that when you purchase a game part of what you are paying for is the idea, but that was how I first began to wonder whether game designers and players considered games and game design to be art.<br/><br/>After you, Ryan, John, Nick and I played Cheap in Seattle, you took a minute to explain to us how the game worked. You passed the rules of the game to us verbaly. I had been thinking about games as art all that day, and when we were playing Cheap I was convinced that we were creating art, or at least participating in art. When you explained the game to us I could see the art in it. When you gave us permission to play and share the experience with others it became art as an oral tradition.

Those are &amp;%!#%ing sharp!  But what if they worked with brush and ink?  Then you'd just spend the rest of the day saying "Man, there is just <b>nothing</b> that will get this mess off my skin, much less my clothes!  And besides, it tickled like the dickens!"<br/><br/>I'll add my voice to the chorus of folks saying that advertising and marketing is a subset of art.  But then, as stated above, I think it's <i>really, really hard</i> not to create art.  What you can do is not <i>notice</i> that you're creating art.<br/><br/>Each and every one of the posts in this thread?  Art.

I recently did an illustration for a client that I wasn't really happy with. I didn't consider it art. Later, a friend of mine saw it and really, really liked it. he asked if she could have the original art. I told her it wasn't really something I liked that much, and I didn't really consider it to be in my "art pile" (as opposed to my non-art pile). She totally disagreed,and said that it was definitely art. So who's ri-ht? I guess we both are. I guess art is in the eye of the beholder. What I was saying was said from the point of view of a designer though. I wasn't really taking the audiences opinions into consideration.<br/><br/>Does that make sense at all?</blockquote>\nI'm opposed to defining art by intent and/or audience -- because I feel that it ties into modernism, which can encourage self-indulgent works like a featureless black ball or splattered paint that is "art" because the artist had some deep thought about it.  I'm post-modernist myself, and feel that the emphasis should be on what it actually means to people rather than what the artist intended it to mean.  Art is creative production of aesthetic products.  The historical use of "art" is often as the opposite to "nature" -- i.e. art is anything intentionally created by people, as opposed to natural.  <br/><br/>I think what's telling is that people nearly always use the term art as elevated over non-art.  You disagreed with this in principle earlier, but I note that the work you had classed as non-art was one you weren't happy with.  <br/><br/>Outside of semantics, I think that there should be more emphasis on local creativity.  These days, much of our creative life is passive -- watching mass-produced movies, listening to mass-produced music, and reading mass-produced books.  I favor more direct creativity -- i.e. playing or singing rather than putting on a CD, decorating by hand rather than buying something off the shelf, and indeed playing RPGs rather than just watching a movie.  There's nothing inherently wrong with passive consumption, but I do feel that it is overly dominant these days.  Thus, I prefer that there is not an elevated term for popular, often-mass-produced creative works over more personal creative works.  <br/><br/>If someone paints a beautiful, inspiring picture -- it shouldn't matter if it was to make money, to get into someone's pants, or to please themselves.  I don't feel that we should question, say, the poetry of Emily Dickinson because her intent for them wasn't clear.  <br/><br/>I've talked about this a number of times on my LiveJournal -- cf. my <br/><br/>[url=<a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/tag/art][b]My" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/tag/art][b]My</a> LJ tag on "art"[/b][/url]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93495/#Comment_93495" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T11:16:14+00:00" title="September  6, 2007 11:16AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You disagreed with this in principle earlier, but I note that the work you had classed as non-art was one you weren't happy with.</blockquote>\ntrue. but I can think of a few examples of work that I created that I was very pleased with that I don't consider art as well. <br/><br/>In any case, this is just my personal view. I'm not presenting it as an argument or universal truth.\n<blockquote>Thus, I prefer that there is not an elevated term for popular, often-mass-produced creative works over more personal creative works.</blockquote>\nI agree. Was I offering a term? If so, I don't think I meant to. Can you point it out to me?\n<blockquote>I don't feel that we should question, say, the poetry of Emily Dickinson because her intent for them wasn't clear. </blockquote>\nYeah, I guess you are right. As I said before, my original statements were from the perspective of a creator of works and not an audience for those works. Or maybe as an audience that creates works, I guess. I wasn't really interested in talking about the other side, how the audience perceives the work and whether or not it is art if the audience perceives it as art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4100/can-story-games-be-art" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4100/can-story-games-be-art" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4100/can-story-games-be-art/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4100%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4100%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
