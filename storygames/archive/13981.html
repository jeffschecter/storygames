Nothing too hyper-realistic, I just want everything to make logical sense, help with the suspension of disbelief, and make the world and characters come to life. I'm probably being a little overly ambitious in terms of the level of detail, but I thought I would give an example of how a lot of this design process is interconnected (and why this is taking so long).<br/><br/>I decided to design the currency used by Humans on Ortellum, the actual look of the bills and coins.  While that was interesting and lead to developing some details in the game world, things didn't start to become interesting until I had to figure out a seemingly simple detail: <br/>What denominations of currency did I actually need? <br/><br/>This seemingly simple question lead to my researching modern day nuclear reactors, hydroelectric power, the power usage of various appliances, the cost of electricity, the price of bread, numerous statistics on several countries, the diet of medieval peasants and their occupations, and the caloric content of a variety of foods.<br/><br/>As this was a rather long process and resulted in a two-part blog post (I hesitate to post the actual word count, for fear of discouraging would-be readers), I shamelessly direct you to the full posts at <a href="http://www.base113.com/games/entry.php?20-Reactors-Kennas-and-Caloric-Content-Part-1" rel="nofollow">Reactors Kennas and Caloric Content Part 1</a>.

But in the end, you came up with a result that doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Currency is tied to power. I get that, and I like it.<br/><br/>But a common laborer makes 200 Kennas a day. And it takes 100 Kennas worth of power just to run a fridge. That doesn't sound like much of an improvement over medieval standards of living, if you can't afford a fridge. And a heater.<br/><br/>And after all that, the coinage doesn't make any sense either. The lowest amount that's in bills is 50% of a laborer's wage.<br/><br/>Bills are used to reduce production costs. Coins are expensive to produce.<br/><br/>The good thing about your coin choices is that they use a 4-5 ratio per level, rather than the crappy D&amp;D 10:1 ratio (which looks good on paper, but sucks in reality - I've seen it in play several times at LARPs and it requires tons more coinage per capita to make the economy function than a 4-5:1 ratio.)<br/><br/>In a future society, I can see coins being eliminated altogether. It makes much more sense to me that, for example, you might keep a handful of thin, credit card like objects in your wallet for currency. Common currency transfers would basically just involve typing in an amount and touching cards together. For giving someone currency without touching cards, you could keep disposable cards on you - transfer an amount to a disposable currency card and hand it off.<br/><br/>Heck, with a power = currency connection, perhaps batteries would act as currency for those who want to make transactions that are completely "off the grid". I'm sure batteries that far in the future would be much more powerful for their size. Improving batteries is one of the major pushes in tech right now.<br/><br/>Also, keep in mind that there's a huge difference between income and spending cash. Representing that difference effectively in an RPG is super hard. It's often best just to focus on spending cash and ignore the rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316865/#Comment_316865" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T15:39:29+00:00" title="March 16, 2011  3:39PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2011 3:41PM by John_Powell.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you really need physical currency at all?

I should explain a little more about my setting, it may be set in the future, but it's not exactly futuristic.  After a worldwide disaster, power is a luxury.  The reality is that a common laborer will probably not be making much use of electricity.  There is also a considerable gap between the poor and wealthy.<br/><br/>The currency was designed to replace energy credits (transctions were handled electronically before the Cataclysm).  Because of the complexity of the bills and the lack of abundant electricty to power computers and printers, as well as access to certain resources, means that it's actually easier to produce coins than bills.  Most mining is actually conducted by another race.  Humanity is currently in a sort of middle ground between being a fairly advanced civilization and reestablishing a more primitive society.  They are having to rediscover techniques that haven't been used in decades or longer.<br/><br/>The currency is not really based on electricity at this point.  It was in the past, but when Humans switched from credits to kennas, it kind of lost its meaning.  These Humans essentially had to start a society and government from scratch with no preparation.  They made mistakes, and this is going to become more and more obvious in the near future.<br/><br/>If you haven't guessed, I have very little understanding of modern day currency.  I would be very interested in what you think the short and long term effects of all this would be, both economic and for society in general.  If the currency denominations are off based on the laborers wages, what will happen?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316954/#Comment_316954" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T12:54:37+00:00" title="March 17, 2011 12:54PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok. So you're basically doing Dark Angel - In Spaaaaace! <br/><br/>I get that, except that I have a hard time seeing how it would be easier to introduce a coinage based economy from scratch than it would be to fix an electrical infrastructure. Sure, on a 1000 person scale, you can rig up a drop-press and set some laborers to work on it for a few weeks, assuming you have a source for slugs. But for a million people, it's a heck of a lot of work. Plus, producing the slugs requires lots of heat energy, which could be turned into electricity. And that seems like a much higher priority.<br/><br/>In order to have a working coinage economy, you need to have approximately twice the the increment (the increment from a 1 K coin to a 5 K coin is 5, so you need twice that, 10) per person. So for 1 million people, you need 10 million pennies. The real coinage needed is probably higher than that, actually, but that's pretty much the bare minimum to expect to work with. Producing coinage on that scale takes heavy machinery, which in turn takes lots of electricity.<br/><br/>Currency denominations aren't "based off" anything except usability. If you look at coinage denominations from around the world, you'll find that they very often increment at 4 or 5 per increment.<br/><br/>Look at the most commonly used US coins. They follow that pattern.<br/>5 pennies to a nickle<br/>5 nickles to a quarter<br/>4 quarters to a dollar<br/>5 dollars to a fiver<br/>4 fivers to a twenty<br/>5 twenties to a benjamin<br/><br/>Sure, there's also dimes and tens. But they're produced in much smaller amounts and used much less. If they were removed completely, there would be almost no impact, especially since there are almost no dime-based coin-op machines left in use.<br/><br/>Other currencies tend to use similar increments.<br/><br/>And note, it's common to change the name at some point - dollars and cents, pounds and pence, etc.<br/><br/>The thing is, for most RPG players, the concept of electricity as luxury isn't nearly tangible enough. They don't care that their character is cold at night. They just want a bigger gun. Or more magic.<br/><br/>Having currency linked to ammunition or "mana" is one of the few times that a game economy will become meaningful to the players. The Hell on Earth setting, where bullets were currency and everyone was pretty poor, was one of the few games where players actually had a good reason to track their money closely. If you do that, you need to make sure that guns are enough better to be worth the trouble to track bullets. Otherwise, players will just go primitive and swing clubs at baddies.<br/><br/>That is, assuming you're running something with some action content. If you're just running politics and such, then it matters less. But, in that case, fleshing out the currency to that detail is probably a waste of time.<br/><br/>The biggest thing to keep in mind when world building - exactly how are you going to use it at the table. If you're not, then you should be spending your time on something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Natai" title="Natai"><img alt="Natai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Natai">Natai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317028/#Comment_317028" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T19:38:19+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  7:38PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a persistent phenomenon that interferes with eletrical current, resulting in electronics being unreliable in some areas and burning out in others.  These areas are also constantly shifting, so while some steps have been taken to protect electrical devices brownouts are common.  Power is also frequently shut off as a precautionary measure.  There are centralized charging stations, but electricity is expensive as are batteries or any similar power storage device.  There's more to it than that, but the bottom line is that any electrical infrastructure is virtually impossible.  There are a couple of small exceptions, but those are rigidly controlled by those in power.<br/><br/>Another species on the planet is responsible for the vast majority of mining on the planet.  Humans are establishing small mining operations, but that is creating diplomatic problems.  Barter is also probably being used in some small areas as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
