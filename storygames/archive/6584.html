Insert usual caveats that all groups are different, people like different things, etc -- we're shooting for a best guess.<br/><br/>Succeed is the key word here. It doesn't do a lot of good to say "ooh, go play Shock! It's rocks!"* when that's such a big leap from what they're used to that they don't have a good time and never want to try anything experimental ever again.<br/><br/>So far I'm hovering on:<br/><br/>Agon -- Includes mechanical combat that feels like a traditional game (you can run around fighting monsters, your spear does X damage). Lots of resource management and advancement, so the players might not initially notice they are competing in a very un-D&amp;D like way. Players can also ease into steering the plot, framing scenes to get advantages, etc. One downside is <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/20/perils-of-abstract-defeat/" rel="nofollow">abstract defeat</a>, which may prove slippery at first.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age -- A farther leap, but wins because it includes an adventure seed to get players started (would you normally choose to play a virgin sacrifice? No, but the oracle prompts you). Even if they don't immediately grok negotiation they can fall back on just inflicting damage and learn as they go. The GM sets scenes and can use NPCs to provoke situations so the players aren't dropped in the deep end.<br/><br/>There are some games that seemed like a good idea but I'm rejecting for this purpose (they would be in the advanced course, but not the starter kit). For example Truth &amp; Justice: great game, but being able to bring in any trait as a bonus if you can explain it is probably too big a jump for players used to literal rule systems. It's likely to feel too easy to gain an arbitrary advantage.<br/><br/>So what games am I missing? Suggest some (or reject the ones I've got) and tell me why.<br/><br/><br/><i>* Yes it's true, Shock rocks.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146290/#Comment_146290" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T18:45:17+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  6:45PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If they are going to have a problem with "trait as a  bonus" you're going to have a tough time.

Compare it to something like SotC where there's a cost to bring in each trait.<br/><br/>It's just a very different system than D&amp;D, which has little or no negotiable bonuses, just literal situational bonuses (I am 10th level, my sword is +2, I have surprise).<br/><br/>At least that's been my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146296/#Comment_146296" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T19:11:25+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  7:11PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            isn't Burning Wheel a frequent suggestion for this kind of situation?<br/>the potential problem seems to be that if you're trying something that superficially looks very similar to D&amp;D but has some very crucial differences, people might have more trouble with the differences because they expect the whole thing to be like D&amp;D...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146297/#Comment_146297" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T19:14:38+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  7:14PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Jeffrey Straszheim&lt;/cite&gt;Please stop suggesting that folks become more "advanced" when they play story games.

I've done this quite succesfully with my own campaign, though my players didn't need any convincing.<br><br>For example you might introduce Keys from TSoY as a way of gaining XP - I know somebody already did this, but I can't remember who and where.<br><br>You can also add the Gift of Dice in this manner: Create a pool of d4s. For any d20-roll, another player can give a d4 as a positive modifer. In order to give the die, the players must fulfill a criteria, this could be some narrative element etc.<br/><br/>Also in my campaign about teenage wizards at The Great School of Magic in Glantri, players gain minor spellboosts, if they describe how their master taught them to cast the spell. Is adds flavor and focuses on the various Noble Wizard Houses and their ways of doing magic. <br/><br/>Furthermore I changed the mechanic "Aid Another", which is normally used in combat, where you spend an action to give a fellow a +2 bonus. Now you gain a +2 bonus to a any skillcheck, if you play out a non-conflict scene, in which you gain the assistance of another character. We have several library-scenes, where they discuss exams, ancient tomes and the latest gossip while studying, as this gains them the necessary +2 modifiers for some otherwise very difficult skillchecks.<br/><br/>From Mortal Coil we added the MagicTokens, that allow you to state a fact about the setting. We use them for interplanar adventures, where the players can add all sorts of cool details to the setting. <br/><br/>So borrow mechanics from other games, add them one by one, and let your players know, that these houserules are added to make their characters more cool and give them more options - as none of the added rules can be used against them.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146418/#Comment_146418" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T10:42:17+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 10:42AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 10:42AM by Chris Peterson.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Morten Greis</cite>For example you might introduce Keys from TSoY as a way of gaining XP - I know somebody already did this, but I can't remember who and where.</blockquote>\nYou're thinking of Clinton's <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/sweet20/experience.html" rel="nofollow">Sweet20 XP</a>.<br/><br/>Also, Vincent has some good advice (from his old "Roleplaying Theory, Hardcore" blog) about introducing task vs conflict resolution to non-narrativist games:<br/><br/>* <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/hardcore.html#4" rel="nofollow">Conflict Resolution vs. Task Resolution</a><br/>* <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/hardcore.html#7" rel="nofollow">Practical Conflict Resolution Advice</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146421/#Comment_146421" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T10:45:04+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 10:45AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 10:45AM by Chris Peterson.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Burning Wheel (too crunchy) and Sorcerer (too loose/hippie) would be too much game.

Also, a lot of stuff is accessible, but it still forces the player to voice what is important to them and then go get it!<br/>\n  Barring that, I have had tremendous luck introducing trad gamers to DITV. I try and frame the game concept as a cross between playing a Paladin in D&amp;D, playing Cain from that Kung Fu TV show and/or one of the good guys from the A-Team. I mean you wander from town to town saving the town. A comparison to the Blues Brothers might work too. The only resistance I ever got from running ditv was from people who did not want to play a dogmatic jerk. There are techniques you can use to assuage those fears, so let me know and I'll hook you up if you want to go that way, k?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146517/#Comment_146517" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T16:51:17+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  4:51PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The group I play D&amp;D with took rather handily to Spirit of the Century, though it did take us a bit to get the concept of aspects down. All-in-all though, things like the feat/stunt correspondence made it not too difficult a transition, though it did take some players a while to get used to the thought that they don't have to worry about concepts like attacks of opportunity and flanking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
