The big historical answers are as follows:<br/><b>*</b> If it's a challenging wargame sort of deal, you'll want to design the adventure as a <i>scenario</i>, detailing the terrain and opposition in whatever terms the GM will need to run the situation effortlessly and fairly. Older D&amp;D has scenarios like this.<br/><b>*</b> If it's a GM's story hour kind of game, you'll want to design the adventure as an intricate <i>story</i>, with all the names and dates and handouts made easy to use; don't waste time on counterhypotheticals of "what if the adventurers do not follow the rails" - just lay down the single-line story, focus on impressive presentation, and leave it up to the game system and GM to keep the story on rails or adapt to deviations. Games like <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> have some really impressive adventure texts of this sort.<br/><b>*</b> If the game has a big skirmish combat subgame at its center (either it's the core of the game like D&amp;D 4th, or it's the bribe the GM uses to keep the players committed to the story, like Exalted), you'll want to design the adventure as an <i>encounter string</i>: linear, but instead of presenting a sequential narrative, you present a number of conceptually related combat encounters. I recommend keeping the in-between fluff to a minimum, it's better to leave that up to the GM and the players to riff, unless the game is trying to do Big Story simultaneously with the Big Fights. D&amp;D 4th edition has fair (boring as fuck unless you're committed to the minis chess, of course) examples of how to write these types of adventures.<br/><b>*</b> If the game has a heavy emphasis on the characters as opposed to the story or challenge - for instance a Narrativist or Simulationist drama adventure game - the adventure format you probably want is the <i>story seed</i> or similar Bang-oriented thing: instead of writing up an adventure plot, you merely provide whatever setting information might be useful, and start things off with a provocative starting point, plus maybe some ideas for complications that may or may not be introduced by the GM later (the "bandolier of bangs", as it used to be called). The play group then takes it from there to wherever they might be going. <i>Ars Magica</i> largely runs off this sort of thing, as do many Forgite adventure games like <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> or <i>Dead of Night</i> and so on.<br/><br/>There may be one or two other prominent formats, but those are the most popular, I think, for adventure games specifically. (There are other ways to deliver session prep for games that do not follow an adventure structure, but that's not relevant here.) The trick is to write appropriately for your game; one particular pet peeve I have with the rpg text tradition is that everybody always blindly writes story hour -type adventures regardless of what they think or say their game to be about; it's just lazy, and reeks of control-maniac GMing, and does very little to actually help a GM run the game correctly when the adventure text itself encourages them to think in terms of linear plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458740/#Comment_458740" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-17T19:19:56+00:00" title="December 17, 2016  7:19PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2016 10:13PM by phoenix182.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like most things, there is no 'best way', only what works best for the individual (and within your framework, warrants and paradigms). <br/><br/>I've known people that do fine with a few 3x5's and post-its that they jotted notes on randomly. Conversely I tend to write about as much as you'd find in a published TSR campaign setting, complete with maps and tables and such (and sometimes an introductory novella to set the mood and give common reference). Either way can be equally fun.<br/><br/>It's all VERY subjective and depends on a hundred different qualifiers: what game, what setting, what people, what purpose, what style of play, what kind of DM, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458741/#Comment_458741" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-17T19:42:04+00:00" title="December 17, 2016  7:42PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was reading a book on writing <a href="https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/write-character-arcs/#" rel="nofollow">Character Arcs </a> its quite light and makes a lot of sense.<br/>But how it might apply to Adventure design is this,,, is the link between character Arcs and story Structure. <br/>or<br/>Adventure Design.<br/><br/>The two are linked and explained quite clearly in the book.<br/><br/>I would suggest checking it out for ideas. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458743/#Comment_458743" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-17T20:12:51+00:00" title="December 17, 2016  8:12PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Writing advice" is often difficult - and sometimes completely counter-productive! - to designing interactive entertainment like an RPG.<br/><br/>Eero covers the common variations pretty well, above.

One of the best adventures I ever wrote started with only a title. I was dying to run an adventure entitled "On Her Majesty's Dating Service."  That idea cracked me up. So I wrote a session around that title. Other times I've brainstormed/researched large collections of NPCs/Locations/Items/Events to fit a particular theme or genre and then tried to figure out how they'd relate to each other and the PCs. <br/><br/>You might want to check out Phil Vecchione's Never Unprepared: The Complete Game Master's Guide to Session Prep.
