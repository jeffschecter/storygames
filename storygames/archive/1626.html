<p>OK, over in the Least Favorite Jargon thread, I said that <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1579&amp;page=1#Item_64" rel="nofollow">the Creative Agendas are mutually exclusive</a>. Brand pointed out the CA Hybrid:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<h4>Hybrid</h4>
<p>Play which combines two or more Creative Agendas. Observed functional hybrids to date include only two rather than all three, and one of the agendas is apparently primary or dominant, with the other playing a supportive role. See my review of The Riddle of Steel.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, I haven't played Riddle of Steel, though I've owned it for a good long time. But this is what Ron says in his review of RoS:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>The Riddle of Steel includes multiple text pieces regarding the thematic drive of the game, which I have paraphrased to the Premise: "What is worth killing for?" It also includes a tremendously detailed, in-game-causal combat system. My call is that we are looking at Narrativist-Simulationist hybrid design, with the latter in a distinctly subordinate/supportive role. This is a scary and difficult thing to do.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The first game to try it was RuneQuest. [It didn't work.]</p>
<p>Now, I can see where Sim play might be marginally compatible with Narr play if I really stretch my mind. But also notice that the presence of two Agendas means that one of them is of much reduced importance. That means that, if I'm going for Narr play and am uninterested in the Sim aspects of the system, I'll be a little annoyed, and maybe it's little enough that I'm still having a good time doing what I want to do. But if I'm looking for a Sim experience, I'll be really frustrated by this other stuff on my sheet that matters a lot. I want Renaissance tropes, not challenging philosophical stances. Because, as Ron says,</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>In The Riddle of Steel, these elements of design aim unerringly toward one thing: the character as a philosophical statement...</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, if I want Renaissance combat tropes <em>and</em> philosophical statements about violence, I'll be happiest with this game. But I think it's important to note that the presence of a particular CA at the very least reduces another CA in importance dramatically.</p>
<p>I think it's also important to note that TRoS doesn't go about this lightly. Those CAs aren't mashed together lightheartedly. I have enough faith in the game that I wager that where the CAs would clash in their design, the technique favoring the relevant CA is the only one remaining in the design.</p>

<p>I believe hybrids are always */Sim, because of conflicts of interest between Gam and Nar. See, there's a split between Gam/Nar on the one hand and Sim on the other, based on whether the focus of play is on the interaction between the real people around the table (Gam/Nar) or on the evolution of the fiction (Sim.) You can get away with */Sim hybrids by having mode shifts: everyone plays Sim, Sim, Sim, and then suddenly Gam or Nar for a bit, then back to Sim.</p>
<p>However, when you switch from impersonal interaction (Sim) to personal interaction (Gam/Nar,) players are going to play the kind of personal interaction they prefer, Gam or Nar, regardless of what the other players are playing. It can still work, if the Gam external challenge mirrors the Nar moral challenge in some way. If it doesn't, the Gam players are aiming for something completely different than the Nar players, and there's a conflict.</p>
<p>Of course, even */Sim hybrids can have agenda conflicts, depending on player tolerance levels for personal interaction. If you have a Nar player who also likes Sim alongside a straight Sim player who really just wants to daydream about Star Trek or LotR and doesn't want to hear interjected moral commentary, or even a player who occasionally likes Nar, but doesn't feel like it tonight, that Nar/Sim hybrid is going to lead to a conflict.</p>

                            I will second Tony's statement about his play of Capes.  Of course that is, I think, because the design of Capes is so that the most effective way to win/compete is also tied directly to the thematic statements being made in the game.  I'll bet in other games where the design isn't quite so tight that I could tell which agenda Tony was pursuing but I'll have to wait and see if that is true.  Thus far I've only played Capes, DitV, and Jungle Speed with him.                        </div>

<p>Possibly not. I'm not a <em>Capes</em> player, although I may have to pick up the game soon (because I want to steal something from you, but that's a different matter.) And, I've never played with you, either. So I can't really say for sure if <em>Capes</em> is that rare chimera, the Gam/Nar hybrid, or whether it's just an artifact of your particular approach to Gam/Nar.</p>
<p>I'll say one thing, though: in a way, I think Gam and Nar are really the same thing, people putting their guts on the line to face a challenge, but in different arenas. Explicit game-world challenges (Gam) and implicit moral challenges (Nar). So, if a Gam/Nar hybrid is possible, it would be done by creating explicit challenges that have mirrored implicit challenges, which means that the Gam player's addressing of challenge is going to look like Nar to the Nar player, and vice versa.</p>

                            This is a naive question, so please be kind: can't any game be a hybrid if it compartmentalizes its creative agendas into different phases of the game that have limited interaction? A (non-role) game that occurs to me along these lines is Diplomacy which is primarily "Gamist" in that players attempt constrained tactical activity in order to "win", and secondarily "Narrativist" in that players employ more or less "in-character" discourse to negotiate tactical activity with one another, and quite often the process of that discourse has a greater effect on tactical activity than the other way around? The tension and balance between these two agendas is maintained by the separation of order writing phases, resolution phases, and negotiation phases, with order writing done secretly.<br><br>In the role-game field, doesn't Burning Wheel attempt this same tension and balance in its extended conflict mechanics where the conflict-driven narration of the story is abutted to a gamist "secret-order" tatical exercise to resolve activity (and "win")?                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Really, Tony? When you're playing Capes, it's Tony vs. Joshua, not Captain Pancake vs. The Smear?</blockquote>
In my experience with Capes, I can see that play could in fact have elements of both. The separate existence of player reward mechanics and character reward mechanics, and the allowance of Tony to play "his" character and "other" characters (both in the furtherance of player reward achievement), would support slipping back and forth between these two modes of play, no?<br/><br/>Sometimes, Tony does actions that are "not necessaily in the best interest" of Captain Pancake, because he's trying to finesse the system to put him in a better position to reward himself and put him in a better position. Sometimes, Tony does actions that are, or are not, in the best interest of Captain Pancake, because he's trying to make decisions that are "better for the ongoing narrative". And sometimes, Tony does actions that are more focussed on "what I-as-Captain-Pancake would rightly do in this situation". (All these are hypothetical situations and not attempts to <i>actually</i> describe what Tony may, or may not, do when playing Capes.)                        </div>

                            A gaggle of bullet points, which you may or may not agree with, of course:<br/>
<br/>
* You can't really identify CA except over a long period of observation. Just like you can't really tell why anyone does any activity, or what they get out of any activity, from moment-to-moment observation. <br/>
<br/>
* I envision CA as a continuum, rather than as individual states. The states are more like Platonic ideals. Therefore, hybrid play isn't really hybrid at all, so much as accomodating of a wider range of points on the continuum.<br/>
<br/>
* Talking about CA in an individual context without taking into account a group context is almost entirely useless. I bet you I could tell the difference between you playing Capes purely to support your Gamist desires at a table where everyone else has a strong Narrativist agenda.<br/>
<br/>
* Because they have most to do with the real person's motives and desires, Gamist and Narrativist play actually look very similar to each other most of the time. The trick to spotting either is in the payoff, which will affect the kinds of choices made. Gamist payoffs have to do with self-esteem and acknowledgement, and so will generally revolve around making difficult choices less difficult through the application of system strategy (and I'm using system in a Lumpley sense, so not just textual rules). Narrativist payoffs have to do with investment in the themes generated by play, and so will generally revolve in creating a situation that's somehow arresting to the player regardless of its "wisdom" from a strategic perspective.<br/>
<br/>
* Games that tie in good rules strategy with theme-making can make it slightly harder to suss out the difference. I'd put Capes in that category. I believe I've observed Gamist play of Fate, where the player created a self-goal of always having more fate points than everyone else, and eventually started pointing that fact out when no one really acknowledged him as being a rockstar for the achievement. The other players were cool with how much drama dude was making, and so, tolerated this behavior for as long as the game lasted. But, I'll note, that game isn't still going on.                        </div>

I haven't played enough good narativism yet to have internalized how the payoff appears, though one of the players comments after the first Dogs in the Vinyard games I ran "this is just like a soap opera" is getting close to identifying the payoff (in this case, I don't think the player was celebrating the payoff, but rather had an insight to what the payoff might be - interesting coming from the most communication challenged player I've ever played with). A simulationist payoff celebration might look like: "Dude, that was so perfect, just like the book!"<br/><br/>I'm not quite so sure about the continuum bit though. So far, I think the CAs really are separate. I suspect if it looks like play is hybrid, what's really going on is CA incoherence. Which may be just fine, because there may be a more important agenda in place (for example, social agenda "we want to be WITH each other" can override creative agenda). It's also possible for the system (rules and procedures) to minimize the friction between CAs, but at some point, I think the incoherence will jump out.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

I guess it depends on how you define it when everyone gets their payoff to whatever degree they're satisfied with. I see incoherence as being that point where everyone's CA (and hence, the group CA) is so compromised that no one is getting their payoff. But I also believe there can be spaces in the middle where, if your Gamist play creates output that's true to the setting/color/etc., I'm glad to call you a rockstar, and you're glad to let me dream.<br/>
<br/>
Why do I think this works? Because nearly (big qualifier, don't cite me Universalis and PTA as a counter) all gaming has moments of theme-creation, moments of stepping up, and moments of dreaming. Everyone does it all. That's not the issue. The issue is, what part of that really turns you on? And then, how does your getting turned on by it affect everyone else who's in the room? And, yeah, that is a primarily social question, because CA is one *expression* of social agenda.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, if we're a metal band, and you're playing jazz solos, it's going to mess me up even if you're good. If you're playing metal solos... kudos, man. You go with your metal self. Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            But Tony, is that Hybrid play, or is it CA Congruence?  Which is to say, Tony, is that a part of <i>your</i> play (Congruence), or is it a part of the design of Capes (Hybrid)?  (Definitions quoted here for thread reference)  --  I've always seen Hybrid used to describe specific games, although the definition doesn't seem to agree with that usage.
<blockquote><cite>the Forge Provisional Glossary</cite><br/>Congruence<br/><br/>    Play in which two or more different Creative Agendas may be expressed in such a way that they neither interfere with one another nor are easily distinguished through observation. The term was coined by Walt Freitag in GNS and "Congruency". A controversial topic.<br/><br/><br/>Hybrid<br/><br/>    Play which combines two or more Creative Agendas. Observed functional hybrids to date include only two rather than all three, and one of the agendas is apparently primary or dominant, with the other playing a supportive role. See my review of The Riddle of Steel.</blockquote>
It seems to me that a Gam/Nar combination would be much easier to achieve because Sim lacks a concrete goal.  To have both GN, all you need to do is make the address of Premise a desirable strategic choice (or better, make all of your strategic choices ways to address premise) and you're there.                        </div>

                            *Wait*. Before we keep going, I'm afraid I'm going to be that dude who nitpicks about jargon.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Glossary, games do not have creative agendas. They only provide differing levels of support for creative agendas. Therefore, designs that support multiple agendas are not hybrids by themselves. So, those designs don't comment on the presence or absence of hybrid play, period. Please, pretty please, let's not get tangled in that while we're doing so well with this topic. I'm pretty sure everyone's aware of the shorthand, but I think there's a potential for more than a semantical difference in the discussion. If jargon sucks, it sucks worse when no two people are using it the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Having a design that makes the address of premise sync up with good system strategy doesn't mean you have a Gam/Nar hybrid, because the bottom line is what *you* get out of it, is *play*. Using activities that are normally the ends of one agenda as a means to achieve another is not hybrid play, it's normal play. Being a rockstar means you have to address some premise along the way? You're still playing Gamist. Addressing premise means you get in situations where you have to use the system well? You're still playing Narrativist. <br/>
<br/>
Again... most gaming does all the activities that support every agenda. CA is identified by what the participants emphasize, from within the confines of those activities, as the long-term reason for playing.<br/>
<br/>
If we're going to get anywhere with Joshua's original post and Tony's reply, we have to talk about what goes on solely in that context. Honestly. Or we're just going to start talking past one another.<br/>
<br/>
So, where *do* these things come in? If Tony's right that you can't tell if two people at the same Capes table are playing Nar or Gam, and that's a long-term, sustainable thing, and they don't screw up each other's fun, that's what the Forge glossary calls congruent play. If Tony can somehow get equal Nar and Gam payoffs from Capes in the same unit of play, without saying that he uses one as a means to achieve the payoff from the other, that's hybrid play.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion? In the right social climate, congruence can definitely exist. And everyone I've seen who claims to play hybrid is, IMO, mistaking hybrid play for the abovementioned "means to an end" thing.                        </div>

This sounds sensible and is in accord to how I first envisioned "creative agendas"; that is, I can see that it's useful to think of them as representing tendencies rather than concrete states.                        </div>

                            Tony: Not trying to be snarky, but I'd direct you to your own advice about looking at what I've said, very carefully. There are a generous amount of qualifiers in my posts, including the twice-repeated use of the word "if" when your name came up, precisely because I'm not making any assumptions. I'm talking about keeping straight with the terms if we, meaning everyone on this thread, are going to use them as shared language to try and get somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm all about you telling me what's going on with your play of Capes (personal and observed) as it relates to the topic at hand. So far, you've made alternate, vague suggestions that either a.) you play hybrid or b.) Capes supports congruent CA's for different folks, underneath an umbrella of c.) neither of the two terms are really helpful in explaining what actually goes on.<br/>
<br/>
So, cool. I'm willing to accept all that at face value, if that's what you're asserting. Given that, I'd be interested in some of the details, and I think they'd be helpful for the thread.                        </div>

Aha! I see where we might be confusing each other now. No, I wouldn't define that as hybrid play as per the Provisional Glossary, because what you're calling the "payoff" (earning story tokens or creating theme) in the quoted post isn't, by definition as I understand it, a fulfillment of a CA.<br/><br/>The fact that you try to earn story tokens does not mean you're playing Gamist, and the fact that you try to create theme doesn't mean you're playing Narrativist, because neither of those actions tell me anything about what you actually get, viscerally, out of doing those things, with *why* you're doing them. What does Tony get out of playing Capes? Where does the rush come from? What's the source of reward, emotionally, personally? In that context, the rules-based currency doesn't really mean much, because techniques support CA's, but don't lead to them.<br/><br/>When you look back, over a long period, is it the recognition or esteem you get/feel from your performance with the system that jazzes you out, or is it your internal response to gut-wrenching moments of hard choice and pathos? Or is it different at different times? If so, when is it different? Does it depend on whom you play with? How does that difference feed into your interactions with the other players?<br/><br/>Or, do you even know? That isn't a flip or snarky question - some people don't really care to self-examine a satisfying experience overmuch. Sometimes, doing so is the quickest route to sabotaging everything about it that was cool.<br/><br/>Does that make more sense?                        </div>

And when you eat a good apple pie, Landon, do you like the crust or the filling?  Is it the appley goodness or the spicy zing that you prefer?  Do you like the crust's flakiness or its chewiness?

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Do you see how asking the question in this way<i>presupposes</i>that I'm not talking about a hybrid?</blockquote>
Did you notice that my second sentence was, "No, I wouldn't define what you just stated as hybrid play?"<br/><br/>So, yeah. To me, you're weren't talking about hybrid play. Moreover, you weren't, to me, talking about CA at all. You were talking about what the mechanics of Capes do. That doesn't tell me anything about your CA, regardless of whether you know what CA fulfillment is or not. I'm looking at the words that are there, not the spaces between them.<br/><br/>But, again, I take your self-analysis at face value.<br/><br/>So, now, lemme ask you this. Do you think that when you play Capes with other people, that they can have strong, differing Nar, Gam, or hybrid agenda, and that the system pretty much keeps those different agendas from coming into conflict? And if so, why? Do the mechanical rewards just line up that well with the social ones? Have you ever seen an instance of conflict in this regard, or has it all remained pretty much invisible during play?                        </div>

When I eat apple pie, I do at home, with guests, to show off my silverware.  Because, see, I don't give a damn about apple pie.  Apple pie is food; food is something you eat so you won't die.<br/><br/>But my silverware is ironwork, each piece is unique, and they're fucking cool as hell.<br/><br/>You're in this for the pie.  That's your goal.  The silverware is just a tool you eat it with.<br/><br/>I'm in this to show you my silverware.  That's my goal.  The pie is just a tool I use to show it off to you, because people look at my funny when I just show them my cool damn silverware, and that's no fun.<br/><br/>...So here we are, eating pie.<br/><br/>The question is, can you make a pie that will improve my silverware-showing experience?<br/><br/>Can I lay the table so as to improve your pie-eating?<br/><br/>Can we create a silverware-and-pie experince in which we both rock?<br/><br/>I think that we can.                        </div>

                            I'm feeling rant-y.<br/><br/>I think the analogies aren't helping the situation. If we're going to get to the bottom of a CA-type discussion, we need to dicuss actual real play. Discussing how we think things work won't help us. We need to dicuss our actual real experiences.<br/><br/>Tony, I'm not here to question your assertion that you experience hybrid/congruent/whatever-you-want-to-call-it play. But I agree with Landon---the way you're describing your experience seems to be in terms of mechanics, which doesn't address the issues of CA payoff.<br/><br/>Could you try discussing the payoff without bringing mechanics into the discussion? You mention that you take the same actions to receive both Gam and Nar payoffs. But what is that payoff? Do you see what I'm asking?<br/><br/>The issue of hybrid/congruent/whatever is a fascinating one, and I (and I'm sure others) would love to hear more about your experience.                        </div>

You could.   <br/><br/>And that's my problem with CA, as written, as well.  Not that the agendas don't exist, but that it's often more complex than that.                        </div>

I'll try to explain how it feels, absent the particulars.  You're going to have to take my word on a <i>lot</i> of this, or else we're going to get pulled right back down into the particulars again.<br/><br/>When I play I am unfailingly aware of a few specific things.  I know what moral principles I am ready to stand for.  I know what game resources I have on hand.  These are the same thing, shown two different ways.<br/><br/>I know what moral principles other people are ready to stand for.  I know what game resources they have on hand.  These are the same thing, shown two different ways.<br/><br/>I know how those things can come into conflict.  I know what opportunities I have to engage the other people in skilled game-play.  Same thing.<br/><br/>I know all these things because the system attaches many flags to them, and waves those flags in front of my face.  The system rewards me for paying attention to these things, and for manipulating them skillfully (which is to say both addressing the premises in a genuine and powerful manner and playing the game in a skillful and daring manner, because those are the same thing).<br/><br/>When I've played for many sessions, I can look at the rewards I've accrued, and say of them both "Wow, I really hit that premise square on the head," and "Wow, I really outplayed the other guys, took a big risk and made it pay off."  Those are the same thing in this context ... addressing premise is how I take that risk, and taking that risk is how I address premise.  Other people see the same thing, and give me social feedback on it.  I rock!<br/><br/>The rewards can be plowed back into the game in many ways.  I <i>could</i> use them to build the world, or to explore the dream, or whatever.  But inevitably what I <b>do</b> use them for is to set myself up to champion moral principles that will let me get an advantage over other players (which is the same as saying that I set myself up to engage in tactical conflicts that will help me force the other players to stand for their ideals ... remember, it's all inextricably the same thing).  That's what I'm always going to plug my rewards back into, because that is what I'm playing the game in order to do more of.<br/><br/>Does that help at all?  I know it was an awful lot of "These two things are the same thing," but I'm beginning to think that bear <i>a lot</i> of repeating.                        </div>

<div class="Message">
                            Here's my Actual Play-ish experience, from tonight/recent days, with a HUGE CA gap:<br/><br/>Me: The Indie Nar git-yer-story-on-freak<br/>Beth: "Whatever, I like to hang out with friends, I'm not too into hard rules. Also, I've never GMed before but I want to in the next extended campaign."<br/>Jeremie: "I love to roleplay, I can play with hard rules but prefer lighter rules"<br/>Mark: "I like lighter rules. I also want to GM soon, but prefer a rules set that's lighter, for my first time and all."<br/><br/>All of the above: We don't mind playing long term or short term games. We all enjoy both.<br/><br/>... <br/><br/>ok, with me so far?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Alan: "I don't like games without realistic skill progressions (Botany, Zoology, etc instead of just "Biology"), a clear advancement system and realistic combat options: Rules for explosions, etc. I think games with player input mechanics like Fate/Wild dice are "broken", and that the rules for the players should apply to all NPCs too. And rules for story change/input are 'gimmicky' . I enjoy long term games where characters grow slowly over time. I prefer percentile systems."<br/><br/>So yeah, the rest of us are really beating our heads, especially because:<br/><br/>1: Alan is one of the other folks who runs as GM a lot, when I'm not doing it.<br/>2: We decided that we wanted to engage in a campaign for "a year", using one system (perhaps with intermidiary one-shots for "side stories" in the shared SF universe that we will create.<br/>3: Alan is one of the core members of the group, and we all meet up as friends to game, not to game first and do friend-stuff second.<br/><br/>That is a real, no-jerking-around no-abstraction, creative agenda mishmash issue. If this was a hardcore gaming group, we'd just part ways. But this is a weekly "friend chat and gaming group", which means that our overall agenda is simply to hang out. But we still agree that we don't JUST want to hang out, or hang out and play board games; we do want to play roleplaying games.<br/><br/>So, the issue we're in the middle of right now is basically living with all the above mess. We have decided to get a little more hardcore into gaming, in that whatever game we decide to play for 6+ months or whatever we will ALL buy the core book for. But we're looking at a situation where for the next 3 weeks or so we will be trying out various gaming rules sets, and deciding which ones will be best for the group.<br/><br/>For now, my idea that I've shared is "Let's let Alan pick the game we play": The reason is we've been playing TSOY, Unknown Armies, d20, Sorcerer, Star Wars d6, PTA, and a few hippie one-shots for the past 4 years or so. If Alan picks the game we play, then we get to satisfy his agenda, and give him as close to a "full stomach" as possible for a while. However, in the rules sets we've looked at, there hasn't been a system that we've found that really does everything that Alan's looking for: Savage Worlds' skill system isn't "realistic enough" (though the other players liked the system overall); HERO is too much work; ICAR isn't baked enough; Fading Suns is too specific to the setting; Blue Planet 1st edition is good, but 2nd edition (non-percentile) doesn't have a lot of combat options and the like, and both are Extremely hard to find online even on eBay; d6 is played out in our group, and 'the skills make it so that there is little differentiation between characters"; We're even looking at GURPS/GURPS Lite, but I'm not all up for that (Lite is ok, but chargen is too involved and boring) and Alan hasn't heard good things about it.  <br/><br/>It's feeling like we're trying to feed a fussy baby, and I'm sure that there's gonna be some capitulation involved, but right now it feels like we're riding a 67 Chevy down the Creative Agenda Mismatch Highway to Hell.<br/><br/>We've taken some solid steps to working it out, but even clarifying the situation has brought some solid, untenable issues into focus. Before we could simply play without thinking about it too much. Now that we're getting deeper into gaming and thinking about it more, the incongruencies are starting to stick out like sore thumbs.<br/><br/>So, that kinda shows hopefully what a real Creative Agenda difference looks like, and how other factors (friendship, hanging out; and these are higher goals, even; Perhaps "Hanging Out" is the Hidden Fourth Adjunct to GNS) can muddy the waters from a simple draconian "Oh, then you should stop playing" viewpoint.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Thanks Tony.<br/><br/>This got me thinking about my own experience, which isn't meant as a direct comparison: Does <i>The Mountain Witch</i> support congruent play? The answer isn't so easy.<br/><br/>Overtime, I've noticed a certain style of play, which I've come to recognize as Gamist play of tMW. The players are all very supportive of each, and are very focused on getting through the Mission. They foreshadow their Fate and stuff, and reveal them in good time. Overall, these players try and maintain the moral high ground. Then, at the end of the game, after killing the Witch, they very often turn on each other.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing---this is obviously Gamist play. However, it's still a valid means by which to address Premise. I don't consider it the most interesting way to address Premise, but it's valid. Regular Nar players don't mind this style of play, it fits in fine. I'm not sure if the Gam players get annoyed with the Nar players. I haven't had any issues with that, but that doesn't mean it's not possible.<br/><br/>At first glance these Gamist players seem like regular old tMW players. In fact, it was only after I saw this style repeated a couple times did I realize what was going on. So does tMW support congruent play?
<blockquote><b>Congruence</b><br/><br/>Play in which two or more different Creative Agendas may be expressed in such a way that they neither interfere with one another nor are easily distinguished through observation.</blockquote>
[edit] <i>I'll provide a little commentary---even though Gamist tMW players can co-exist peacefully with Nar players, their options or strategies are limited. So it's not a perfect example.</i> [/edit]                        </div>

                            And I'll add another data point---Despite Ron's review of tRoS, it is my understanding that over time he's become less inclined to accept the idea of hybrid play. I believe his current view of (the Old) tRoS is that it's primary Nar-facilitating. <br/><br/>But it's been awhile since I've been apart of this type of discussion. I don't know what his current position on hybrid &amp; congruent play is in regard to the current crop of games like Capes.                        </div>

                            Tim, <br/><br/>How much of that particular gamist response do you think is due to the traditional double punch of team play in American culture and RPG culture? <br/><br/>Because counldn't it be just as equally a gamist response to try and go for the fulfillment of your fate (KILL THE EVIL BASTARD WHO DID BAD THINGS TO YOUR FAMILY! NOW!) before the Witch at the most opportune moment for personal reasons? <br/><br/>The Step On Up issue you're seeing in game obviously has something to do with the "we must defeate the external threat as a team then follow individual issues" as an assumed ideal outcome. But that outcome isn't always a universal assumed, and the guy with the guts to step up and murder another PC at the cost of the mission could reap some respect in groups with a different assumption -- esepcially if no one saw it coming. <br/><br/>Or, to put this another way, I think that the reason the gamists you're seeing have fewer options open is that they've already made a big assumption about their address of premise -- their response to the issue of trust is "of course we trust each other enough to do the mission, we're a team, personal shit comes after." And so long as that response is the assumed for folks going for the game angle, the options remain limited.                        </div>

I'm gonna end up trying to murder my fellow player.  That means I have to sucker him into trusting me.  It'd be cool if my character <i>didn't yet know</i> that this was the guy he'd sworn vengeance on.  Then I could be all sincere and friendly for a while, and only find out about my need to stick a katana in his liver later, when we'd already built up huge, mutual trust.  Plot Twist = Advantage Tony!"<br/><br/>I think there are lots of gamist strats for Mountain Witch that would end up being identical with addressing premise (though I also agree that there's plenty of possibility for the two to diverge).                        </div>

                            Okay, Tony and Landon got me thinking about something about my own play over years. This goes both as a player and as GM, and gets into the areas where I become unclear about some CA talk. <br/><br/>In Step On Up the primary motivation is the recognition of your peers for the guts, skill, and planning it took to pull off the amazing thing you just did, right? <br/><br/>In Address of Premise the primary motivation is the ability to build a strong protagonist who creates theme through powerfully addressing premise, right? <br/><br/>So, when I play one of the big reasons I go for hard-core address of premise is to make the other people at the table step back and go "OH SHIT I DON'T BELIEVE HE JUST DID THAT! THAT WAS FUCKING HARDCORE SHIT!" <br/><br/>Now, I don't usually do this through mechanical or game-strategy bits. I do this through an understanding of narrative structure and an epicaric virago willingness to screw my characters into the blackest spots the human mind can imagine. I also do it because I love to make stories that have meaning through strategies like that. <br/><br/>But at one and the same time I'm doing it for personal reasons (building a story around a protagonist I find to be a satisfying address) and to make everyone else in the group step back and give me my due for being awesome, facing huge risk, and showing guts and narrative mastery. <br/><br/>So, most of the time I wouldn't think much about this. I'm just a Narrativist who gets off on the recognition of others at the table, and has a certain in-the-face way of going about it, right? But then someone on the Forge recently made a post that I found quite interesting. He (sorry that I don't name the poster, I don't remember) suggested that a lot of LARP and freeform games are actually quite gamist in their approach -- but the thing being gamed is the social situation at the party, rather than the mechanical structures of the game. This fell in line with Emily and Christian's recent posts about freeform RPG and how social respect is the big reward cycle. <br/><br/>Now I'm left in this place: I don't think what I'm describing is hybrid play. I think I'm doing Nar, but I think that I've got some very step up elements to the way I approach Nar because to me it really doesn't matter how awesome my address is unless my address forces reaction and respect from the other players at the table in a manner pretty much identical to the social response from a full Step Up in a Gamist context. So while I'm really doing one, and not both, I think it shows how murky CAs can get when you try to boil them down far enough into your own play. <br/><br/>I also think it shows how past history of RP can condition you. I was playing in LARP and freeform MUSHes for years as my predominant mode, and the only way for me to get the power to address premise was to get the social reconition power into the reward loop. Once people knew my shit was awesome, they'd let me do what I wanted so long as I kept producing the awesome. Thus the ability to address premise and the ability to impress people with my bad-assness came to be pretty tightly wound in my head. <br/><br/>In contrast Mo often wants to address premise, but cares a lot less about the impact it has on other players. Of course she wants to entertain everyone and make them happy with her contributions, but there is a different level to our resposnes to it. When she gets her address and everyone just nods, she's okay with it. If I get the best address in the universe and get no sounds of awe and amazement, I'm not happy. <br/><br/>(Note: I don't diss CAs in total, I think that as a loose barametric they can be useful, just that when you ratchet them down too tight they're less usefull. This is just one of the areas where I'm finding a mild disconnect in my brain about what other people are saying.)                        </div>

                            Um, if someone does a powerful, meaningful job of addressing premise, of course it's going to garner respect among others. <br/><br/>This does not equate with Step On Up. Gamism is not the only agenda that captures social respect. <br/><br/>Similarly, Gamism holds no monopoly on clever use of mechanics.<br/><br/>My reading of much of this thread is people seeing social respect and thinking "Hey, Gamism!" It's not. It's Narrativism. Similarly, people saying "I use strategy all the time, and my stories rock for it, so it's Gamism, too!"  No, it's not. It's Narrativism. <br/><br/>This occurs often in Nine Worlds, for example. People make astounding use of Muses, cleverly, and garner much higher rewards than their peers. This is Narrativism, no question in my mind. People get all jazzed about how points are flying around, and the cool Muse trick so-and-so did. I shrug and say "Yep. Way to go. You <i>cleverly</i> addressed premise, points and all, but you're still addressing premise. We all admire you. Still no Step On Up. Nice addressing, though!"                        </div>

                            Brand and Tony---yes, I can see other ways to fullfil Gamist desires in tMW other than what I mentioned. They are just harder to identify. The pattern I mentioned, for whatever reason, is just one I see alot.<br/><br/>One of the main tells I see of Gamist players is their uninterest in moral issues. This is part of the "they take the moral high ground." I try to press them with moral stuff, like I try to convince them that the Witch isn't so bad. And it kinda just falls flat. Hardcore nar players love stewing in that shit, even if they're playing a real straight-edge sorta character. This is a real subtle thing, it's not a game-breaking thing as it might sound. It's one of those things I notice mainly due to the large amount of tMW play I've done with so many different people.<br/><br/>Because of this reluctence is why I think their options are "more limited". But that doesn't mean they don't have choices.<br/><br/>Brand,<br/><br/>I use to think Nar and Gam were very simliar, but I'm less inclined to say that now. I think the thing people forget is that ALL role-playing is about social feedback. It's in Sim too, even if it's less intense. I believe it's a function of social contract, not CA. So I think it's a red herring to look at the cheering and stuff. You need to look at why people are cheering.<br/><br/>IME, the difference is that Gamist cheering is a celebration of what they, as players, accomplished. The focus is on them. The cheering in Nar play (again, IME) is about the *content of the fiction*. Is the (subtle) difference apparent? Superficially, they are similar, but (IME) there's real qualitative difference.<br/><br/>I think maybe this was what Joshua Newman was trying to get at with the "Tony vs Joshua &amp; Sgt. Hero vs Dr Evil"                        </div>

                            Tim, <br/><br/>I'm following you, and I think you've got me most of the way there. I'm not fully sure on the difference between cheering the content of the fiction and cheering what the player has accomplished. <br/><br/>Or that is, I'm clear on the difference and how it works that way for lots of people. I'm less clear on if its the divide that is going to fit me into one or the other. Because the cheering I'm talking about isn't just cheering for what has happened in the ficiton, it is an acknowledgement of what I have created. Its like the difference between "wow that was a good story" and "wow, you are a good writer!" Right? Well, I'm usually looking towards the second. That I can only get it by going through the first is fine, but the "wow, good story" isn't what I'm looking for. I'm looking for "that only you Brand, could have pulled off." <br/><br/>Matt, <br/><br/>I'm going to bring you in now, as I think there is something you're talking about that you aren't actually saying, and I think it ties in with what Tim is telling me. When is it that you Step On Up? You've said, pretty much, "Well, you're addressing premise so you aren't Stepping Up" which is fine -- but when does the focus shift? Like in Tim's example of Gamist MW players, he knows the focus has shifted when the moral issues don't hold weight anymore. <br/><br/>So what is it that makes striving for all the aspects of what you get from Step on Up not Step on Up when you're playing a game? Is it just because they aren't primary? Because you aren't using the system to overcome tactical challanges? <br/><br/>What? <br/><br/>Tim, <br/><br/>Same quesiton -- what is this thing that we are celebrating the characters for accomplishing in Step on Up?                        </div>

I'm reading his posts and thinking "yeah!"<br/><br/>I'm not the best person to communicate this question. I turn to the "It's like pornography -- you know it when you see it" line. <br/><br/>You Step On Up when you recognize among game participants enthusiasm about tactical and strategic choices irrespective of whether they address moral issues or not. Discerning whether people are jazzed about strategy or moral issues SOUNDS hard, but I don't believe in practice it's difficult at all. Too often, I read and participate in GNS-related discussions that circle post after post with "Yah-buts" and then we actually go to the table and think "Well, duh. Narrativism. This isn't rocket science. See how Mary just smiled when John revealed his character's revenge ploy? Neat." Or, "Man, did you see Dave high-five Alan for remembering that letter from the prince that got us in the castle. GM didn't know what to do! Awesome. Gamism."                        </div>

                            Brand, cool. I have no firm ideas regarding hybrid play. I'm skeptical. I don't recognize at all what Tony's doing. I don't know how Capes works very well, and I can't suss out its system from what little I do know. I suspect that either the system changes as Tony's strong personality moves it one direction or another, or that the system is really an assembly of techniques that each group then drifts sort of intuitively one way or another.

                            Over the past few months, reading various descriptions of Creative Agendas (CA), I've come to the conclusion that they are the <i>gestalt aesthetic</i> of the play group. The rest of this post will be based on that conclusion, so please take it with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>That means that, you cannot have multiple CAs in a group, because the CAs are a property of the group's actions. And it means, as a gestalt property the CA of a group is always in the process of becoming. <br/><br/>Congruence is not a permanent state, as decisions occurs, the CA clarifies further. Hybrid play presupposes that two (assumedly) conflicting CAs can existing in a single group, as though they were a single CA. But since the CA comes from what you all do, not what you believe, there ultimately is at most one CA. <br/><br/>Oddly, enough, this has nothing to do with any specific creative agendas. Time and time again, when I play with various groups I find ourselves building a shared sense of what is valuable, and what is not inside the game. Sometimes this does not come together, sometimes the aesthetic doesn't emerge. But the game is always better when it does. <br/><br/>Now the claim of GNS then is that only three classes of CAs are observed, namely: G, N, and S. But can there be others? Could you have a single CA, resembling both G and N? Quite possibly. But for it to be a gestalt aesthetic, it needs to be self-consistent, allowing the group to reliably value different aspects of play in the same way. From the sounds of things, that may describe what Tony does, although it would need to also be true of his group.<br/><br/>Perhaps, a game like Capes has different CAs than more traditional games. Many things become possible when you free Creative Agendas from GNS.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>

                            The reason the theory fora got shut down was discussions like this. I like Andy's explanation of his actual play. Skip the G and the N and the S in the discussion. You'll find that the idea of a creative agenda makes sense then.<br/>
<br/>
Just a bit of history, GNS modes were claimed to be mutually exclusive, because when people started saying that they weren't, suddenly it became pretty provable that it was impossible to identify mode of play, and the theory became useless. So the definition came to be that they were mutually exclusive, simply so that they could exist as a framework for discussion. Nobody claims that any CA is composed of activity that can 100% be attributed to one mode or another. Simply that, taken as a whole, the agenda can be identified as X or Y overall.<br/>
<br/>
That is, it's quite possible to say that agendas differ by the specifics, as Andy has done. Also, remember that mode is but one way of classifying a creative agenda, and the most gross. It's also suitable to talk about Creative Agendas in terms of the lower level elements like techniques used, and ephemera (again as Andy does).<br/>
<br/>
Basically if modes don't seem indicative of a problem or phenomenon, they probably aren't, and it may be something intra-modal, or at another level entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, a lot of this can be circumvented by pointing out that a text like TROS can only be said to be seen as promoting a particular CA. And that different players will probably interperet it differently. That is, there's not likely any one correct answer as to what TROS supports. At best you get like Ron's assertions that it seems to him to best support narrativism. Meaning, more than anything else, that when he plays it he sees narrativism play produced.<br/>
<br/>
Only actual play has an agenda. And nobody says that identifying the mode used there is always possible, either (Ron claims that it's usually discernable, but never says that it is 100%). Mostly it's important merely in discovering when there is a CA difference of some sort.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, there are positive aspects of study of modes, too, like figuring out things to do better if you understand the preferred mode. But where its unidentified, the theory does nothing, and doesn't claim to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
If that makes it seem somewhat unuseful to you, then you may see why the theory fora are closed at the Forge.<br/>
<br/>
Another concept that people are forgetting is that of mode shift. Though an "instance of play" can be identified with a CA, that doesn't mean that the next will always have the same mode. That's different from both hybrid play and congruence.<br/>

                            Mike, <br/><br/>Re: Andy's post. <br/><br/>I agree with what you're saying. But here is the little thing that I've never been able to stop chafin about. <br/><br/>Andy's post tells me very clearly that there are CAs and that sometimes CA clash can lead to conflict around the table. <br/><br/>It doesn't tell me anything at all about the G the N or the S. And you know what? It may well be a better post for it. <br/><br/>Which is why I love talk about CA, but get real hazy about the GNS thing except when it is used in the vaugest of directional terms. As... I dunno... karmic directions or individual points around which identified functional play has been built they seem useful in a moderate way, and make a good shorthand for a cluster of related ideas. But as a structure to build from.... <br/><br/>Of course, I have a feeling that complaints like that one are another reason the theory forums were closed down.                        </div>

                            Unsurprisingly, I'm in the same position as Brand.  I see G-N-and-S as identified <em>trends</em> -- in fact I prefer to think of them as umbrellas -- but I do not see them as discrete things in and of themselves with individual, coherent identities.  So while they are useful as approximations, I don't find them useful as definitions.                        </div>

Er, that's exactly what I was saying above.<br/>
<br/>
What makes the theory useless is if you say that there are three unmixed things going on all at once. At that point everybody's play is just "some mix," and you can't find where conflicts occur. By saying that play "pays attention" to one thing more than the others (prioritizes it, as Ron puts it), you can see where the conflicts may occur.<br/>
<br/>
Brand, so you're saying that you're disturbed because GNS isn't always important to the analysis of some play? You'll have to learn to get over that. People want GNS to somehow be the total analysis of play, when, in fact, it's only one small part of describing what's going on overall.<br/>
<br/>
Josh, El Nino is a trend that's well defined. You're right that they are trends in a way. What's prioritized in general. I don't see how that's problematic. Trends are the number one tool in analysis.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>By saying that play "pays attention" to one thing more than the others (prioritizes it, as Ron puts it), you can see where the conflicts may occur.</blockquote>Yes, but I'm not saying that play as a whole pays attention to things.  I'm just saying that individual players pay attention to one thing more than the others.  Which, y'know, doesn't tell you what is objectively happening at the gaming table but I'm okay with that.<br><br>To be fair, I shouldn't describe it as a version of GNS.  Perhaps a <b>per</b>version ... an idea I made by reassembling the pieces of GNS that I like along with some other stuff.  I'm good at making that distinction elsewhere, I should bear it in mind here.  Anyway, all in the link, and probably a digression anyway.  I guess I just don't see why people looked down that road, way back when, and said "Oh!  Nothing of value there!  So clearly we must say, by definition, that such things can't happen."                        </br></br></div>

And that's how I use them when I use them, Mike.  But trends are not mutually exclusive; they can coexist.  Especially when they're not the same thing affecting the same medium.  El Nino can coexist with a stock market fluctuation.  So too can a G-agenda coexist with an N-agenda, in the way I think of them.  A lot of GNS analysis boils down to, at some point, asking which way the wind is blowing in the game: was it going east or west, were you enjoying the applause of your peers or the development of the moral question?  And making it an either-or question assumes that the trends in question can't coexist.                        </div>

                            I've just bought Riddle of Steel (I like a lot of it, but wish it would stop harping on about how it's got the <i>most realistic combat system ever seen in an RPG</i> and dissing D&amp;D for being D&amp;D). Something Ron doesn't point out in his review is that not <i>only</i> does it contain several blocks of text which talk about the game's "Premise", it also contains quite a lot of sections where it talks about how the combat system is designed to rely on the <i>player's</i> strategic abilities, which is as close to a textbook definition of a Gamist CA as you can get.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly feel that when it comes to the Riddle of Steel the entire language of the Threefold is a giant red herring. The point isn't that it is "primarily simulationist with narrativist and gamist undertones" or "primarily Narrativist with Gamist and Simulationist undertones." The Riddle of Steel is about <i>combat</i> pure and simple. It is about combat on many, many levels. It is a combat wargame, a combat commentary, a combat simulation. It's about interacting with the idea of "combat" in as many ways as possible.                        </div>

I might be wrong, though, but isn't the problem that CA as it stands is pretty much *defined* in terms of GNS. The way terminology stands, "Creative Agenda" *means* "one of Gamism, Narrativism, or Simulationism". By strict reading of the Terminology, Andy's Actual Play example above might or might not be a technical-definition Creative Agenda conflict.<br/><br/>I'd *prefer* it if we actually *could* call it a CA conflict but as I understand it we can only do *that* if we can demonstrate that some of them wanted a "Narrativist" playstyle while others wanted a "Simulationist" one, which may or may not be true.<br/><br/>Or am I understanding the current state of the lexicon wrong?                        </div>

                            Consider this: modern GNS analogies hold that CA-X is as dissimilar to CA-Y as a guy who loves pigs as pets and a guy who eats them for lunch (or a guy who drives motorcycles and a guy who uses them for modern art surrounded by bronzed cabbages). If, in fact, they are as mutually exculsive and so *extraoridinarily* distinct then this shouldn't even be a viable conversation.<br/><br/>Andy's post, which is entirely comprehensible, shows a creative agenda clash. It doesn't show any clear kind of Creative Agend clash (that is, people's preferences are varried but not along the canonical GNS lines). I think that what GNS calls technique (and, IIRC, includes immersion therein) are very often first-order goals and therefore as severe a line of potential conflict as the three listed CA's.<br/><br/>Tony's experience with Capes is analgous to my experience with GURPS (along Nar-Sim divides) and I identify with his position here completely.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

I think that's probably true, but so long as "Creative Agenda" has an explicit meaning in the Terminology of the Big Model it will be held to that definition. You'll say "my group has creative agenda differences" and somebody will say "actually according to (link to essay) your group does not have creative agenda differences".
<blockquote>Certainly it's a shift away from old definitions, but the same thing has happened before with other issues (stances, frex) and so I don't think it would be all that hard of a thing to do. It'd just require that we actually be able to figure out what the real people at the table really want rather than having the (admitedly convenient) shorthand of typology.</blockquote>
The problem is that I think people now have a lot more vested interest in keeping the Terminology as it is. The Forge have closed their Theory forums, and it seems to have been declared that the Big Model For Talking About Roleplaying is complete. I think people are going to be very, very reluctant to accept that terms like "Force" and "Creative Agenda" could have meanings other than their "definitions".
<blockquote>Andy's post, above, is an example of this.</blockquote>
Andy's post is an excellent example of why it is useful to understand what the people around a table actually want out of a game, and why it is probably far more useful to do that than to talk in terms of specific terminology. That doesn't mean that the Terminology will be so easy to change though.                        </div>

The old terminology means what the old terminology means.  If you want to talk about something else, I figure you're in the realm of creating a new model ... which doesn't mean all new terminology, thank God.  We could, y'know, try to talk about it in english.  But redefining old terminology strikes me as the worst of both worlds.  It muddies communication both coming and going.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>Andy's post, which is entirely comprehensible, shows a creative agenda clash. It doesn't show any clear kind of Creative Agend clash (that is, people's preferences are varried but not along the canonical GNS lines). I think that what GNS calls technique (and, IIRC, includes immersion therein) are very often first-order goals and therefore as severe a line of potential conflict as the three listed CA's.</blockquote>
Yeah, that was the interesting thing I was finding, too.  GNS helped me out a lot early on (a few years back) in analyzing what I really liked about gaming, and how to better satisfy myself and my fellow players.  I think that the "N" in GNS is just as solid today as it was back then, for example.  However, my recent experiences are much better explained by Creative Agendas (and CA mishmashes) than old GNS. <br/><br/>Going deeper, there may be, I dunno, little terms that can be applied in relation to our creative agendas. Perhaps a sliding scale or grid, comparing our gaming agendas to our social agendas.  There are some groups that are all about the gaming first and foremost and socializing second; this is much like my bi-weekly group (I meet with some other guys: Mark C, Rick, Travis, Tim once every two weeks for some solid indie or other games; Universalis, TROS, TSOY, Burning Wheel, Sorcerer,  and even stuff like Buffy, All Flesh Must Be Eaten, etc). <br/><br/>There are groups where the socializing comes first and the gaming is there in equal amounts, like that gaming group I mentioned above; These groups will probably better weather 'gaming' CA differences, but if there's a 'social' CA difference, then that will be problematic: Like, we had a member join for a while who was hardcore into old-school gaming and when we chit-chatted he got really irritated. He eventually just stopped coming, which was good because we were just about to ask him politely to stop coming.<br/><br/>Going deeper into it, it seems again like there's nothing so black-and-white as "mutually exclusive" or "heirarchical", but rather again a Plane, like a Grid, which one could chart the individual players on; the more some players differ from the group's average, the more likely that the group will come upon a CA mismash...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Considering that Creative Agendas (in capitals) are listed in the Big Model and are limited, as far as I know, to Gamism, Simulationism, and Narrativism, I'm not sure what the difference is between "GNS" and Creative Agendas.<br/><br/>However, the idea that people want different things and that these may clash is both very clear and could be termed something like Player Goals (so as not to imply one of the canonical three).

                            Word.  I don't think "Creative Agenda" necessarily means one of the three recognized/accepted/approved/rubberstamped versions.  There's a website out there that says that it must be one of those three, but there are websites out there that say that JFK was assassinated by aliens, too.  I think creative agenda is a perfectly understandable term using real English: it's what you want to create in the game.  As such, I don't think there's any problem with me saying, "I have a creative agenda" without going on to stipulate G, N, or S.<br/><br/>Further, I think it's an important step forward since this opens up creative agenda to be far more detailed and specific.  It allows us to talk about two different creative agendas that are, roughly speaking, about stories and constructing narratives about moral choices, but are not actually compatible with each other.  My creative agenda is all about challenging the character's identity; your creative agenda is about exploring moral contexts.  <em>Can</em> you satisfy those at the same time?  Sure.  But that doesn't make them the same.<br/><br/>Take that one step more and we can consider reconciling a creative agenda that might be described as "gamist" with another that might be described as "simulationist."  The labels are, in the end, irrelevant.  What matters are the specifics of those creative agenda.  And the array of possibilities are limitless.  Straightjacketing them all into three supercategories has only limited and initial utility.                        </div>

As ever, I think you're absolutely right that this *should* be the case, but I don't think it is in reality.<br/><br/>The difference between "there is a website which says that the phrase 'Creative Agenda' must mean one of G, N or S" and "there is a website which says tht JFK was assassinated by alien nazis from the future" is that the guys who wrote the first website are active members of the RPG community, and have a habit of popping up every time somebody goes against what it says on their website and helpfully setting them straight.

<p>Ben Lehman proposed that there are social agendas orthogonal to Creative Agendas. Andy, that might partially explain what you're seeing.</p>
<p>You're also seeing preferences for particular types of techniques and other aesthetic considerations. If you can figure out the root of those â€” does the dude like percentile systems because they're easy to read? Find a system that's easy to read! Doesn't like linked progression of skills because they're limiting and deprotagonizing? Find a flexible and protagonizing system. Doesn't like player input outside of character because... (I don't know why you'd think this was ever true, so I don't know why he'd want it)? Find a system that doesn't use XP or mechanical player input.</p>
<p>I know it's shocking coming from me, but here's a solution: You start playing with a system you think you'll enjoy. If you figure out why people want what they want, you'll probably have a particular situation that others experience. You figure out how to have the most fun with that system. If you work out how to have fun reliably, you can record the experience, bind it, and sell it for twenty dollars.</p>
<p>(I can't believe I clicked back on this thread, but between Andy and Mike, it sure could be going worse.)</p>

"Somebody" being me, actually. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  And that experience has really got me thinking about developing theory rather than rehashing it.  At some point, the dam is going to break and terminology will start being developed rather than simply being coined.  I have a lot of respect for Ron and a lot of respect for the work that he's done, but that respect is founded on the assumption that it's work that other people are able to build on and elaborate.  If Big Model is Ron's personal playground, the respect I have for the model drops to zero.  Now, I don't think Ron's forwarding that sentiment, but I see a lot of other people online who are.                        </div>

Yes.  Just like id/ego/superego have been developed and refined over time, both during Freud's lifetime and afterwards.  Just like "cause" went from Plato to Aristotle to Aquinas to Descartes.  I'm not saying that this <em>should</em> happen; I'm saying that this <em>will</em> happen.

I will try to keep it brief <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>We were playing GURPs Voodoo.  We had a one-on-one session where there were a lot of in-game conversations and some really crucial personal conflicts happening throughout the session.  Although I had a solid handle on the mechanics of the game I was being introduced to the story in-game. <br/><br/>I latched on to what some characters gave me through exposition and I confronted the Big bad (a corpulant mob boss with spiritual connections that spent his waking hours behind a plate of pasta in his own restaurant).  Despite the player knowing this guy could crush me mechanically I threatened him with his own fork.  In turn he let me know that the only way my family was to survive my blunder was to disappear.  The only reason I survived was because I was to be useful to him down the road.<br/><br/>Fearfully I searched for some guidance and found out my local preist was a magic wielding Rosecrucian.  His advise was to leave for the time being and they will see what they can do to protect my family.  In inquiring what I can do to help he said there really wasn't anything I could do.  The GM was floored when I produced the bastards fork asking if it could be of use.<br/><br/>The reason I regale you with this story is becasue this was definatly a point of dual payoffs - I ended the session saying "wow, what a gripping story and what a fantastic driving premise" but I also had a fit of pride and accomplishment that I so cleverly gained a mechanical advantage the GM had not aniticipated.<br/><br/>Any questions that would help me understand the perspective.  yeah I get the CA - all coming to the table with the same expectations.  But I am curious how dominant a CA might be in ones gaming.<br/><br/><i>Edited to catch up with my post reading <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></i> </div>

                            And, for just a second, it seems worth considering that the meanings of terms like "superego" and "cause" developed through usage.  That someone had something they were trying to talk about and needed a word to use, and one word or another made sense to use.  Or, someone used a term in a way that they understood it that might be different from the common usage, and other's agreed.

Which amounts to something like the <i>Institute Francais,</i> sometimes.  To be honest, the example of "force" is a good one.  When it did get brought up, there were a lot of us who shared Josh's understanding of the term.  This discussion is reminding me of the mental twist I dealt with when reading <cite>Sorcerer,</cite> because there were plenty of terms (granted, old GNS) that I knew and used and had meaning for, used in a radically different way, "force" being one of them.<br/><br/>So, I kind of think that we get into trouble arbitrarily making up words, and do a lot better if we have something we need to discuss and come to an understanding on what to call it.  Freud wasn't setting out to make up words.  He perceived (rightly or wrongly) three actors within the mind, and for the purposes of discussion gave them names.  His contemporaries picked up the usages as "what Freud calls 'the id'," and eventually it simply became simpler to treat the terms as common parlance.<br/><br/>But we're getting off the subject.                        </div>

<p>Don, these are all fictional events, except for the GM's surprise. Fictional events can, all things being equal, serve any CA.</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest that you write this up as an AP post in a new thread. I'd really like to know what you and the GM wanted and expected out of the interacton , not just fictional stuff that happened.</p>
<p>Until you do that, though, I speculate (and this is based on insufficient information) that he expected you to be cowed by his bigass NPC and you saw a clever solution. I'd guess that he's playing Sim â€” he wants to show you his world, in this case, his bigass NPC. Your interest is in showing him that you've come up with a cool solution. That's Gamist play. If you'd wanted to sacrifice your character in a shower of blood because you think that's how systems based on violence end, that would be Narr play.</p>
<p>If he was showing you this big dude to see if you could come up with a solution to the problem he was representing, he'd be engaged in Gamist play and would be totally cool with you sidestepping his plans because that's what you were there to do.</p>
<p>I think GURPS is unequipped for that kind of thing, though because of Rule Zero ("All of these rules matter, except when the GM wants a different result, so none of these rules matter.") It's cool when you've got minis on a hex map, but it's a different thing when you're in a "role-playing" sequence, rather than a tactical sequence; only Rule Zerio really applies.</p>
<p>I'm simplifying â€” I'm assuming that this kind of interaction is <em>usually</em> what happens, and that's important. If you're both playing to make a Godfather-like tragedy about the cycle of violence (Narr play) and you're like, "I fork him in the eye!" and he's like, "Holy shit! Awesome" then that doesn't make it Gamist play. I'm talking about what play is <em>usually</em> like in this game. That's why I'd need to know more to say more specifically.</p>
<p>My point in the OP was that, as soon as he wants something and you want something else, you wind up in an untenable situation until you resolve that mismatch. You can do that by stating it up front or playing with a rule system that supports the CA you want.</p>

I agree with your assertion of the possibility of mismatch.  I'd add that you might resolve the mismatch after it's discovered, although the longer you play with it, the greater the chance that the bad feelings arising as a result will make resolution impossible.  (And that it's a mistake to resolve it in play - as separate from in the midst of play.)  On the other hand, nowhere in Don's anecdote do I see the suggestion of a mismatch.<br/><br/>But, honestly, I'm more and more losing track of the utility of identifying and classifying creative agendas.  I might almost say "a CA like Capes'" before "a Narrativist CA."<br/><br/>Finally, I'm also beginning to see creative agenda's as primarily useful for describing a specific dysfunction, which makes me leery of them.  Certainly, I want to know the difference between (by analogy) a cold and a fever and which to feed, but I don't want to centralize my understanding of winter fun around them, if you see what I'm saying.  Specifically drawing categories of creative agendas only seems like it would worsen any existing dysfunction: "I've got a Narrativist agenda?  Are you with me, or do you have a different agenda?"                        </div>

<p>There was a mismatch: the GM started blocking Don's input when he did something unexpected. When something like that comes up, the players (among them, the GM) should probably stop and discuss it outside of the fiction. One way to deal with it is the GM saying "Awesome!" and giving you 100 CPs (or whatever's arbitrarily significant) and then saying "You have a flash vision of the gout of blood spraying from his wound. He pulls out the fork just as he expires. His bodyguards kill the shit out of you but his empire comes crashing down as his sons fight for his territory. I'm saying this because I want to use this guy for something later, so, good move, you get full credit, and let's pick up from here like you didn't do that."</p>
<p>Judson, drawing lines around a CA means that we can all play Agon together. I'm not worried about the responsibilities that come with being worshipped as a god. I'm not worried about the faces of the dead who lie around me. I'm not thinking about the girl I left back home. <em>Except insofar as it drives me to kick more ass.</em> It's implicit in the system we're using because it's designed to facilitate a certain type of play.</p>
<p>But if I'm playing Hero's Banner or In a Wicked Age, we're doing' something else. We know that because of the game we chose and we did so with full knowledge. Without being able to figure out what kind of play we want, we can't make that decision.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>There was a mismatch: the GM started blocking Don's input when he did something unexpected.</blockquote>
See, I didn't read that there at all.  I read an awesome story with some good opposition, including the heavy word from fatso mob boss culminating in a particularly awesome piece of sympathetic magic that I wish I'd been the GM to see.  And ultimately, neither of us was there and Don didn't say "and I felt stymied when..." or anything like that.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Judson, drawing lines around a CA means that we can all play Agon together.</blockquote>
All we need to play Agon is a flag in the sand so that we know roughly where to camp.  Drawing lines and calling it Kickassismia (only have heard about <cite>Agon</cite> so I'm not about to talk about what kind of play it supports), and suddenly there's folks outside the lines, and upset and bloodshed that's not arbitrated by a combat system.  And if I play <cite>Agon</cite> with my friends, we might just pitch that flag well away from where you would, and there's not much the rules text can do to stop us.  I think we pitch that flag pretty easily without talking about it.  It's only when we're at odds that there's a problem.  So: creative agendas is a great concept for helping to identify that as a problem.  <br/><br/>The idea of creative agendas is possibly useful for design purposes, in terms of centralizing around a kind of play that you have in mind.  But I think that's a very different issue, and the applications may be separate enough that the underlying concepts are actually only relatives, rather than the same individual.                        </div>

                            I think it's been pretty obvious from the beginning that CA, as written, was a starting point. The virtue of the discussions around GNS was that they trained a lot of people to be more sensitive towards clashing agendas. It's only now that all that has been done that you can have conversations like this thread.                        </div>
