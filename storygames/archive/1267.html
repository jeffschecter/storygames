                    Folks have been talking about "Situation" lately, and how to build 'em.  Here's what I'm thinkin', and I'd appreciate feedback:<br/><br/>A good situation is: a status quo, a threat to the status quo, and a reason to care.  (I'm aware that somebody, maybe Ron, defined Situation as the intersection of Character and Setting.  This isn't helpful to me conceptually or practically, so if I've gotten it wrong, someone should step in.)  <br/><br/>A kicker in Sorcerer meets the definition: here's what the sorcerer has been up to lately, here's how things have changed lately, and here's why drastic, immediate action is required.  A town in Dogs in the Vineyard is a situation: there's a utopian community seething with resentment, demons find an opportunity to cause harm, and the Dogs care because it's their job.  Clinton's AG&amp;G Oracle isn't a situation; it just provides some randomized, evocative images, which players then use to create a "backstory in motion."<br/><br/>It's easy enough to adapt this to non-RPG narratives--Star Wars, Watchmen, the Iliad, etc.  <br/><br/>I suspect that a good situation involves a threat that really hammers the issues implicit in the status quo.  The reason to care--i.e., the spur to action--can work on two levels: why the character's got to do something (which is usually a question of plotting &amp; character development), and why the audience should give a damn (which probably involves emotional pandering, to a greater or lesser agree).  <br/><br/>Rip this to shreds.  I'm sure it's too simplistic, but hopefully it's a baby step in the right direction.                </div>

                            Okay ... rippy, rip, rip, rip.<br/><br/>Why have a status quo?<br/><br/>Situation:  The universe was JUST CREATED TEN SECONDS AGO.  You are neophyte Gods.  You're not even Gods <b>of</b> anything yet, because until you create things there isn't anything.  But Big Daddy God is sitting there smirking, the judgmental bastard, and everything about your relationship with him and with the rest of your family is going to depend upon the decision you make <i>right now</i>, and how it meshes with all of the other decisions everyone else makes, out until the Last Trump.<br/><br/>Sound like a good one?

                            Tony, (a) that example feels pretty contrived, (b) in my opinion, there [i]is[/i] a status quo there--you're gods, with a relationship to some other God--but IMO it would be splitting hairs needlessly to respond at greater length, (c) according to my theory, a situation is juicier the more the threat bangs on the status quo, which may explain (a), since most of the banging comes on the vague stuff players bring to that scenario.  But maybe there's more there, or there's a richer analogue I haven't seen.<br/><br/>Jason-- yeah, maybe.  I'd suspect, though, that an audience (say, someone sitting in on your game without playing) might want a reason to care.  Or, for the players, a reason to decide to play the game, rather than go out for dinner.<br/><br/>Furthermore: I'll suggest that any Situation which can't be adequately summarized in 50 well chosen words sucks ass.  Take that, pointlessly complex D&amp;D settings &amp; modules!  (I have no idea if this follow-up proposition is true or not, but I'd like it to be.)                        </div>

                            Yeah, I think there's a couple of different personas during play, at least in indie commie hippie games.  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17422.msg188713#msg188713" rel="nofollow">Here's the first three or so which come to mind for me personally.</a>  For all I know, this stuff is implicit in all the talk about "stances" and so on.  (It's possible that an game is more emotionally hard-hitting to the extent that it throws these personas into conflict within each player, but I don't have enough experience to say for sure, and that's a side issue right now.)<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you're saying about routines, but I have no working knowledge of improv.  I'd suspect that the audience cares about improvised disruptions, not because they're disruptions <i>per se</i>, but because improvisations are often wacky non-sequiturs, and non-sequiturs are entertaining.  A disruption of that magnitude is worth watching in itself.<br/>
<br/>
But I could be totally talking out of my ass here due to inexperience.  Tell me: in practice, is it fascinating to watch/perform mundane disruptions of the routine?  ("Honey, I know you're watching TV, but could you take out the trash?")<br/>
<br/>
Building on backstory - if you've got a rudimentary situation (as I've defined it here) but you want to move it forward a few iterations before the players arrive on the scene, in <i>Story</i> Robert McKee suggests that most people take the most conservative approach to perilous situations to the extent they perceive their options.  I'm not sure I agree with this, but it seems like a decent rule of thumb.<br/>
<br/>
(Actually, there's been a lot of love for <i>Impro</i> around here.  I'd nominate <i>Story</i> for some examination too.)                        </div>

                            That sounds like a book club thread waiting to be started!<br><br>I'm not Joe improv expert, but in my training I've been taught to build gradually, to measure conflict, and to avoid non sequiturs like the plague.  That's akin to trying to be funny, which is the proverbial kiss of death.  People like to see honesty, so if somebody offers "Will you take out the trash?" their partner is going to build on that in an interesting way, maybe something as simple as a wistful "I'll never take the trash out again."

Hmmmm. While I intend to agree, say, when introducing your campaign to new players at the beginning of the game (say that, for example, you came up with the Situation which you foisted upon the players, "OK let's make up some characters and play", or somehow came up with a group setting and the 50 Words was your opening summary)... I'm not sure about game settings in general.<br><br>For example... crap, I don't want to keep banging this drum since the game's not out yet and currently exists in this hazy "90% translated" state. However, in Tenra Bansho, the setting is pretty tight. It doesn't meander throughout the book in fiction samples and "the chief export of City X is Blah" statements. Rather it gives a Very brief and hole-filled (so that people can fill in the details themselves without having to rely on Setting Books) intriduction to the game world and the events of the last 40 years or so.<br><br>Anyway, as I read the setting, I find basically one Situation-ripe setting element in pretty much each and every paragraph. It was really masterfully written IMO, with a focus on "getting into play", "setting up a rich background world", "not setting it up too much that it stops people from jumping into play", "filling it with just enough ideas to get going, and no more". So none of that "10 pages which include 5 situation-ripe elements" that we see in like old school campaign settings and the like. And yet, none of the "here's a bunch of setting crap; now you have to entirely find the situation yourself" setup like other games.<br><br>Now, when it was written the author wasn't thinking in terms like Situation, so I'm writing a section now on how to basically read the setting, find something "juicy' you want to focus on, and quickly turn that into a Situation for play. I might even rip off some of the cooler elements of Burning Empires to do it (like a questionnaire to get people started).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm all about the building of sitaution these days. I absolutely do not start making characters (even as player) until everyone is on the same page with What's Going On In Our Story (even if it's simply "You're a bunch of elves that go exploring the dungeons for fame and money"). I think that settings CAN be manipulated carefully to be Situation-pushing thingies. I'm not ready to dismiss all settings that don't focus on One Situation out the door, either.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            One of my big problems with most games - and books, movies, comics, and nearly every story I run across, in fact - is the idea that the status quo is worth protecting. A lot of the time I prefer to *be* the threat to the status quo. It's one of the reasons I like playing Exalted.<br/><br/>I realize it's not explicitly outlawed in your original statement, but it does seem to be implicitly ignored.                        </div>

                            Andy, I'm not sure I believe my own follow-up about "50 words or less," but just for clarification, I'm using Situation solely in terms of an individual game session--the "adventure," "module," "episode," or whatever the hell we call these things.  From the perspective of <i>designing a full RPG</i>, then yeah, the 50 words or less idea is crap unless you get super-general.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly I'm looking at Situation from the perspective of, "Gee, my GM'ing is often pretty hit-or-miss.  What am I supposed to be doing, and how can I do it reliably?"<br/>
<br/>
Regarding setting, it sounds like the game you mentioned is pretty cool, and gets it just right.<br/>
<br/>
Jason -- I stand corrected, though I think my "give them a reason to care" checkbox, if not a requirement, is still a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Tony-- would you agree that a key skill in playing Capes well is the ability to concoct threats to the status quo finely calculated to appeal (or not appeal) to the interests of other players?  It seems like the economy of Capes is basically defined by your ability to generate sizzling or flat situations, depending--but I haven't played it enough to say for sure.                        </div>

                            Colin, I'm not using "status quo" in a political or economic sense, just in terms of narrative structure.  Like, in "The Empire Strikes Back."  The status quo is, "Here's this Rebel Alliance base on Hoth," and the threat is, "Damn, here comes the Empire."  I don't know much about Exalted, but it's quite possible to have a proactive hero, reacting to a bad status quo just as easily.  The main point is that there's change, or threatened change, and there's a reason for the fictional (and perhaps the real) people to care.                        </div>

                            James - the whole "reason to care" thing opens up a couple of issues.<br><br>First, as Jason suggested, audiences will just naturally start to care, regardless of content: it's pretty natural to want to know what happens next when we encounter a situation where the outcome is uncertain.<br><br>Second, presentation counts.  Just because I care about something in the abstract, doesn't necessarily mean I'll be engaged by it when it shows up in a game, story, etc. - it could be handled in a boring manner, for instance.  Also, there are things I might not care about in general, that, when presented to me in the right way, I will get invested in.  (This happened to me during our Capes session).<br><br/>Relatedly, I think we can look at different situation prep options that result in fun/functional game play, but, to a certain extent, these are going to be specific by game.  Sorcerer's player-authored kickers work best when hooked into a GM-created Sorcerer's Soul-style relationship map; town creation in Dogs in the Vineyard is tied pretty tightly to the rest of that game's setting and system.<br/><br/>And I'd note that other games are set up slightly differently: in Trollbabe or in more traditional D&amp;D modules, it is the entrance of the PCs onto the scene that disrupts the status quo.<br/><br/>In InSpectres, the situation is that the PCs are trying to get a start-up off the ground.  The GM is there to provide adversity.  This works extremely well and I think you have to squint pretty hard at it to make it fit into your framework.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

You're saying that a situation is "There's this first scene ... and then there's a threat that the second scene will be different from the first"?&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.  And maybe it's the first Act, rather than the first Scene, to get all theatrical about it.  Certainly in a lot of very famous stories, the story really is about the working out of the issues implicit in the very earliest part.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at a lot of stories, novels, and plays, what you've basically got is a character thrown into an uncomfortable situation.  He/she tries to remedy the situation.  The remedy either makes things worse, or if it makes things better does so in an unstable way, which decays into a worse situation over time.  Eventually the character tries something pretty drastic, and either wins or loses.  If the audience finds the drastic step enlightening or moving, that's a nice thing to have in a story.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly how that initial Situation feeds into the machinery of the plot is probably a function of Setting and Character, and of side-plot Situations developing along the way.  But for a number of stories, that initial Situation can serve to summarize the issues in play, if you've got a good craftsman and an attentive audience.<br/>
<br/>
Sorcerer is built more or less explicitly along these lines.<br/>
<br/>
Jon, I've got class in 2 minutes, so I'll have to think about that.                        </div>

                            Awww, damit, Josh beat me to it. James is talking about conflict. Conflicts are part of a good situation in all likelihood, but not the sum total. Potential conflicts are good, as are other things that might lead to theme emerging in play. Like, oh, say, a religion. Doesn't have to be contentious at all, but it can be something that play revolves around. <br><br>Mike                        </br></br></div>

Joshua, maybe that's a more useful group of words, but I fail to see how it's much different from, "Big change viewed in appropriate context."  Like, instead of status quo, threat to status quo, and motivation I could just as easily say, "This shit here is cool!  And then this other crazy shit over here happens!  Go go go!"  <br/><br/>Mike, how is a religion by itself "situation"?  If you're saying the religion might be pregnant with "story energy", ready to emerge, I think that falls under the "this shit here is cool" phase.  Likewise with an emotionally conflicted character, and so on.  It's stuff waiting to happen.<br/><br/>Could someone explain the Full Light, Full Steam stuff, briefly?  Because I'd be surprised if I can't fit it to this procrustean bed of mine.                        </div>

                            James, you seem intent on this status quo/context being changed thing.  While, yes, a lot of stories and situations do incorporate this motif, it's not a required element.  There is no big status quo/context being threatened in <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em> or <em>Persuasion</em>.  Redefining situation in terms of conflicts (which are themselves defined as character + desire + obstacle) gives you a constellation of characters, desires, and obstacles some of which<em> may</em> be the threatened status quo, but not necessarily.<br/><br/><em>FLFS</em> Situation Engineering goes something like this:<br/>a) gather player flags (such as thematic batteries)<br/>b) create three conflicts using two or more flags each (loyal + colonist = starving colonists plead with PC to steal military supplies for them)<br/>c) figure out five "cogs" (characters, sets, props) that are necessary for each of the three conflicts (for the above: starving colonist, food, supply depot, guards, colony)<br/>d) complicate the cogs by overlapping them (the starving colonist from one conflict is also the resistence leader of another conflict)<br/>e) assign one complicated cog to each PC as a foil<br/>f) write up the cogs with stats and stuff<br/>g) write a short paragraph (~200 words) to describe everything going on, including the way the PCs are made aware of the situation<br/><br/>For what it's worth, Judson, Sitch Engineering was my attempt to take <em>Dogs</em> Town Creation and make it more universal.  The same procedure can be used regardless of setting to create many-layered situations that directly engage the PCs.  You just need an appropriate input for the flags -- which can be lots of things.                        </div>

See, I have a question about this, at the audience level (I accept that it's true at the fictional character level).  If it's true, then people would never get bored watching a new movie, or reading a new book.  The outcome is unknown, and if I'm understanding you guys, that's enough.  Why, then, are so many high school students, including those who normally like to read, bored to tears by <i>Babbitt</i>?
<blockquote>Second, presentation counts</blockquote>
That might just be a variation on knowing your audience?<br/><br/>Incidentally, throughout this thread I've been moving across story-game sessions, novels, movies, and so on, mainly because I think that Situation, whatever its defintion, is common to all of them at this level of abstraction.  Whatever general theory works for one medium ought to hold true, more or less, across the board.  Story-games have different inputs and procedures, but it seems like the output is something very familiar (by design).                        </div>

Sure, all I'm saying is that while SitchEng <i>a la</i> <cite>Full Light, Full Steam</cite> could be applied to any game where you can pull out flags, (which really, should be any game where you know the <em>players</em> ahead of time), could any possible situation come out of SE?  <br/><br/>Maybe the distinction isn't that important.  I'm sure you could keep a group of players going indefinitely on SE influenced play.  But maybe there are valuable avenues we close off by using a single method?<br/><br/>If we're looking for a procedure, I still stand by the idea of situation patterns.  By way of example, SE seems to be the result of a few patterns I'll suggest off the cuff: flags, compositing (both of flags to suggest conflicts and of cogs to produce foils), supporting elements (which you call cogs), foils, and hooks.<br/><br/>Is it cogent here to make more of a pitch?  I don't know that I'm eager to start a whole discussion about this, since design patterns are (in my opinion) really awesome, but also a source of some contention in their source discipline.                        </div>

                            Oh, James, I'm going to have to violently disagree with you on "situation for all media is essentially the same."<br/><br/>In novels, film, narrative poetry, and things I'll call "planned works," situation is a rather cynically constructed juxtaposition of elements that the author(s) plan to use to forward their predetermined purpose.  Consider <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> -- there is nothing in Lilliput or how Gulliver gets there that does not directly serve Swift's purpose.<br/><br/>In roleplaying and other "unplanned works" like improv and television serials, situation is a juxtaposition that the creators expect to yield interesting fiction.  Touchstone here being <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> or <em>Buffy</em>, where the creators certainly had an idea of what they wanted to see to start with, but certainly did not plan out the entire scope of the series before they shot the first episode.  The idea here is to seed the situation with enough 'oomph' to provide drama, comedy, and excitement for as long as possible.<br/><br/><em>Note of warning:</em> Babylon 5 is a novel expressed as a television show and constitutes a notable exception to my point, here.  On the other hand, <em>Great Expectations</em> is often considered a novel but is, in fact, a collected series of chapbooks and is closer to an unplanned work.<br/><br/>In planned works, situation is a <em>pretext</em>.  In unplanned works, it's a playground.  Very big difference.                        </div>

<blockquote>Fit this one to the iron bed: characters are outlaws, drifting from place to place. Situation is the happy, thriving community they descend upon.</blockquote>
There are two easy ways to do this, which makes me think I'm missing something.<br/><br/><b>From the outlaws' POV</b><br/><b>This shit here is cool! -</b> We spend a little bit of time (ten seconds to a full act) getting to know the outlaw band.  Isn't it cool being an outlaw, and being bad, and drifting along?  Gee, I wish we had some more money.  And Black Bart over here being a jerk, as usual.  And maybe some dude is injured from a bank heist two towns over, or whatever.  <br/><br/><b>This shit over here is cool too! - </b> The outlaws come across... Mayberry.  And suddenly everything goes berzerk.  The outlaws raid the town, and there's an immediate conflict of interest between the desperado's and the townsfolk.  But more importantly, the town serves to bang on the "story energy" (potential conflicts) within the bandits' "status quo".  The whole way of life that Mayberry represents exerts a seductive pull on the bandits: Mad Molly wants to turn respectable, the gang leader decides to spare the children (which triggers a succession struggle within the group) and so on.  <br/><br/><b>Go Go Go! -</b> For the bandits: Mayberry initially represents easy pickin's (an appeal to greed), a way out of this lifestyle (an appeal to self-improvement), a chance to seize control of the gang through ruthlessness (more self-improvement, in a way), resources to help the gunshot dude, hostages to use against the Marshalls, whatever.<br/><br/>For the audience/participants: Here, part of the appeal is the "bad boy" image of the bandits (at least for me as an audience member).  Lots of cussin', violence, and hell-for-leather gritty gang stuff.<br/><br/><b>From Mayberry's POV</b><br/><b>This shit here is cool! -</b> Establishing shots of Mayberry, the idyllic hick town.  Except maybe it isn't, and there's some seething stuff going on.<br/><br/><b>This other shit is cool too! -</b> Then bandits show up!  Gunfight!  Down goes Andy Griffith, and the only guy who can save the town is Barney Fife.  Can Barney, the deputy doofus, hold the town together?  Can he fend off the bandits?  What about the clean-cut girl next door who falls for the dangerous allure of the chief bandit?  <br/><br/><b>Go Go Go! -</b> For the villagers, the motivation is pretty obvious: they're under attack.  For the audience, the appeal here is probably a bit of emotional manipulation: nostalgia for small country towns, fears of outsiders coming in and messing the place up, etc.  And probably there's some interest in watching Barney's character arc.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>In novels, film, narrative poetry, and things I'll call "planned works"</blockquote>
Joshua, I don't think the juxtaposition works, at least not as you've drawn it here.  Which authors sit down to write a book, or a play, or a poem, knowing <i>in advance</i> how it's going to turn out?  I suspect that novelists, like RPG players, are often surprised by what comes out.  For example, J.K. Rowling claims she had no idea if Harry Potter would live or die in the final volume.  Same deal with Dickens, Joyce, and Stephen King.  It's just that the novelist has months or years to polish the results.
<blockquote>In planned works, situation is a pretext. In unplanned works, it's a playground. Very big difference.</blockquote>
Even if I agree with you, and I'm not sure I do, it's a difference only in how the creators approach storytelling, not in how the non-creators experience the story.<br/><br/>Edit: the whole are RPG-output stories, and if so how do they relate to other kinds of stories, probably deserves a different thread.  I just included those comments in case people were confused about why I'm shifting between media in this thread.                        </div>

                            James, JK Rowling has had the final chapter to book seven written since book two or something similar.  Whether the protagonist lives or dies is, really, an afterthought to whatever the protagonist actually does -- death is just using an exclamation point instead of a period at the end of the sentence.  How Harry deals with Voldemort is pretty set in stone.  But if I was roleplaying Harry Potter (which I wouldn't -- canon settings are bad for roleplaying for <em>exactly this reason</em>), how the PCs deal with Voldemort would be completely up in the air until they did it.<br/><br/>Alternately, when Larry Niven wrote <em>A Gift from Earth</em>, he didn't plan the ending and repeatedly said afterwards, "I will never make that mistake again."<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the creator/non-creator divide is all about -- if we're talking roleplaying, we're the creators, aren't we?                        </div>

No fair using post modernism!  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  My recollection of <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i> is you've got this guy living in 1960's suburbia, doing his thing, a little pleased with himself and a little embarrassed.  And going on in all of that is his memories and recollections of the horrors of the Second World War.  And most of the people he meets, either in the present or the past, have these endearingly fragile, tender needs--and then fate intervenes in some way, and their circumstances change--sometimes in ways which are rewarding, other times in ways that are tragic, and sometimes in very mundane ways.  The characters care because in wartime, people are trying to kill you, and also because in peacetime, it's not always a heck of a lot easier.  <br/><br/>And we're reading because (a) we love Kurt Vonnegut, (b) we feel pretty bad about the bombing of Dresden, (c) we're curious about these oddball characters, (d) the way Vonnegut tells the little stories along the way makes us feel incredibly blessed, and incredibly baffled, to be alive.  <br/><br/>I'm not 100% confident of that summary of <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i>--if someone can supply a better summary, I'd be curious to see if the procedure works.<br/><br/>Like, here's what I'm really saying with this terminology: "You're reading a story.  The story has a beginning.  Then the story has a middle.  Then the story has an end.  <i>Something changed in between each of those sections.</i>"                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite><br/>See, I have a question about this, at the audience level (I accept that it's true at the fictional character level).

Why, then, are so many high school students, including those who normally like to read, bored to tears by<i>Babbitt</i>?</blockquote>
Well, like I said, presentation matters.  And also taste and expectations.  Something that seems predictable or, on the other end, something that is so far outside the audience's experience that they can't really make any predictions at all, is probably not going to engage them for very long.
<blockquote><blockquote>Second, presentation counts</blockquote>
That might just be a variation on knowing your audience?</blockquote>
No - it's not a variation.  "Presentation counts" might include "knowing your audience", but I think it's a bit bigger than that.<br/><br/>But I guess what I'm really saying is that there is no "magic bullet" for making you care about what is going on in a piece of fiction.  I do think we have a natural tendency to invest in unresolved situations (I've certainly experienced getting hooked into the drama of various sporting events that I've bveen forced to watch - I'd assume this or something like this is a pretty common phenomenon).  (And I don't think your <i>Babbit</i> point changes this: note I said "tendency" not "ironclad certainty").  <br/><br/>Also, I agree with Joshua with regard to situation working differently for RPGs and novels, say.  This is why I wanted a loose situation for our Capes game.                        </div>

Implicitly, though, you're making the characters part of the situation.

                            "It's stuff waiting to happen."<br/><br/>Yeah, that's a good definition for situation. Stuff waiting to happen. <br/><br/>Everybody thinks in terms of conflict, because it's pretty definitional of drama. Want dramatic play, have conflict. Thing is, not all play is all drama all the time. Some of it is just noodling around with setting elements or whatnot. Exploration with an intent to create theme, even if it's done sans conflict, is still thematic play. <br/><br/>So, let's say you have a player come up with a ritual in the game related to the central religion that's been set up as a key part of the situation (oh, let's say we're all cardinals in the vatican or something, making religion pretty central to the situation). The nature of the ritual created will be a statement made by the player. Like if it's some devil-worshippy thing, the player may be saying "look at how corrupt the Vatican is!" or "isn't it fun to consider this sort of juxtaposition?" <br/><br/>The point is that resolving bangs or other conflicts is not 100% of the value of RPGs. It's key to pacing and keeping drama part of the equation. But there's a whole lot more subtle stuff going on than just the conflicts. <br/><br/>So I think what you're doing here, James, is talking about how to get drama into play through embedding it in the situation. Which seems like good technique to me. It's just not the sum total of situation. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Okay, that's a given, but I think you're conflating the progress of the story with the situation on which the story is based.  Sure, <em>stuff will change</em>, but that doesn't mean that the changes that occur are intrinsic to the situation as initially created before play begins.                        </div>

                            James -<br/><br/>I'm reading your posts and I get what you are saying, but I'm still not sure how you think this will help you with coming up with good stuff for rpgs in general, without talking about the specifics of how these games are actually played.<br/><br/>Your model still doesn't seem to address how InSpectres works: its one of the most functional games that I know of AND offers a pretty strong model for other RPGs (so strong, in fact, that we essentially borrowed it for our Capes game).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: judson</cite><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite><b>From the outlaws' POV</b><br/><b>This shit here is cool! -</b>We spend a little bit of time (ten seconds to a full act) getting to know the outlaw band.  Isn't it cool being an outlaw, and being bad, and drifting along?  Gee, I wish we had some more money.  And Black Bart over here being a jerk, as usual.  And maybe some dude is injured from a bank heist two towns over, or whatever.<br/></blockquote>
Implicitly, though, you're making the characters part of the situation.  And that 10 second to and Act intro, I'd usually call "chargen."<br/><br/>Ultimately, when you apply it this way, I can't help but feel like your theory is a little glib.  How do I apply it?  What does it get me?<br/><br/>I'm mostly agreed with Judson here.  Notably, I just joined into a "supervillains" game using GURPS.  The situation external to the PCs was simply a twist on the modern world.  There are some people with superpowers, and there are some forces set up to deal with superpowered criminals -- but there is nothing forcing our PCs into action.  <br/><br/>Instead, we're targetting rich people to kidnap, banks to rob, setting up an evil headquarters, and things like that.  I think this is most accurately described as just having a status quo and characters.                        </div>

                            Isn't "we're criminals" a whole heaping helping of implied situation? You're criminals, so you do criminal-y stuff.

Sure, I'd agree with that.  At any given point in the game, there is a situation.  Usually once we've started a job, there is impetus to act, for example.  (i.e. After our kidnap victim alerted the police, say.)

Well, sort of.  However, it gets trickier you're want to use the term "situation" as an element separate from the others of "character", "setting", and "color".  Is "we're criminals" the situation, or is it the characters?                        </div>

The game you described has it as situation, by my lights. "I'm a criminal" isn't a point of characterisation when it applies equally across the protagonists. Character is "how am I a criminal", Setting is "where am I a criminal", Situation is "what am I doing right now". Crime.                        </div>
