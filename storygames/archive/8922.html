The main modifications are that skills are replaced by relationships to all characters (including your own) and the addition of an intermediate layer of dice called 'spotlight dice'. These are earned through the actions of the PCs in the same way as franchise dice and are used to take authority over the central character, in this case Dr. Gregory House. The plot of the episode can only be resolved through the central character, requiring a certain number of episode points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lynchpin for this session was, of course, the patient, which put a fair amount of pressure on Alan who came up with a character, their symptoms and a pre-titles scene on the spur of the moment, so kudos to him! Everyone else chose characters from the TV series, giving us Foreman, Chase, Cameron, Cuddy and Wilson in the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite having a patient to attend to, the plot mostly revolved around the inital revelation that House had commissioned a statue of himself and paid for it by putting it through the hospital finances under Wilson's name. This caused a considerable amount of tension between Wilson &amp; Cuddy as they attempted to sort out who was actually going to pay for it. Meanwhile, by spending the spotlight dice they earned to take authority over him, they had House moving the statue around the hospital to keep it out of their hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in the patient's room, the other characters scratched their heads over the puzzle of a self-proclaimed, self-publicizing psychic-medium who appeared to be suffering from a genuine possession, with physical marks spontaneously manifesting on his body! Foreman &amp; Cameron drew the short straws and had to break into the patient's house, where they were confronted by a cat with poisoned claws. Chase didn't fair much better later, however, when an accident in the lab almost caused the entire hospital to be quarantined to contain a dangerous viral outbreak.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really effective part of the modification, which I was quite pleased with, was the conversion into a GMless game: in each action, the player picks a relationship with a player-character that will be tested in some way by that action. This can lead to the target or the acting character being imperilled or, if they were already in peril, rescued. Since a character in peril cannot imperil anyone else, a genuine cycle of risk &amp; reward was created, with players thinking up ways to screw over other characters, which set them up to be rescued from the situation, which meant they could be imperilled again and so on. As guide through the session, I was genuinely able to sit back for most of the time, with my input only consisting of reminding players when they gained spotlight dice and whispering bad thoughts in their ears like the Evil side of their conscience.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback was good and I got some ideas for streamlining and tweaking the game: for example, giving each player a two-sided card, which they turned dark-side up when they were in peril and reurned to the light-side when they were rescued. It was also suggested that, instead of losing spotlight dice more or less at random, in the manner of the Bank Roll chart from InSpectres, players should have the option to spend them for directorial authority, in the manner of the Confessional. These tweaks willl be implemented soon in the next playtest of the modification: Doctor Who!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197011/#Comment_197011" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T09:31:23+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  9:31AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a fun game!

There were several beautiful moments of players screwing their own characters, then buying authority over House to dig themselves out of it: didn't always work in their favour, which is what made it breath-takingly beautiful!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, wish I'd had that big picture of House on the day! I wanted a totemic representation of House to be passed around with the authority over him: a face mask would have been perfect!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
