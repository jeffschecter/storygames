But taking the mobs on himself becoming main player.<br/><br/>Objections: It looks like it's still first players scene and mobs are coming after him, second player clearly third side in the conflict also counting his PATH, while first player is already in direct conflict and not so obvious connection to his path.<br/><br/>what would be your ruling and reasoning?<br/><br/>a) first player should defend himself while second player can help with discipline dice;<br/>b) both should roll dice and more hits wins right to be main player;<br/>c) with no objections from first player, second player have all rights to attack mobs.<br/><br/>BTW it looks like by "helping out" second player effectively steals focus and scene                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412398/#Comment_412398" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T05:32:26+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  5:32AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generally games with character-focused universal conflict resolution systems, such as DRYH, deal with this sort of thing by latching individual conflicts to individual characters. The means for this is usually related to the terminology of stakes: what are <i>your</i> stakes in this situation? Do you wish to raise a conflict over this? This sort of phrasing moves the focus from the concrete situation to the personal struggle of an individual character.<br/><br/>In your example situation my take would be to ask the first player whether he intends to conflict the outcome at all. If he does, then it's a given that it is his conflict. Next, the other player could decide whether they'd like to help. Assuming the first player decides to not resist the mobs, then the GM is free to narrate what happens to him, and the spotlight moves to the other player: now that another character is being harassed and overcome by a mob (of monsters?), do you interfere, or do you take care of your own business? It's essentially a new situation that came about because the first character lost or gave up.<br/><br/>This means that off-hand (it's been a while since I read the DRYH rules) I'd be likely to play through this sort of scene in one of two ways: either the characters fight together, in which case the initial PC is the primary character, or the second character does not entangle themselves into the situation at all before the first character has already lost, in which case they may make their own decision and have their own conflict over it. So it's either one conflict with PC <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> in the lead, or two conflicts one after the other. Of course I would not allow the second character to both aid the first and then afterwards recontest the same thing - they blew their load and defined their relationship to the scene by joining in as a helper in the first place.<br/><br/>It should be noted that there is no "good" reason for why a  character can't pass off a conflict in this kind of game to somebody else; it's just the way these games are constructed to emphasize protagonism. If it helps, you might think of the right and initiative to have a conflict in the first place as a prerogative that is tied to your status as a spotlighted protagonist; anybody may struggle in the fiction, sure, but we will only allow the influence and rights related to the conflict resolution sequence to certain characters at certain times. In games that give characters turns in the spotlight (DRYH, My Life with Master, Primetime Adventures, Dust Devils...) this sometimes means that players can't pass the buck nilly-willy. Insofar as the dramatic reality of the game goes, the issue in this type of scene is not whether somebody else can save your character, but whether they can be saved at all, and that's what the player rolls the dice for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/samwise" title="samwise"><img alt="samwise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/samwise">samwise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412442/#Comment_412442" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T23:18:22+00:00" title="April 22, 2013 11:18PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for extensive answer.<br/><br/>-&gt; mobs? - I was thinking about how much theme related terminology I should use and voil\xe0 - there it goes.<br/>Mob is short from mobster, maybe I have overplayed that stuff.
