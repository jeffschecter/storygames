I'm wondering if it would break the game too badly to go to a rolled initiative or something else.<br/>My players are really enjoying the game so far and are fond of the Karma rules and are getting into the dynamics of passing karma tokens around for whatever cool stuff happens.<br/>And yes, this one is a little gonzo, too.  Something about the setting just lets in the gonzo from the cold.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410297/#Comment_410297" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T06:56:36+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  6:56AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved the phased combat! What was problematic for you? <br/><br/>Shadow-hack uses the same system - in one of the playtest recordings, I found that the players were confused. Rather than only rolling for initiative when two opposing characters were acting in the same phase, they tried to to roll it at the beginning of each round like D&amp;D and that just screwed the whole process from there on. When I first read Old School Hack, I didn't notice that - it wasn't until my, like, 3rd or 4th read-through that I realized you don't roll initiative at the beginning of the round.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh" title="Chugosh"><img alt="Chugosh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/289/nOED25F16XENN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh">Chugosh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410306/#Comment_410306" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T08:16:51+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  8:16AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not all that different from your own players' experience, really.  The phased combat has a lot going for it, but my problem was more losing track of who was doing what.  I also have trouble with each turn being just one thing, move, attack defend or whatever.  I am just so used to everything being move and act, that move OR act is strange.  If I'm working with a map, it would be easier, but the fight in question I simply narrated through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410309/#Comment_410309" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T09:02:15+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  9:02AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2013 9:03AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't looked at Retrocolypse in a while, but movement within a particular combat arena or zone is free (I think they call them zones in that game?). <br/><br/>So, let's say we have the standard fallout battle area of a pre-war torn up street riddled with old cars (dense zone), with some ruined buildings (each a dense zone or hazardous zone) with alley ways (tight zones) on one side and vacant sandy lot (open zone) on the other. So these are your combat zones. If your character is in the vacant lot, they can move around freely in that fictional space, never having to take the Move action.  They only have to use the Move action to transition to an adjacent zone (like dipping into the car riddled street).<br/><br/>At the beginning of combat, tell the players the what the enemies are going to do, then let them pick their actions. Go to phase 1 and say "Who's acting now? Okay Dogmeat, you're going in the same phase as this slaver thug, so we need to roll initiative to see who pulls of their action first in this phase." Then go to the next phase. If only players are acting in a phase, they just get to go, in any order they want, or even simultaneously really. If only an enemy is acting in this phase, the enemies just go.<br/><br/>This means you may not ever have to roll initiative in a combat scene, as long as opposing characters aren't acting in the same phase. Once you get the hang of it, it goes quickly. It helps to use the combat tracker sheets that you can print out. <br/><br/>All this being said, I'm not crazy about structured combat systems like this any more. It focuses too much on mechanics and not enough on fiction. But they can definitely still be fun.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410313/#Comment_410313" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T10:31:45+00:00" title="March 24, 2013 10:31AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it really helps to have an actual map and markers keeping track of what's going on. If you're doing that, it flows very smoothly! (And, as Zachary_Wolf points out, you don't necessarily need to roll initiative when two people are in the same phase; only if it's important to know who goes first for some reason.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
