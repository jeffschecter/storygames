<br/>
Each player plays an editor of (original) D&amp;D. Each editor has a separate creative agenda, and attempts to make the rules fit his/her agenda. After all rules have been edited, players switch games: Now, they play a role-playing game with the new D&amp;D rules.                </div>

                            WHEREAS:<br/>
<br/>
* Many D&amp;D players want a Wiki-ized version of the d20 SRD<br/>
* D&amp;D house rules are common <br/>
* Nomic is cool (I admittedly only learned of it last week)<br/>
* D&amp;D 4th Edition discussions are good troll bait<br/>
<br/>
THEREFORE:<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a D&amp;D d20 SRD wiki. Seeded with the vanilla d20 SRD (or the slick d20srd.org version), then people can edit the wiki to share their house rules. Players and GMs can change the rules wiki.. even during a D&amp;D game! Nomic rules require some sort of rule voting, so the wiki could either enforce a voting system for new changes or just rely on the vigilant Wikipedia-style editors acting as the "white blood cells" of the rules.<br/>
<br/>
And just let it grow from there.. <br/>
<br/>
This post started as a joke, but I'm now actually curious how such a project would turn out (i.e. how soon it would utter collapse).                        </div>

                            I've run two nomic experiments. <br/><br/>The latest I ran on a wiki and it went a dozen turns before the 6-8 players lost momentum or interest. Lessons learned: Nomic participants should have an <i>agenda</i> for the nomic to succeed. I modified Peter Suber rules slightly to account for some wiki differences. I probably still have them around if people care.<br/><br/>The first I ran on a MUSH. We used the <a href="http://www.nomic.net/~nomicwiki/index.php/PureNomicRuleset" rel="nofollow">Pure Nomic ruleset</a> ("All players must agree to any changes to the game.") and built from there. We progressed through hundreds of new rules. We coded a proposal / rule database and voting machine in mushcode (instituted by rule, too). Some initial players had gotten the impression that the goal of the game was to create a role-playing mush by committee, which was interesting. I told them that we could very easily make that the goal, by law. No one really pushed it. Most the 'let's create a new RP mush' people left and the hardcore nomic 'let's fuck around with rule systems' folks stayed on. I used a loophole to declare myself emperor for a week, then I undid the loophole with my effective dictatorial power and abdicated my position. The nomic ceased to be fun for me after I had "won" it. When my attention waned, so did that of other people, and we eventually shut it down due to inactivity.<br/><br/>Talk to me if you have serious ideas about building a RPG-building nomic.                        </div>

<b>Adam</b>: was your MUSH Nomic the game itself or just the "process" to create a "real" game ruleset? I understand that Nomic has both rules and a (dynamic) winning condition.

                            Matthijs, I'm working on something slightly similar to this in my Gormenghast-inspired game, where you can basically make up rules and rituals which you and the other characters are bound by for the rest of the game, and anyone can invoke against you (or on your behalf).  I haven't playtested yet but it seems to be an interesting system direction - though I'm finding it needs definite regulation or the game goes into lala land very fast.<br/><br/>Sneezel: "I want to make it to the clock tower before she does.  I'll take the back stairs!"<br/>Pulcheria: "I invoke ritual.  No one may take the back stairs without falling to their knees and kissing every step three times."<br/>[conflict ensues; I'm still working out the details, but suppose Pulcheria wins]<br/>Sneezel: "Hmm.  Guess I"ll have to find another route and hope that I can still beat her."<br/><br/>I hadn't thought about applying this to meta-fictional elements (i.e. to the rules of the game itself) but it would be a pretty neat thing to play around with.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            matthij's original idea could be done with od&amp;d, the game set of course in a carpeted basement somewhere in the upper midwest of the u.s sometime in the early 70s. You could also rewrite other source material, from the most tragic heartbreaker to your favorite focused indie game. <br/>
<br/>
 I really like the direction this thread's taken on  in-game ritual justification.  Jess, the gormenghast game sounds excellent. As a potential player I'd like to see my ability to invent rituals be somewhat constrained as you mention -- not just to avoid a surreal explosion of rules -- but so the weight of rituals  'controls' the players as much as the players shape the rules. Maybe players could primarily invent ritual in areas that their characters would know (the sauce-ladeler  invoking food taboos) and when your character meets a character from a different social realm you gain the right to start rulemaking in that area. Or I could picture a big diagram of rituals and players jointly fill in some of the upper level rules at the start of the game and then later invention of specific rituals have to support those original principles. Anyway, looking forward to seeing this game.                        </div>

                            The win condition for the original Nomic rules was "roll d6 until the total is greater than or equal to 100 points." When I read that, I imagined a Nomic game that recreated the entire D&amp;D ruleset from that single d6 roll. :-)  The leap from "roll d6" to "roll d20 vs someone's AC to earn 100 XP" is not that far!                        </div>

I like the idea of each character having their own sort of domain, in which they can influence the rules and setting. I picture the character sheet being a web with your name and domain in the center, and the other characters with their domains around it, showing your relationships.<br/><br/>I imagine being able to get tokens in other peoples domains somehow which would be put on that person's spot in your web, but I'm not sure how you'd recieve them, or whether they'd be used to veto things or just to add things.                        </div>

                            Chris P.: The MUSH Nomic was just a Nomic on a MUSH with no defined purpose. I fear that my descriptions of it to my friends somehow made them think its purpose was to build an RP ruleset or MUSH game rather than just to enjoy Nomic. I was happy to let players turn the MUSH into that project by introducing rules to make it so, but that didn't happen.<br/><br/>Peter Suber's Nomic does have a winning condition. The MUSH Nomic did not use that ruleset; it used Pure Nomic, which has only the one rule and no winning condition. We eventually introduced our own winning condition that let the winner become Emperor for a short time and write one law that didn't need votes to pass.<br/><br/>Chris G.: I haven't seen many Nomic games <i>at all</i> that haven't petered out due to lack of interest. The AgoraNomics of the world are rare gems. The fact the the MUSH Nomic (NoMUSH, it was called) lasted 3-4 months and hundreds of rules was a pretty cool thing, in my mind.                        </div>

                            Instead of implicitly using Nomic to generate a ruleset outside of actual play, why not use the Nomic to handle actual play, and generate a ruleset as a side-effect?<br/><br/>For example, Adam's first rule might be "I am an elven fighter named Goldenwind Happypants. My magic is reknowned and my sword is deadly. I have ears that are 12 inches long." Let's say it passes. Bob might then propose a rule, "There is a large dragon attacking Goldenwind. It kills him." Everyone but Bob and Denise votesagainst it. Denise hates long-eared elves. Chris proposes a rule, "Characters have hit points. When you create a new character, you must specify how many hit points it has, or default to 6 hit points. Characters with less than 1 hit point are dead." It passes. Denise proposes a rule, "I am a dwarven warrior named Grognard Deepstone. I hate elves, especially long-eared elves. I have an axe that does 10 hit points of damage when it hits." Despite including the implicit definition of "damage" as a concept, the rule passes. Ellen proposes a rule, "Grognard hit Goldenwind with his axe." It passes. There's some discussion about what this means. Did this kill Goldenwind as the combination of rules imply that Goldenwind has -4 hit points (6 default minus 10 damage)? No, the ruling is that Goldenwind has 6 hit points and 10 damage hit points. It's Frank's turn, and he makes a rule, "If damage exceeds hit points, a character dies. The following is added to the text of the rule that created the character: 'The character is dead and may not be mentioned in new rules. All existing rules that mention the character by name are considered void.'" It passes.<br/><br/>I think the addition of some actual play creates a concrete test bed for play, plus a fun little game in itself.                        </div>

                            Mind you, under most versions of Nomic, you'd probably have to vote. Pure Nomic doesn't give you voting tools; you have to invent them yourselves. They're surprisingly difficult to get right, too.                        </div>
