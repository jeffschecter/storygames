Hey, if you make camp in the dungeon while chasing someone, expect them to get away.<br/><br/>So, I figure a canny operator like this chap has a buyer all laid up, and where do you go to broker deals for wonders and items of legend?  The Great Souk of the fabled City of Brass, of course!  So that's the next dungeon.  But I need some evocative custom moves.  And maybe a Tony Dowler map <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>My starters for 10+:  Wanted some sort of Gold To Barter Equivalent, but then figured the gold price comes from fiction, Haggle is the spend.<br/><br/><b>When you enter the Great Souk for the first time</b>, hold 1 Haggle<br/><br/>Also need some means of gaining more Haggle?<br/><br/>When you <b>reject a never-to-be-repeated deal</b>, gain and hold +1 Haggle<br/><br/><b>When you bargain for a small wonder</b> in the Great Souk, roll +Haggle spent.  <br/>10+ You get what you bargain for at a keen price, but choose 3<br/>7-9 choose 1:<br/>It doesn't crumble to dust, vanish while you aren't looking, or fly off on its own<br/>No-one powerful wants it back<br/>What you buy is not dangerous, deceptive or a threat.<br/>Great deal!

Also suggestions for any captivating small wonders (for an Evil Elven Fighter, a twigs-in-hair Ranger, a the-Song-is-the-thing! Bard and a no-it's-the-gold-stupid! halfling thief).

The wish move needs to be reverse, with correct wording getting harder (and the Fates getting stingier) with multiple wishes, but thats mostly just rearranging.  And while the package deals give some more options, I think each Wish deserves its own roll...<br/><br/>When you <b>cash in a Wish with an Efreeti</b>, roll + number of Wishes you have ever made, including this one.

Nothing annoys the Efreeti more, however.<br/><br/>I like the <b>word of your failures</b> idea.  Sort of a start-of-session letter move, and I know who would be dispatching aid.

This might be to request a Wish, to undo a deal made, or to provide information.</blockquote>\nWhen you bring a petition to the Keeper of the Everburning Flame, roll+favor with him and then lose all favor. On a 10+, he'll complete your request as best he can, but it'll take one of (MC's choice) time, money, or effort on your part. On a 7-9, you'll need to earn more favor with the Keeper, but he'll do it (as per a 10+). On a miss, he's so angered with you wasting his time that he has his guards take you away - he'll burn you alive or devise some other suitable punishment, when he gets around to it.<br/><br/>When you haggle with the Keeper of the Everburning Flame over some minor detail or good, roll+haggle spent. On a 10+, he's pleased with your bartering skill! Gain 1 favor with him (max 3). On a 7-9, he's amused at your effort and you take +1-forward with him.<br/><br/>When you try to curry favor with someone important, the DMC will list 2 or 3 good ways to do so. If you complete one of them, take +1-favor (max 3). Some people, like the Keeper of the Everburning Flame, also have other ways to gain their favor.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cneph</cite>I think we'll need to know what occurs<b>when take something that does not belong to you</b>or similar.</blockquote>\nWhen you take something that does not belong to you, if anyone could've possibly seen or heard you, well, it's your problem, buddy. If you think you're in the clear, roll+dex anyway. On a 10+, you are, in fact, in the clear, at least until the guy you took it from goes for it. On a 7-9, choose one:<br/>  - Someone saw you.<br/>  - Someone heard you.<br/>  - You left something behind.<br/><br/>  On a miss, all three, sucker.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Cneph</cite>And also, what happens<b>when you look into the Eye of Erethrax</b>?</blockquote>\nWhen you gaze upon the Eye of Erethrax, roll+cha. On a 10+, you feel ill will, but nothing else. On a 7-9, or a miss, choose one:<br/>  - You feel a great urge to destroy the eye.<br/>  - You move one alignment step closer to evil (good to neutral, neutral to evil). If you don't have the appropriate alignment listed in your class, the DMC will describe. If you're already evil, don't mark this one.<br/>  - You feel a great hatred of elvenkind. When you next act against an elf, take +1 against them and mark XP.<br/><br/>When you destroy the Eye of Erethrax, permanently lose 2d4 hit points (minimum hit points equal to your level or con score, whichever is higher) and take +1-forward when interacting with elves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349625/#Comment_349625" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T11:11:34+00:00" title="November 24, 2011 11:11AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Off topic aside - reading a book about Timbuktu, I learned that the city of brass was inspired by a real place.
