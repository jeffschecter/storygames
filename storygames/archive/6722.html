We had a group of three: myself, and two others, and we got to play with some of our Second Life coded object toys to help assist play.<br/><br/>We used Second Life voice and some in-world dice that actually "roll" - they bounce against each other using the Havok III Physics Engine and come up with some pretty good randomness as a result and we had some coded Fate Chips that could be "spent."<br/><br/>It was a little annoying getting all the little bits together- took about an hour to make everything work with each other. But once that was done, we were off and running.<br/><br/>The scene we had went well, and it bodes well for the next time we're going to play. At one point Second Life had a bit of a problem with its code database and so we couldn't quite use the fate chips, but that's OK - I just kept track of what had or hadn't been spent separately.<br/><br/>Now, I was trying to keep it simple at first, but SL offers a few things that don't appear on other shared gaming spaces: I can pipe music to my game through Shoutcast, I can bring up a web page and display it on the massive video screen, I can use in-world graphics. <br/><br/>As a visual aid I had the FATE Ladder on a "sign" that was easy for the players to see. <br/><br/>Two of us dressed in Pulp-style costume, which was fun but not required.<br/><br/>I still think tabletop via SL is viable, but I would *love* to see how it does as a virtual LARP.<br/><br/>I took the advice of several worthy people and created all the SotC characters ahead of time except for the four guest-star aspects each character has. That gave the players something to "make their own" and "show their flags."<br/><br/>I could've continued for some time, but we were already 30 minutes over time.<br/><br/>I could not have done this without the support of SL resident Allen Kerensky, who provided the space and helped code up the chips.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
