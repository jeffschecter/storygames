What makes a role-playing book excellent?<br/><br/>What I'd like you to do is name <i>three</i> gaming books - no more! - that, for you, in some way or other, are excellent. Not in the Bill and Ted meaning of "excellent", but meaning "of the <i>highest quality</i>". <br/><br/>Define for us, and for yourself, what fields the books excel in. Perhaps you think book X has the best editing ever seen in a gaming product. Or book Y has the most evocative art.<br/><br/><b>Here's an example of the type of posts I'd like to see:</b><br/><br/><b>Book A.</b> The system has been polished to a gleam, and years of testing have shown that it can handle the most extreme cases.<br/><b>Book B.</b> The artwork, the page design, the typography - they all form a unified whole that takes the book to a higher level.<br/><b>Book C.</b> The author's voice, witty and irreverent, speaks directly to the reader in a way no other gaming text I've ever seen.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116632/#Comment_116632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T14:14:05+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  2:14PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2007 2:14PM by Matthijs.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Skyrealms of Jorune</b> for its art. The artwork is unlike anything I've ever seen in other games. The mixture between classical references and alien life-forms, the anatomical detail, the textures all help actually bringing the vision to life. The artist Miles Teves said a while back that he'd never be able to draw like that again: The technique he used was apparently a great strain on his hands, and his work on Jorune was very much a labor of love.<br/><br/><b>Ars Magica, 2. edition</b>. Brevity balanced with completeness, rules innovation balanced with rules practicality, myth balanced with history; this book is lean and strong and ready to run when you touch it. I find it hard to define the field of excellence - balance of elements, perhaps? Concise completeness?<br/><br/><b>Prime Time Adventures</b> for its play procedures. With extreme sanity, the book gives simple and clear instructions for procedures that provide good, supportive, creative group play. Everything is transparent. With very few rules, the game transforms the gaming group's behavior in unforeseen ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116636/#Comment_116636" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T14:22:16+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  2:22PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Dust Devils Revenged.</b>  Refined, with a clarity of purpose and years of experience informing each rule and suggestion.

It truly engages the reader in a pseudo-dialogue (psuedo, since it's still one-way communication) and engages serious thought about what's said.  In some ways, it takes the fact that game knowledge is passed on often orally rather than written (as in con games or teaching your friends who don't read the book) and uses that as a strength rather than a weakness.<br/><br/><strong>Don't Rest Your Head</strong> is excellence in design incarnate, and I'm not just blowing smoke up Fred's ass here.  Combining player-empowerment, a consequence axis separate from success and failure, and very light GM responsibilities has left it feeling like the RPG equivalent of a car that has been stripped of everything unnecessarily to make it faster and more efficient.<br/><br/><strong>Polaris</strong> has some of the most beautiful imagery of any game I've read, next to perhaps <em>Nobilis</em>.  When someone says games can't be Art, I hold Polaris (and, yes, Nobilis, but I'm only suppose to choose three here) as the counter-example -- not just as a game or as art, but as a game that is bettered rather than hindered because of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116643/#Comment_116643" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T14:38:04+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  2:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Is that what you want, Matthijs?</blockquote>\nThat's great, Jason!<br/><br/>Something to bear in mind for everyone in this thread: If someone else has already posted about a game you wanted to post about - do so anyway. <i>Resist the temptation</i> to be original, to try to think of games nobody else has brought up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116647/#Comment_116647" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T15:07:13+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  3:07PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2007 3:07PM by Mike_Sands.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b>, for the absolute clarity of instruction in how to play the game mainly.

Rich, dense, evocative art, excellent organization, the whole thing feels like it's worth every penny.<br/><br/><i>Burning Empires</i>, both for production values (approaching D&amp;D3's level of page-by-page richness, except for the binding on early editions) as well as the sheer scope (audacity?) of vision within the rules.

All the pieces feed into each other and are fed by each other. and the art evokes the setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nTSR Conan RPG (1985 ed) - Innovative design, great art, exploited the setting to the fullest. Simple, useful rules.

Everything that Ryan said, plus I'll add that the text really feels (inasmuch as it can given I've never met the guy) like Vincent's having a couple of beers with you and explaining the whole thing.<br/><br/><b>Shadow of Yesterday:</b> Beautifully crystal-clear text for how-to-play information. The game goes step by step and explains itself all along the way, giving you all the tools you need to use the game for maximum awesome. The writing is cheerful, reassuring and uncluttered. Also, the setting info is full of evocative flavor, really conjuring the feel of the World of Near and getting you (well, me anyway) jazzed about playing in the world without going overboard. Every bit of flavor text-especially the Zaru introduction that ends "I would break the world"--just fills me with a burning desire to read them aloud to every gamer I know.<br/><br/>Oh, and the actual game rules rock too. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>Paranoia:</b> I think it was 1st or 2nd Edition I read, but never owned, alas! Anyway, this game is the absolute King (I can only hope that recent editions are continuing the tradition) of conveying the tone and color of a game through its text, teaching the <i>mindset</i> for play by simply staying in character (the miniseries by Adventure Comics is great for this too). <span style="color: #0033FF;">Stuff like the blurb deep in the restricted GM section where the computer chimes in, "Enjoying the read, citizen? Good, gooood. REPORT FOR TERMINATION!!" helped me grok what the game is "about," and gave me a great desire to play, but a satisfying experience just reading, too.</span> Uh, not that I would know, friend citizen. I meant hypothetically. And you don't have Blue clearance, so what were you doing reading that sentence anyway?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118131/#Comment_118131" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T21:28:10+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  9:28PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Polaris</b>, for physical product as well as solid writing. The single blue page at the very front of the book, the paper quality, the illustrations, the layout all contribute to a simple elegance. The Moments Frozen in Time is a brilliant way of promising something. The rest of the book delivers it. I love Ben's writing voice (which differs from his internet preaching voice, which I very much dislike).<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b>, for clarity of writing. The book's writing style confused me and broke me at first. At once point Vincent says something to the tune of "I don't know, I'm just making stuff up!" My mind reeled as I realized that he was presenting things in a conversational, straight-forward, human way. It felt like a conversation and a form of real communication. The Initiations is a simple way of introducing a fairly complicated die system (because the base mechanics ARE fairly complex, when you imagine them as written by someone else). Dogs is simple, concise, compact, and inviting. And yet it's got such a wide scope and range of possibility.<br/><br/><b>Covenant</b>, for the character sheet as well as Conventions/Motifs. The character sheet has a relationship map in the middle. The entire page is designed so that things move outward from the relationship map, so that you can pick any random NPC and see how they tie into the world and the mechanics. There's also rules summary right there, meaning you don't need to look anything up. The sheet is brilliant. The other brilliant bit is Conventions/Motifs, which immediately brings the setting into the game and into the mechanics, as well as ensuring that the things which are recurring are recurring because the players WANT them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
