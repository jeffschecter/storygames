So you'd have to probably make your game into a horror-fantasy game or something.<br/><br/>I recall that in vanilla Fudge, Mike Gentry wanted to simulate "Sanity" from CoC but the Fudge levels just weren't grainy enough for him. So he grafted the whole damn CoC system on to Fudge, complete with rolling non-fudge dice for San damage.  I later used the same thing in a Delta Green Fudge game. It worked great for him. The above may work great for you!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Discordian" title="Discordian"><img alt="Discordian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Discordian">Discordian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76883/#Comment_76883" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T03:52:53+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  3:52AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'd do it with Keys, myself.

Our goal would be to make violence a thing that matters after playing Conanish tsoy (where heads roll regularily!). Also, it is preference of one of the players that the general bodycount would be smaller. So, how about these:<br/><br/>The default key that everyone gets for free:<br/><b> Key of Humanity </b><br/><i> Character is mentally healthy human</i><br/>1XP when trying to avoid doing harm.<br/>2XP when trying to avoid violent situation.<br/>5XP when unable to commit violence even when not doing so is mortally dangerous.<br/><b>Buyoff:</b> Doing serious intentional harm to others and then rationalizing this away..<br/><br/><br/>And some that you might trade it for<br/><br/><b>Key of Sociopath</b><br/><i> An individual with no superego or conscience, impulsive, destructive.. </i><br/>1XP when people notice that terror and violence is everyday for the character.<br/>2XP when people shun the character for his psychotic behaviour.<br/>5XP when character is shut from the society.<br/><b>Buyoff:</b> Intensive and extensive therapy.<br/><br/><br/>Or something bit less..<br/><b>Key of Callousness</b><br/><i>Character is cold-blooded and indurate to public opinion</i><br/>1XP when exhibiting cold-hearted behaviour,<br/>2XP when you are beeing denied comfort for beeing callous.<br/>5XP when ruthlessly sacrifice someone dear to you for your goals.<br/><b>Buyoff:</b> Hurt someone close to you and come to regret it.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>Maybe a Key that the advances went solely into a Pool of Madness. The Madness Pool could be used to replace (Sway with Madness this time instead of Reason) and to fuel Secrets.<br/></blockquote>\n(Going a bit off topic here but..)<br/>Oh wow. This is cool! Though term "Madness" is bit too general and not exactly what I want to see. How would you like:<br/><br/><b>Secret of Black Hatred</b><br/>The character has nurtured his deep hatred so long that now it lights his way. Character has a Hatred Pool, which starts at 1 and can be further advanced. Whenever committing acts of out of rage and hatred he can take a bonus dice from his Hatred Pool, in addition to other pools.<br/><br/><b>Secret of Longing</b><br/>The character has met sweet sorrows in his life, lost things precious and enjoyed things nevermore to be had. This drives him onwards with delicate grief. Character has a pool called Grief which starts at 1 and can advance normally. Whenever committing acts of art or passion, character can take a bonus die from her Grief Pool in addition to other pools.<br/>(Otherwise know as the Emo-elf-secret)<br/><br/><b>Secret of Mythos</b><br/>The character has glimpsed beyong the veil of reality seeing the the face of God, and the horrible abominations risen to eat His corpse.  This madness gives him unearthly insights and magic. Things that seem random now make a pattern and probabilities are divined.. Character has a Mythos/Madness pool which starts at 1 and can advance normally. Whenever he likes, he can tap his forbidden wisdom and take a bonus dice in addition to other pools.<br/><br/>Refreshes could be.. Interesting.. I can probably think of dozens of keys and secrets to go with these..<br/><br/>(I'm stealing from abzu again <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
