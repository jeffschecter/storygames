I ran two demos each of <i>Faery's Tale </i>&amp; our upcoming new edition of <i>Og </i>in the young players room (plus <i>Monster Island</i>, but that's not much of a story game, unless Rawr! Smash! is a story). I had a suprisingly good time considering that I was very unexcited about going - it's the last of my spring series of local shows, so I'm burning out a little, I think. But, not to brag on myself here, seeing how much kids and parents enjoyed the games (especially <i>Faery's Tale</i>) was really great. In fact, it was the first RPG experience for most of the kids - one dad had me sign &amp; date the back of his son's sprite character sheet as a memento. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I also dropped in on a <i>Faery's Tale </i>game that someone else - whom I didn't even know - was running for a group of adults after I spotted it on the schedule. I couldn't stay long as I had to drive home that night, but they seemed to be having fun - I came in during some kind of battle with cats &amp; dark faeries.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can post an actual play on one of the <i>Og </i>games that was particularly funny if folks are interested. The first <i>Faery's Tale</i> game was a pretty standard run-through of our <i>Tournament of the Fey </i>free intro pack adventure, and the second was a new adventure I put together Saturday night. But it was with a large group of kids, several of whom got majorly into the rules for adding complications &amp; buying plot twists, so it went off the rails very quickly from my point of view. The kids seemed to have a fun time, and their ideas were great, but not when they are all yelling thirty different changes to every scene at me at once. "Oh, I want to have a dragon appear to fight us, can I get an Essence for adding a complication?" "I want to buy a plot twist that it's a friendly dragon!" "No, I buy a plot twist that a kraken comes up from the river and attacks the dragon instead." "I want a plot twist that the dragon and kraken are friends and both attack us!" And so forth. Especially since I try not to say no if at all possible.

Actually, a mix of actual play, designer notes, &amp; analysis.<br/><br/>This is a new edition of the classic comedy caveman game from Wingnut Games, which I kind of consider a prehistoric indie game - narrow focus, offbeat topic, with some innovative twist or gimmick in the rules - written by Robin Laws. The big thing in <i>Og</i>, for those who are unfamiliar, is limited vocabulary ... you start play with 1d6+3 words from a list of 18 words, like you, me, fire, sleep, rock, etc. You try to do things, fail a lot, argue incoherently using your handful of words, and funny stuff happens. The new edition will be out in PDF in July and print in August.<br/><br/>I ran two demos in the younger players room. The first one didn't go so well, at least from my point of view, though the kids seemed to have a good time. I had a big group of younger kids, and since young kids already have trouble communicating, that part of the game was kind of lost on them - they just kept yelling 'Fire' and 'Sleep' and so forth at each other, which is a hilarious interlude for adults, and fun for kids, but doesn't do much for the 'story' part of a story game. Second, I tried a new idea for an adventure, doing a comedy version of 'Quest for Fire.' But the kids had a hard time conceptualizing how or where to go look for fire, so it was tough to keep the adventure moving. Finally, I tried having the players pick their cavemen's abilities (skills) in play, but that actually created more problems as nobody knew what their caveman could do, which left them at a loss as to what to try. Again, what is flexibility for adults is actually limiting for kids - too many choices. So at that point I was kind of discouraged &amp; thinking that trying to run <i>Og </i>in the young players room was a mistake.<br/><br/>Then, my Sunday game rolled around. I had a smaller group, 6 players consisting of an older girl, two moms, a younger girl (there with her mom), and two younger boys (one with his mom, one with a non-playing but helping dad). This game went MUCH better. I ditched the fire idea and went back to my old <i>Og </i>playtest standby - you wake up, everyone's hungry, and there's no food in the cave. The kids were able to grasp that problem &amp; possible solutions much more easily. I also had everyone pick abilities before play so the kids had a better grasp of what their cavemen might or might not be good at trying. Of course, having the parents there - and playing alongside the kids - made everything much smoother, too. Finally, I did a better job of asking leading questions &amp;, after letting them yuk it up in a scene with trying to communicate with their few words, grunting, and gestures, moving things along by saing things like "OK, it sounds like everyone wants to do X, is that right?" which eliminated the need for the "conversation" to actually come to a concrete resolution (almost impossible given the ages &amp; communication &amp; attention problems even without those imposed by the game).<br/><br/>Whew! OK, sorry for the long analysis but I found it an interesting process over the weekend. Now the actual play I promised. This will be a lot funnier. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So, cavegirls Gerk, Meha, Cron &amp; Ugug and cavemen Ugga &amp; Gark wake up in their clan's cave. Everyone's hungry &amp; there's no food in the cave. Since they are the geniuses of their clan, everyone looks to them to solve the problem. After talking it over - "Go food?" "You go food!" "Me?" "Food!" - they head out of the cave. Ugga predicts rain, then changes his mind and predicts a hot day - "Fire!" pointing at the sky. They head off onto the prehistoric savannah.<br/><br/>At this point, I asked what kind of food they wanted to look for. Ugga wanted a turkey, so he spotted a prehistoric flightless bird. Cron and Gark wanted to fish - "Water food" - so they wandered off toward the river. Gerk wanted coconuts, but missed her foraging roll and climbed the wrong tree. Ugga jumped on the bird, but it wriggled free, and he &amp; Meha chased it around for awhile. Cron catches a fish but Gark rolls a 1 &amp; forgets how to fish properly, jumping into the river instead (fortunately, he manages to swim back to shore). Gerk jumps across to the coconut tree, but at her player's suggestion, a coconut shakes loose, falls &amp; hits her on the head, and she falls to the ground. She keeps the coconut. Meha and Ugga manage to finally knock over the bird.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ugug's player wanted to hunt a dinosaur (yes, dinos &amp; cavemen co-exist in <i>Og</i>, it's a comedy game). Well, this was kind of a challenge because dinosaurs, while anachronistic, are somewhat realistic in that they are built to be almost impossible for cavemen to kill (it's not a mistake that every PC has the ability 'Run Away' for free. In <i>Og</i>, if you don't know how to run away, you are already extinct &amp; ineligible for PC-dom.) So I was interested to see where this one would go. Ugug spots a brontosaurus - yeah, they got renamed, sue us <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> - sneaks up on it, and lights a fire under its tail. "And it cooks!" announces her player.<br/><br/>Well, instead I said the brontosaur got panicked by the hotfoot and ran off into the jungle ... and over a cliff. So now the cave people have a huge pile of dino meat ... at the bottom of a cliff. The cavepeople come together again to figure out what to do. Ugug &amp; Gerk, who know how to build (invent) things, successfully invent the ladder to get down the cliff. The player of Ugga, who's very strong, announces he will go down and throw the dinosaur up the cliff (and is not dissuaded by the dismayed but incoherent arguments of the other cavemen). So, that plan doesn't work out so well, but Ugga manages not to get squashed, at least. Then the cavepeople, after much grunting &amp; gesturing, decide to build a giant net, roll the brontosaur into it, then pull it up the cliff.<br/><br/>(Yeah, still not very realistic, but hey, at least it was more plausible than throwing it up the cliff, so I was prepared to let it go - on the assumption that at least some folks would miss their rolls &amp; provide me with a chance for more comedy as they get dragged over the cliff or something)<br/><br/>So they manage to build the net out of vines &amp; roll the brontosaur onto it. Except Gerk's player rolls a 1, so she 'forgets how' and tries helping from the wrong side of the dinosaur, which rolls on top of her. Ugga, the strong guy, lifts the dinosaur up just enough for the others to drag Gerk back out. Then the cavepeople inexplicably decide to cook the dinosaur where it is rather than carrying out the rest of the plan. So they feast on the dinosaur.<br/><br/>At this point, we'd been playing for just over an hour, so I asked if the kids wanted something else to happen, or if they just wanted to go back to the cave with the rest of the meat. They voted for 'something else happens,' so I said a tribe of monkey men (missing links, like the start of <i>2001</i>) smells the cooking meat &amp; shows up at the top of the cliff.<br/><br/>Much ook-ooking and caveman shouts of "smelly hairy" later, the cave people try to intimidate the monkey men. Two succeed, but two botch - dropping their clubs on their heads - so half the monkey men flee but the other half are emboldened. So Gerk (or maybe Ugug) comes up with a plan - they will make decoy meat by wrapping rocks in leaves &amp; offering it to the monkey men with much groveling in fear (while hiding the real meat under their skins). The monkey men fall for the ruse &amp; accept the offering, breaking their teeth on the rocks when they go to devour the 'meat' as the cavemen and cavegirls hightail it back to their cave with the rest of the dinosaur meat. And the clan survives another day thanks to our heroes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Firefly%20Games" title="Firefly Games"><img alt="Firefly Games" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Firefly%20Games">Firefly Games</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72273/#Comment_72273" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T23:42:48+00:00" title="May 28, 2007 11:42PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2007 12:02AM by Firefly Games.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caesar X also asked about the avalanche of plot twists in the Sunday <i>Faery's Tale</i> game at the show. In <i>Faery's Tale</i>, you can buy plot twists to favor your faeries using your Essence - life points, mana pool, &amp; drama points all in one. Or you can suggest complications that, if adopted, earn your faery Essence. I put these into the game for two reasons. First, <i>Faery's Tale </i>is designed to be playable with kids, who are going to be calling out ideas or trying to narrate the story themselves anyway, so rather than treat it as a problem, why not build it into the rules? Second, it <i>is</i> a game about faeries, who are all about altering reality and breaking the rules. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But it went kind of haywire in this game. I had 8-10 players, which is too many, really, but I have a hard time turning away kids who want to play. Only a couple were there with a parent, and several were older kids. Also, I felt that I'd done a poor job of explaining the plot twist rules Saturday so, while that was an excellent session, nobody really got to try out that part of the game. So I emphasized the plot twist &amp; complication rules in the Sunday and, as I said, several of the players - first an older pair of sisters, then pretty much everyone - took that part of the game &amp; ran with it.<br/><br/>Now, I wrote the rules, &amp; I've been playtesting &amp; demoing <i>Faery's Tale </i>for something like 18 months now, so I am not bad at incorporating suggestions into the stories on the fly, "not saying no," and so forth. But the sheer volume of the plot twists coming in defeated me.<br/><br/>First, it was simply a management problem with too big a group, especially for playing with kids - I'd no sooner start describing a scene than the kids would start calling out "I want to buy a plot twist to make it so ...", then other kids would want to buy plot twists or add complications to negate the first idea, and so forth. Even trying to get them to go in order around the table didn't work. Second, as I said, my inability to control the table led to bidding wars on changes &amp; reversions &amp; changes again (before I could even rule on the first suggestions, they were already several rounds into making counter-suggestions &amp; counter-counter-suggestions). Even if I said 'no' to 90% of them - which I hate to do - I'd still be dealing with 3 or 4 often contradictory plot twists to every scene.<br/><br/>(I realize that for some story games, taking control of the narrative, bidding on plot twists, &amp; so forth <b>are</b> the game, but in <i>Faery's Tale </i>they are more of an added element, not the entire game - not intended derisively to those other games, just to say, it's not expected to dominate the session in <b>this </b>game.)<br/><br/>So trying to keep the adventure on track - not going where I wanted it to go, necessarily, but at least going <b>somewhere</b> toward a resolution - was very, very difficult.<br/><br/>Also, the Essence economy is supposed to regulate things a bit - if you spend too much Essence buying plot twists &amp; outstrip your ability to earn Essence back, well, you run out of Essence &amp; have to stop eventually. But that regulator broke with so many kids taking part, because their collective Essence pool to draw from was huge.<br/><br/>Now, I know I am being over-critical here. There were actually several parts of the adventure where I had a lot of fun running the game. After my original idea of a haunted bog got blown away by an avalanche of plot twists - "I want them to be friendly ghosts." "Maybe some bees come &amp; sting the ghosts &amp; chase them away." "No, I <b>said </b>they were friendly ghosts!" - a brownie built a bridge across the bog so the faeries could cross. One of the kids suggested that a shark could attack the bridge. I suggested an alligator, but someone else proposed a kraken, which I turned into just a weird tentacle beast in the murky water. So the brownie &amp; a pixie used magic to hold the collapsing bridge together, while the sprites jumped on their insect &amp; bird steeds to attack the tentacles, and I think another pixie (there were something like 5) used pixie dust to turn one tentacle into calamari. So they drove off the tentacle creature in the end, which was a fun, exciting, &amp; memorable scene that was completely different from what I'd intended. And we did manage to more or less reach a successful conclusion, though I had to hurry the trip back with the item they were questing after because time was almost up &amp; the kids kept wanting to suggest more things to attack them on the way home.<br/><br/>So I guess they enjoyed it, even if it was a bit too much like herding cats to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
