I've been watching some APs and am curious about some aspects of how to run it.<br/><br/>When "groundskeeping" a game, how does one plan the rooms?  Are the rooms prepared in advance?  The AP's I've seen seem like there was probably some prep going on. What does this do to player choice?  How does their selection of keys impact the rooms they go to?  It seems sort of like it doesn't.  It seems like the rooms are just "redecorated" a little to match the key described by the sister.  Or maybe there's no prep, just really good GMs.<br/><br/>Does the "truth" about a room proposed by a sister during an Exit move have to be "correct"?  In other words, does the groundskeeper decide what the room is and what it means and the bride has to get it right?  Does a room even have an objective "truth"?  Or is the truth stated by the bride just something that has meaning to the bride and her experience in the room and thus is always correct?<br/><br/>Does a shattered sister ever get the ring?  What if the ring has to move and shattered sisters are all that are left?<br/><br/>In another thread, <a href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">@AnonAdderlan</a> was asking about the role of a shattered sister as an ally of the Groundskeeper.  How does that work exactly?<br/><br/>And <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> asked about mechanics that support the Bride's denial of Bluebeard's nature.  We talked about how taking tokens heals or adds to trauma when exiting rooms.  Is there more?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458004/#Comment_458004" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-09T17:22:53+00:00" title="November  9, 2016  5:22PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd suggest hitting up the Magpie Games g+ community to ask this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_458007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458007/#Comment_458007" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-09T22:52:00+00:00" title="November  9, 2016 10:52PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does the "truth" about a room proposed by a sister during an Exit move have to be "correct"?
