There are entire campaigns online, hundreds of hours that people are watching religiously, tuning in live every week. D&amp;D is in the spotlight in so many ways - we have celebrities endorsing it, it appears on popular TV shows like <i>Stranger Things</i>, and there's even something on YouTube called "CelebriD&amp;D", where famous actors play D&amp;D in short segments.<br/><br/>It seems this is really something huge. There are second-party videos reviewing moments in the game which are 30 minutes long and have been watched close to a million times. Commenters say they cried when something sad happened in the game, and are planning to <i>rewatch</i> all 400+ hours of gameplay.<br/><br/>Here's a short interview which talks a little bit about the genesis of <i>Critical Role</i> and its impact:<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-D6uyq9xzI1Q?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6uyq9xzI1Q"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/D6uyq9xzI1Q/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>This is all news to me, and I find myself feeling really ambivalent about it.<br/><br/>On one hand, people have been crowing about the Death of Roleplaying for a number of decades. It's nice to see the lie put to that particular mindset. Between the OSR movement, creator-produced new RPGs, the renaissance of boardgames, and now the resurgence of D&amp;D, tabletop gaming seems very much alive and well. Indeed, it is far more so than I thought!<br/><br/>In my city, boardgame cafes are one of the most successful businesses going, and they're now opening up in every part of town, like mushrooms sprouting along major streets. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I watched a bit of <i>Critical Role</i>, and I'm a little disappointed by the style of play. It's exactly what I remember of D&amp;D from when I was a teenager, and what a lot of people interested in "story games" were turned off by. People display incredible skill in colourful descriptions, voice acting, and rule mastery. However, it's also full of all the genre tropes, gamer cliches, and counterproductive practices that largely drove me away from D&amp;D in the first place.<br/><br/>For instance, the first session of <i>Critical Role</i> (a game made by and for a mature audience) even has a "let's go to the brothel, pay for sex, and roll Constitution to see how well we did it!" scene. <br/><br/>The DM of the game made a video talking about how to deal with "Player Death" (let's be charitable and assume he meant "character death"). He discusses how difficult and undesireable that can be in a long campaign, but that it's a reality which must be considered, and then described techniques for helping players "get over it". I would have thought that in 2017 a scripted and carefully-considered video about "player death" (ha!) would at least mention the possibility of addressing it via design or gameplay practices, instead of handling it like a dangerous scourge which, like gun crime, alas, isn't wanted but can't always be presented. Not a terribly aware point of view, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I suppose it's a selfish fear of mine that's rearing its ugly head. If millions of people are admiring this kind of roleplaying as the apotheosis of gaming... will the hobby once again be dominated by Illusionist D&amp;D play? Do people look at their favourite celebrities playing D&amp;D and dream of one day gaming in that same style?<br/><br/>I don't know.<br/><br/>What do you think? What are your thoughts, reactions? Is this really a big trend or movement, and how is it affecting the gaming scene?<br/><br/>Are you a fan or <i>Critical Role</i>, or do you know people who are? What is your (or their) relationship to such a form of entertainment?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467701/#Comment_467701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T20:16:21+00:00" title="November 15, 2017  8:16PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried to watch one of these for a bit a while back (by an American comedian... Harmonquest is its name, I think?), but couldn't quite get beyond the first episode. I can see how it would work better for somebody who doesn't practice the form themselves, as the perspective would be sufficiently external. For a gamer - or at least for me - all the attention is in the technicalities of what they're doing (not particular luminaries of the form, let's say), and any showcasing of game culture comes off as unnecessary simplification or pandering to cliches.<br/><br/>I'll note that this phenomenon is likely part and parcel of the direction that popular entertainment has been taking ever since reality tv became a big thing. Watching other people play roleplaying games probably works pretty much by the same logic as watching other people play video games: it's raw, undramatized, low-tension content where you don't need to pay constant attention to every dramatic beat, because it's not orchestrated to be understood that way in the first place. If it's anything like when I watch other people play video games, there's a certain exoticism factor: you want to watch other people do things you specifically don't do yourself, because it's a quick and easy way to learn about that other craft.<br/><br/>As an interesting comparison, consider the way European musical tradition has evolved over the last 300 years or so: we started in a situation where music was appreciated for creating enveloping sound mats, with long performances that develop themes slowly and generally work well as background music, or music to meditate by. Going forward we see a development towards shorter, more dramatized forms, until in the modern day the basic unit of music is the "song", a succinct 2-3 minute piece. It's a bit like music has been trending to the opposite direction, while narrative art has recently found the technique of rambling like a Baroque orchestra piece: instead of reading a relatively punchy story, you sit and watch 10 hours of somebody playing a slow-paced rpg. An interesting development, that.<br/><br/>But I guess that's just me musing on why people would want to watch other people play roleplaying games. Regarding your value concerns, I'm not really bothered myself; this phenomenon might bring some more people into roleplaying, mostly D&amp;D, which is good, but it's not going to change the fact that people play what they want to, in the ways they want to. I don't think that the boring Lord of the Rings movies have ruined my enjoyment of the original novel, and neither do I think that more people getting into D&amp;D will ruin my enjoyment of roleplaying. I guess I'm fundamentally elitist about stuff like this: the hoi polloi will do its thing, but what do I care. If roleplaying were going to be ruined by bad D&amp;D, it would have already happened in light of the numbers.<br/><br/>If well-publicized play of low-quality D&amp;D really does bring a lot of people into the hobby, I would think that it'll be an excellent opportunity to show an ever wider circle of interested and comprehending people how to do neat tricks with roleplaying games. It's often said that a complete newbie is easier to train to play well than somebody exposed to bad D&amp;D, which is true as far as it goes, but it's also true that a person who's interested in improving their roleplaying is a much easier starting point than one who doesn't even know what roleplaying is. I'll be glad to take ten badly trained D&amp;D players delivered to my doorstep instead of having to hunt and convert a single newbie myself - it's less work overall in my experience, even if that newbie would be easier to deal with once I'd found them and convinced them to try the hobby.<br/><br/>Also, how about this: if playing rpgs does become some sort of a staple of the new bold Internet tv era, wouldn't it make sense that over the long term player skill will become a factor of popularity? Right now it seems that people are getting filmed mostly due to their own effort and interest in videocasting their play, which of course doesn't say much about the quality of that play. But if better play proves more popular on tv, wouldn't there be a selective pressure towards arranging to film the best? It might be that you'll find that the quality of tv play quickly improves once somebody decides to stop filming their <i>own</i> play and tries to get an actually solid group to perform. It's possible that the tv-popular playstyle will be something other than your favourite kind of roleplaying, but I imagine that it's going to be a huge improvement if the stuff they show is good in its own right, even if it's not the one true playstyle [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467704/#Comment_467704" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T20:47:16+00:00" title="November 15, 2017  8:47PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I've seen a handful of minutes of the Dan Harmon stuff, and it's quite different from this - goofy, unpretentious, a self-parody in many respects. If you take a look at the <i>Critical Role</i> material, you'll see that it's quite different. Although I have my quibbles with it, it's definitely "high quality", or at least presented as such. It's well-prepared content, delivered with a high level of skill by professional voice actors.<br/><br/>That's the source of my fear, in fact: that it's touted as the pinnacle of gaming. (If you read the comments, they are largely along the lines of "I wish I could someday be as great a GM as that guy!" or "It's my dream to one day be part of a group like this.") I think that if I were introduced to D&amp;D by watching something like this, I would likely forever try to imitate it. These people are engaging and funny and attractive and very skilled at what they do. All the things I dislike now were things which initially drew me to roleplaying - when I watch them play, even while the mature, present-day me notices things which bother me and I would never do, my first reaction is that *this is what D&amp;D is <i>supposed to be like</i>, almost like some kind of Platonic ideal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467715/#Comment_467715" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T21:50:05+00:00" title="November 15, 2017  9:50PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it's sort of like rpg porn?

Nonetheless she has taken to my (ahem) philosophically sophisticated non-illusionist OSR megadungeon campaign like a fish to water.

From what I've seen, the show does "classic D&amp;D", along with Illusionist (or, more properly, Participationist) play and a variety of D&amp;D tropes. The performance of the GM and players is certainly a part of the appeal. They are charismatic, creative, and energetic. They voice work and character portrayals are top-notch (despite not always being to my taste). I suspect that's one of the main draws (being as strong as it is). They do a great job of keeping things moving, keeping the energy high, and staying on task, as well as being funny while they do it. The humour may be the second draw.<br/><br/>The GM is knowledgeable about the rules and extremely well prepared - he has maps and miniatures and sound effects (or background sounds) which he seems to use seamlessly, almost as though it was all happening automatically and effortlessly. In fact, I'm floored by how quickly he manages to look up and track information. For instance, every time a rules question comes up, he says, "I'll look that up," and, within a few seconds, he's got the book open and has the answer, without needing to pause the game. I don't even know how that's possible, but I've only seen two instances so far where they had to pause even momentarily to look something up. (And the GM was wise enough to say, "Hey, let's keep this going, and we'll sort it out later" in one instance.)<br/><br/>From what I've read, however, it seems that the long-term development of the plot is what keeps viewers watching - they are excited to see what's behind the mysterious events and what will happen to the characters.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear what someone more familiar with the series than me thinks on this topic. What's the main draw, and what can we learn from the way this game is run?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467734/#Comment_467734" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-16T17:56:16+00:00" title="November 16, 2017  5:56PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't it a known fact that a well-run trad GM show is pretty good entertainment? My own experience with it is more that it's too much work for too little payout to bother with, than it being fundamentally difficult to achieve. Looking at it historically, it's rarely the players who really push for change in the traditional gaming set-up - usually it's the GM who wants something less GM-centric and more fundamentally interactive.<br/><br/>If one accepts that premise, then it stands to reason that adding enough of an audience will fundamentally change that creative equation: now you're not performing only for a couple of occasionally underappreciative friends, but rather to a big video audience. The job might even pay something. It doesn't look that different from any television work now, so no reason why it couldn't work: you just put in the hours to prep good sessions, choose players who can do their parts, and do it. It's sort of like improvisational theater insofar as the audience is concerned, isn't it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467736/#Comment_467736" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-16T18:14:09+00:00" title="November 16, 2017  6:14PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2017 6:44PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I agree with that, in general. (Oddly enough, though, if I were to play D&amp;D now, I'd far prefer to do as a GM than as a player, however. I find the player's role in a Participationist or Illusionist "Grand D&amp;D campaign" rather limited; not terribly interesting, creatively or tactically. I just joined one recently as an experiment, so I will update that opinion as we go along! The second session is two days away.)<br/><br/>I'm sure that most of the audience is D&amp;D players, though (or people who wish they played D&amp;D!), so enjoying the vagaries of the game is part of the fun.<br/><br/>I enjoy the roleplay-heavy scenes (for the GM's skill at creating NPC characters and the sense of a coherent world, and the players' voice work and humour), but the combat sequences get a bit slow for me - lots of rolling and counting up numbers. I think the characters are roughly low mid-level (maybe 5-8?), and in D&amp;D5E that gives them enough special powers and abilities that each round is basically the characters taking turns firing off their next special ability. While the GM's descriptions (remember, he describes *everything*, including how both sides act in combat and what attacks, misses, and special ability use looks like*) are very entertaining, the underlying fiction isn't all that interesting, and the players rarely make any fictionally-relevant decisions. (It's more about "Ok, this monster has fire resistance, so I'll use my Cold Spray spell this turn..." In other words, winning fights - which so far seems to be a given - is a consequence of applying mechanical character abilities in the right order, rather than the clever planning or dumb luck you'd see in an OSR-style game. This is fine, but a little "board gamey" for my tastes. If we were watching this in a movie, for example, we'd find it visually exciting and stimulating but very boring dramatically. Still, the ominous music, frightening monsters, and high energy at the table creates a pretty strong sense of tension, and one character did actually get taken out of commission in a fight I watched yesterday, thanks to a monster ability.)<br/><br/><br/>* The exception is the occasional "finishing blow" he allows a player to describe him or herself (but then still narrates in his own words), which is considered a huge reward. When you land the killing blow on a monster (and if it's the last monster of the encounter), the GM usually asks the player "How do you want to do this?" The whole table cheers when that happens. One player was incredibly excited when he got the chance to do so, it being his first time to earn that privilege in two years (!!!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467739/#Comment_467739" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-16T18:35:38+00:00" title="November 16, 2017  6:35PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those curious, here are a few of the comments people leave behind:\n<blockquote><br/>"I love <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23criticalrole&amp;Mode=like">#criticalrole</a> because being a grown up caused my D&amp;D group to dissemble [sic], and now I can game vicariously."<br/><br/>[Presumably they mean "disperse" or something similar.]<br/><br/>-"Wait the people in chat room was litteraly buying them food..?

They're nicely done and edited but also incredibly dated (for my sensibilities). Most of the advice is straightforward 1990's "How to be an awesome DM" and "How to provide a wonderful service for your players, who hopefully thank you later for all your work" RPG culture. I don't have a problem with that per se, but it's definitely not what I enjoy about roleplaying.

If you'll read one of those books Gygax wrote about how to be a GM, you'll find that they celebrate exactly this kind of relationship between the GM and the player base. It's all about working hard to prove yourself the rightful master of the table, and thus gaining the rightful accolades of the audience (which traditionally consists of the lesser players you perform for)<br/><br/>In that regard I guess we're witnessing a situation where the conscientious showman-GM finally gets their due in terms of accolades, thanks to the outside audience. Which is nice, because I've personally found that it was always something of an empty promise, that you could achieve artistic satisfaction and social esteem by being a "great GM". Maybe that works better in the intense club gaming environments of the '70s (where Gygax comes from), or in bigger cities, but I haven't really ever seen a GM being long-term psychologically "fed" and rewarded for hard work in a one-sided entertainment relationship by being worshiped as a "master GM" the way Gygax explains it. The best you can realistically expect in my experience is that the other players are happy to play with you, not that they'll applaud you and pay for your pizza, too [grin].<br/><br/>So yeah, I hope that works for the guy. He clearly puts a lot of work into this production.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I agree with that, in general. (Oddly enough, though, if I were to play D&amp;D now, I'd far prefer to do as a GM than as a player, however. I find the player's role in a Participationist or Illusionist "Grand D&amp;D campaign" rather limited; not terribly interesting, creatively or tactically. I just joined one recently as an experiment, so I will update that opinion as we go along! The second session is two days away.)</p></div></blockquote>\nI've been forced by circumstance to play various participationist bullshit fantasy games lately. I recommend a relaxed, ironic attitude, with lots of patience; don't try to influence the rhythm of the game, let the other players advance at their own pace. Establish your role as a planner, commentator (comic, but otherwise too) and character-roleplayer: your job is to say out loud what the party needs to do next (sort of light-handed chairmanning), to point out interesting things about the events as they proceed, and to play your character as a lively enactor of the GM's plot.<br/><br/>I've found that following this advice makes for much more palatable play than we would achieve if I was constantly being difficult about the nature of the game - neither being glumly passive-aggressive nor trying to actively do things I know the game isn't up to supporting isn't constructive in this sort of situation. It's what the crew wants to play, so let's play it seriously rather than sabotaging it. The play can in fact be genuinely entertaining when the GM has their shit together and actually has something semi-interesting to offer in e.g. literary terms. And it helps tremendously in entertaining everybody if there's somebody at the table who's self-aware enough to actively facilitate the GM's plot railroad, and to point out and appreciate the good content (assuming the GM has any).<br/><br/>Because that was sort of abstract, an example of what I mean by constructive commentary: when the GM established over a few sessions, in various ways, that our fantasy campaign was set in an average-sized client kingdom that was suffering unrest due to separatist tendencies in its western parts, I was the one who pointed out that we were apparently in modern Ukraine, in all but name. I think that we've gained a lot in thematic terms from the GM's attempts at presenting the civil war milieu over the two sessions precisely because I made note of the theme early on, and thus elevated the group's understanding of what the GM was going for. (Apparently he wasn't thinking about Ukraine himself while prepping his material, but the analogy has nevertheless been striking.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467745/#Comment_467745" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-16T20:56:52+00:00" title="November 16, 2017  8:56PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent advice, Eero.

So, like, I kind of have an appreciation over why it's so popular, despite the fact that each damn episode is at least three hours long.<br/><br/>I also have a suspicion that the reason why Matt Mercer appears so incredibly competent with regards to referencing D&amp;D rules is that part of the crew (the folks behind the camera) are very well-versed with the rules and are able to provide the DM and players with rules information <em>very</em> quickly during the live stream. Which, I think, is totally a necessity when you're trying to reach large audiences on a live medium, and completely understandable. They've got the production values, so that's fine. There's a <em>lot</em> of work that goes behind that, which helps with the accessibility, even if it is a little deceptive.<br/><br/>It's kind of funny that we're talking about Critical Role because my interest in the whole \u201cwatching people roleplay\u201d also coincided with Roll 20 offering their own let's play videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHC1kWACzA7G6D2fqkqsRDg" rel="nofollow">their channel</a> with Adam Koebbel (of the Dungeon World fame) as Dungeon Master. Adam does a fairly good job, and his selection is most definitely <em>not</em> limited to D&amp;D \u2014 I've seen him play Dungeon World (obviously), Burning Wheel, Sprawl and even old-school Mage: the Ascension (completely enough to make me realize how <em>deeply frustrating</em> that game was, system-wise).<br/><br/>And I think that's kind of the point, to me as well? While I recognize that Critical Role is a sort of ideal that is, frankly, impossible to achieve \u2014 I'm not a voice actor, I don't have production values, I <em>can't</em> bracket my work and time to do the sort of things that Matt Mercer and his crew manage to pull off \u2014 it does give me a kind of expectation to what kind of fun I'll be getting with D&amp;D and what's possible. And it's a lot!<br/><br/>I recall an earlier conversation (more an argument really) about how it's hard to figure out this whole tabletop RPG thing without <em>seeing</em> it in action. And seeing not only Critical Role (which adopts a certain kind of style that I've decided not to attempt, because I can see the amount of work it could take), but Koebbel's work in Roll 20, and even some rough work in podcasts and more informal \u201cLet's Play\u201d tabletop games I've seen on YouTube, it gives you an idea of what the experience is like. Which I appreciate. It helps that I know for a fact that Critical Role aren't the only game in town, and for their work, however seriously Illlusionist/Participationist they are, there's stuff like this, that's kind of like an antidote:<br/><br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-qQx4pNVq8Xc?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQx4pNVq8Xc"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/qQx4pNVq8Xc/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/><br/>I mean, it's a bunch of ironic hipsters mucking about with Boston accents and crab-claw swords, which is like the <em>opposite</em> of Critical Role, honestly. And it works, especially when all you've got is a local culture that's <em>really</em> wedded into <em>one</em> kind of roleplay, and all you get is second-hand reports of how it's done without the emotional nuance and experience. Heck, when I started I didn't <em>know</em> games could take three to six hours and that <em>so little</em> could be done, especially with players and GMs goofing off. Knowing that other people face this issue, <em>even in highly-professional environments</em> like Critical Role, takes the edge off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467765/#Comment_467765" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-17T13:34:04+00:00" title="November 17, 2017  1:34PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Isn't it a known fact that a well-run trad GM show is pretty good entertainment?

I think it will happen, just give it some time. Don't forget that we're on the bleeding edge of gaming here. D&amp;D has been around for almost 50 years at this point, and it's only starting to reach the mainstream. It's going to take a while before Story Games can do the same thing.

I can concentrate on improvising cool narrations because I dont really <b>have to</b> worry about the results.<br/><br/>In participationist gaming rolling is often a 'spicy roll'. The dice only determines the 'how', not the 'what'. I can roll nearly anything but the plot will go forward. With detours maybe. So I <b>shouldnt</b> worry too much about the results.<br/><br/>What I will worry about is: 'Can I maintain the concept and image of my character whatever I roll?' If the GM allows some impact on interpreting the results (giving suggestions or adding some color ... as Matt Mercer does this with natural 20s), than the situation looks very similar from a player POV.

You are just trying to guess what kind of action the plot needs and rolling some dice. That could be gaming - something similar to watching a whodunnit movie as an audience. <br/><br/>Maybe there is a case where you can maintain your idea about your character. If you can somehow ignore the GMs narration and develop something like a 'split shared imagined space' attitude. 'Yes, you as a GM said that my PC sucked but thats just colorful spicing from your part which doesnt really count, because I own my PC and I imagine her to be very-very cool.' Thats a very unhealthy approach but I've seen people doing that out of desperation.<br/><br/>To change that you need to let your players (partially) interpret the results, to determine the 'how.'<br/>Or to be the fan of the characters, and to know them very well, so you can always keep them still cool. <br/>Mercer is good at both of these!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467791/#Comment_467791" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-17T23:59:25+00:00" title="November 17, 2017 11:59PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose it would be sort of fundamental to establish color narration as something that everybody can do, right? As long as the GM maintains an exclusive privilege to impose their imaginary detail, and actively challenges any attempts by the players to open their mouths, it's not going to work.<br/><br/>The two main strategies in this regard would be to be explicit, or be implicit. Being explicit means talking it over with the GM and agreeing with them that yes, it is actually more fun if the players get to describe things, too. A particularly control-freak GM might need all sorts of assurances - for example, something like this:<br/><b>*</b> We're not talking about effective manipulation of significant outcomes, but rather only about minor detail that should rightly be below the attention of a busy GM, anyway. What's it to you, the mighty master of dragons and kings, whether my character swings their sword vertically or horizontally?<br/><b>*</b> Of course you, the GM, will have veto on anything we say, so you just need to sit back and correct it if anybody says something that doesn't fit in the game. You're not actually giving away any control by allowing players to open their mouths. You're the one who knows what's important, anyway, so if a player accidentally steps out of reservation, it's no big deal to fix their narrative contribution in real time, case by case.<br/><br/>The implicit approach would be to simply start talking at the right times and see how the GM reacts. This is what I usually do, and it is the rare GM who reacts to it by calling me on it and forbidding player narration. The most one tends to see is the GM conscientiously "correcting" everything one says, but that's all well and good - worrying over what actually happens in the fiction is for the small minds, you're getting what you want by simply being able to be heard, even if the GM follows you everywhere and picks your litter carefully to make sure nobody starts believing that your rap has any credibility in the fiction.<br/><br/>Either way you go, the reality is that the "color" element of roleplaying game narration is fundamentally a mercilessly competitive verbal art. The goal is to be vivid and impressive, and only that matters in the end, in terms of enjoying play and crafting your character as a memorable protagonist. If the social contract allows you to open your mouth, and your stuff is better than the GM's, they don't really have any recourse against the fact that what is truly satisfying, what sticks to mind about the game experience, is your show.<br/><br/>A healthy human being in the role of the GM will of course recognize soon that it's actually useful for the creative goals of the game that you contribute color commentary on the game, and communicate about how you wish to portray your own character. I'm not nearly as trigger-happy as some people are about throwing people overboard, but I have to say that a GM who <i>doesn't</i> get this after experiencing it in practice may not be worth keeping - they're too much of a control freak, and a participationist game turns into a no game at all if one insists that the players aren't even allowed to speak at the table. It's the bare minimum of rights that I recognize for a functional roleplaying game: you have to be able to shoot the breeze with the other players, joke around, comment upon the events in the game, describe stuff your character does, even if the GM gets absolute veto over what gets to be actionable in the game and what ends up being just talk. Trying to take that away is the last line.<br/><br/>By the way, talking over and around the GM - great fun, assuming proper social decorum is upheld. At times in a participationist game you'll find that playing your character true to their nature will easily sideline them. This will happen to you much easier than it does to the average zombie duck player, too, as the zombie duck's character will obviously always just follow the party wherever the party (and the plot) is going. Meanwhile, you care more for the credibility of the fiction and your character's characterization, so you may easily end up sort of not participating on various scenes as the game goes on. For example, your character might be the one guy in the party who decides to <i>not</i> join the group in shadowing the one character who's got a date tonight, because, well, that's sort of a creepy thing to do if you're not a trad rpg character.<br/><br/>So what you do at those times is, you're a full-time commentator player for the game. Not really that different from when your character is in the scene, really - it's again pretty small-minded to care about your own character to the exclusion of everything else. Obviously you'll ask clarifying questions about the milieu from the GM, and about their characters from the other players - draw out the good stuff for everybody to appreciate. And you provide unasked-for dialogue for both PCs and NPCs, to provide helpful jumping-off points for the other players. Provoke the GM to either play their hand or fold, instead of feeding their content in drips and drabs.<br/><br/>In a word, I'm sort of a nightmare for the hypothetical control freak GM, because the way I've come to understand participationist play is that I really am supposed to engage in a creative dialogue, even if it so happens that the plot of the game is not up for grabs [grin]. Fortunately the control freak GM seems to be pretty much a mythological beast; I've been a trad GM myself for long years on end, I know perfectly well that what you generally want is players who actually engage the game actively and pay attention to your efforts. It just might seem a bit counter-intuitive what that engagement looks like in practice: you'll end up spending a lot of time riffing comedy off the events of the game, providing dialogue for various characters and generally meddling in the proceedings in thoroughly informal ways.<br/><br/>As an amusing anecdote about how this sort of thing works in practice, I'll note that last winter we played a bit of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> here in Upper Savo, with a very traditional GM. I ended up playing through an entire werewolf detective mystery scenario with no character at all. (I had a couple of characters left over from the previous scenario, but the new scenario's adventure hook didn't fit them, so I just decided that they'd stay home and let the investigators with more motivation field this one.) Every time the crew asked me about it, I just told them that I'll pick up a character when the party comes to need some particular talent, or some engaging NPC comes up to naturally join the scenario. As it happened this never occurred, so I played something like four sessions in a row without a character in the game. I learned - not particularly to my surprise - that this did not affect the way I played in any way; the things I did at the table were the same exact things I was doing when I had a character in the campaign. I kibitzed about investigation planning, asked clarifying questions, made hypotheses, provided speaking voices for various characters, made sure the main detective in the group had lively internal debates about moral conundrums, and so on. Fun play in fact, even as the GM totally flubbed the pacing out of some misplaced effort to emulate wargame logic (as in, "this adventure will not go anywhere until you find the right hotspot to click, even if that means we'll sit here for three sessions doing essentially nothing").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467792/#Comment_467792" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T00:12:12+00:00" title="November 18, 2017 12:12AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" rel="nofollow">hamnacb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Maybe there is a case where you can maintain your idea about your character. If you can somehow ignore the GMs narration and develop something like a 'split shared imagined space' attitude. 'Yes, you as a GM said that my PC sucked but thats just colorful spicing from your part which doesnt really count, because I own my PC and I imagine her to be very-very cool.' Thats a very unhealthy approach but I've seen people doing that out of desperation.</p></div></blockquote>\nYes, this is something I touched upon above in my cross-post. I don't think that it's unhealthy, though - rather, I think that this phenomenon of competing visions is rather fundamental to how roleplaying even works. I think players flinging "alternative interpretations" of events around is healthy because of how it contributes inspiration to the game, and because of how it helps keep the GM honest in creative terms: they'll really need to be actually interesting, or why would the other people even care about what they say.<br/><br/>I see this technique of competing, parallel fictions being utilized all the time in all sorts of roleplaying games. For a time around the beginning of the decade I even sort of forgot that it's not a given for some people, but meeting some really fuddy-duddy roleplayers in Helsinki reminded me that some people actually get confused about "what the NPC really said" if three people are throwing out suggestions all at once [grin].<br/><br/>So yeah, I think it's entirely viable at most tables to actively fight for your character vision. In fact, it's not that difficult to hijack the <i>setting</i> vision, or any other vision you'd care to name, if you want to for some reason. In social terms I encourage a positive, friendly attitude, and a willingness to let ideas float out there on their own merits: don't fight over whose vision gets to be official, just say your piece now, and the next time say it again, and continue saying it when necessary. If it is true, it will take over in time.<br/><br/>A minor technical hint for when you're being sneaky and doing this stuff without talking about it explicitly in advance: never negate anything anybody says. Don't say "No, my character instead does this other thing" when you can just say "Yeah, my character does this [not at all what you said]". Just no point elevating the color narration to the level of narrative authority contest when all you want is for your voice to be heard.<br/><br/>For instance, if the GM is in the habit of humiliating your character in a game where you'd much rather play a dashing hero, I think it's quite feasible to just tell everybody how you see your character, every time it comes up. The very worst thing that can happen is that the character gives off an impression as something of a buffoon if the GM's narration is consistently more compelling and your alternative takes start to seem more like desperate lies the character tells to themself [grin]. More likely, the narrative themes and ideas you consistently communicate will start to infect the way others at the table narrate, which ultimately leads to their vision of your character converging on yours, at which point they'll start producing narratives that are more to your liking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467813/#Comment_467813" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T19:40:21+00:00" title="November 18, 2017  7:40PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2017 7:41PM by hamnacb.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/> if the GM is in the habit of humiliating your character in a game where you'd much rather play a dashing hero, I think it's quite feasible to just tell everybody how you see your character, every time it comes up.

Its a very nice analysis and advice too.<br/>&gt; I've just realized that in inplicit (trad) roleplaying you should always try to communicate your vision of the game because this is your only way to set your boundaries and to influence the fiction as a player.<br/>&gt; As status theories say if you fight for something, you already positioned yourself as a struggler. You should always stick to your vision without arguing about it.

I think that's an interesting - and perhaps even lightly provocative - statement. I'm not sure I agree ("not sure" meaning just that - I'd have to think about this further, not a passive-aggressive way to indicate I disagree), but I'd like to consider that possibility and get your opinions on it.<br/><br/>If story gaming is, indeed, catching on as a form of passive entertainment, the form that it takes for the audience is important. Is it possible that GM-led Illusionist or Participationist gaming (in the style of Critical Role, or something like it - a carefully-prepared "GM plot" which the players take part in) is, indeed, more entertaining to watch?<br/><br/>Without reflecting on the artistic value or how much fun it might be as a <i>participant</i> I wonder if there is truth to that statement. Can a fully collaborative, improvised game which relies a fair bit on "out-of-character" conversation be as entertaining for an <i>outside viewer</i> as this kind of game? Less so? More so?<br/><br/>What do you think? What have you seen so far, and what do you think we're likely to see?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467821/#Comment_467821" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T23:19:33+00:00" title="November 18, 2017 11:19PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll clarify that I was not thinking in relative terms when I characterized the "GM's story hour" kind of game as well-known established entertainment. If I had to rank whether it's more interesting to watch that than some other style of rpg, that'd be a much more complex question.<br/><br/>What I intended to say was simply that it is well-known that a well-prepared, skilled storyteller is good entertainment. Putting that into a rpg context does not change the factors, except if the GM ruins their format (which GMs admittedly are prone to do, historically - it's nowhere near a given that a trad GM will perform their role as a storyteller well). Storytellers have competed with e.g. movies not quite until today, but close; at least here in Finland a storyteller was a legit form of children's tv programming up until the late '80s at least; you just get a charismatic storyteller, maybe give them a chalkboard or something to draw on, and let them tell a story. Looking further back into history, storytelling was probably the most popular form of entertainment outside sex in most preindustrial societies, winning over other perennial favourites like music and cat-torture.<br/><br/>That being the case, I am not surprised if it is possible to put up an entertaining rpg show. A participationist game is essentially a storytelling event with some highly stylized storytelling techniques. I'll take it as a given that it's going to work, provided you do it well.<br/><br/>That aside, I wouldn't be keen to make any claims about the relative entertainment value of being an audience to different sorts of games. That's very much similar to trying to gauge which is more entertaining, a sports event or a concert - how do you judge that, except in hindsight over a given population, using popularity as your measure? For individuals it's always going to depend on what they're accustomed to, and what they're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467827/#Comment_467827" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-19T04:15:50+00:00" title="November 19, 2017  4:15AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fears about illusionism are overrated. Illusionism is the default game mode because the majority of players, like the consumers of mass media, are complacent and entirely content to be led by the nose through an adventure. They want to be walked through one combat encounter after another with the occasional social encounter. The heavy lifting falls on the GM\u2019s shoulders. The players want to be passive participants in the GM\u2019s story, occasionally contributing accented quips as they brutalize NPCs, grab the McGuffin, and save the princess.<br/><br/>Illusionism is the lowest common denominator of RPG playing. It requires little of the players, and they are satisfied with this. Illusionism is perfectly acceptable for most RPG players for this reason. I do not disparage them for this, mind you. I\u2019m sure my time smacks of RPG elitism, but I am hardly that sort (my preference is player-directed traditional gaming). People ought to play what they enjoy, and illusionist games can be immensely enjoyable with the right people.<br/><br/>By that same token, D&amp;D is the McDonald\u2019s of RPGs. It is ubiquitous, accessible, and acceptably palatable. It can fulfill a variety of tastes as long as though tastes have a distinctly fast food flavor. You can do heroic fantasy, you can do dark fantasy, you can do science fantasy, you can do horror fantasy...as long as that fantasy flavor has that D&amp;D feel (not too heroic, not too gritty, not too far removed from grid-based combat with an emphasis on resource management).<br/><br/>I should reiterate the above sentiments: dissatisfaction with D&amp;D breeds different games. Without D&amp;D, there would be no PbtA or Burning Wheel or Hillfolk. The more RPGs spread in popularity, the more people will play other games, including storygames. More people will synthesize and house rule and publish story-focused games. Illusionism or not, we are in the midst of a gaming renaissance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467828/#Comment_467828" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-19T04:18:28+00:00" title="November 19, 2017  4:18AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2017 4:19AM by Vivificient.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting points about storytelling and the entertainment value of games.<br/><br/>The flip side is that it would be very hard to achieve the same production values with a more open-ended game.  You couldn't have all the perfect props and sound cues lined up and ready if you didn't know what was going to happen.<br/><br/>I'm thinking especially how much harder it would be to make a hit video show playing one-off story games like Microscope.  You wouldn't achieve the same branding with recurring characters and settings.  The actors and their personalities could still be a draw, if they were fun to watch and good at improv.

Meanwhile, here is a quote from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8EoyXTHV8" rel="nofollow">a video</a> by a fellow named Matt Colville (who has a popular stream of "How to D&amp;D" videos) about the finale of the series. He appears to be a bit of a YouTube D&amp;D celebrity himself. <br/><br/>As you can see, he has a really high opinion and appreciation of this particular D&amp;D campaign as <i>art</i>. He is talking about a combat outcome from the final "boss fight" which led to the (potential) death for one of the other characters. At times he seems to have tears in his eyes as he speaks. I quote from the video:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Matt_Colville" rel="nofollow">Matt_Colville</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"[...] everything that happened in that game,  I think, led to that moment... and, if Sam had been able to pull it off, then I think the story of that game would be written very differently. <br/><br/>"And, because I didn't notice it when it happened - because I think most people didn't notice it when it happened - I just wanted to make a video calling attention to it, and saying, you know, "Congratulations" to those guys for creating this... work of art - how else do you describe it? This Great Work, with a capital "G" and a capital "W", that, you know, was ephemeral [...] there are rules and there are plans, but, as you saw, those plans do not survive contact with the enemy.<br/><br/>"We're all just incredibly lucky, I think, to get to share this experience and talk about it together. [...] You know, I'm sure there are other moments like this in other <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> games (like I said, not in mine! ...at least not yet), but a unique moment in the history of this game [...]<br/><br/>"You know, all artistic revolutions are predicated on an earlier technological revolution. You don't get [...] Jimi Hendrix until you have the electric guitar [other examples follow] you don't get Rembrandt and Caravaggio until someone figures out how to paint with oil [...] and you don't get <i>Critical Role</i> until you have streaming services like Twitch.<br/><br/>"That's the technology on which this artistic moment is built. Because it was the climax of the game - because 35,000 people are watching it - Matt [the DM of <i>Critical Role</i>] got a lot of flak online, which I think is just the price anyone who streams a game is gonna have to pay." [He proceeds to talk about "mistakes" made by the DM and group, and who they aren't, really, mistakes at all.]<br/><br/>"[...] given what I just showed you - I mean, is that not the most astonishing, satisfying, dramatic, emotional moment that you've seen in a game? It is for me. It certainly is for me: it's head and shoulders above anything else that I've seen." <br/> </p></div></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467845/#Comment_467845" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-19T21:19:43+00:00" title="November 19, 2017  9:19PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In that regard I guess we're witnessing a situation where the conscientious showman-GM finally gets their due in terms of accolades, thanks to the outside audience.

Maybe that works better in the intense club gaming environments of the '70s (where Gygax comes from), or in bigger cities, but I haven't really ever seen a GM being long-term psychologically "fed" and rewarded for hard work in a one-sided entertainment relationship by being worshiped as a "master GM" the way Gygax explains it.

I don\u2019t think it would be necessary to cut out all player-negotiation\u2014you would keep the essential and entertaining negotiation\u2014and I definitely agree player-negotiation is an important part of collaborative, GMless Story Games. What I was most referring to was extraneous or less essential talk generally. I definitely think more editing would be necessary to make a collaborative, GMless Story Game channel competitive with something like Critical Role. Eric Vulgaris has a Story Game channel called Once Upon a Game that doesn\u2019t have any editing and it gives you an idea of what it would look like without editing.

The group had been playing for two years already, meaning that all kinds of details and all kinds of procedures had already become second nature to them.<br/><br/>2. The pre-plotted, traditional nature of the game meant that much of the material could be prepared ahead of time.<br/><br/>I read that the DM, at least, would prepare and work on the NPC voices ahead of the game. And you can see that many of the colourful descriptions he delivers are scripted - again, he wrote them before the game. He has handouts for maps and other details, again, prepared before the game.<br/><br/>While the game is still raw and unedited, in a way that's a form of editing before it hits the stream. (For instance, he would have edited his descriptions until they were right on the money, and then he can deliver them without hesitation in play.)<br/><br/>Hard(er) to do that in collaborative gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467855/#Comment_467855" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-20T04:13:28+00:00" title="November 20, 2017  4:13AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking of my own play experiences, I wouldn't expect egalitarian gaming with high improvisation quotient to be at any fundamental disadvantage in entertainment compared to a carefully prepped GM strutting their stuff. On the one hand you've got, well, careful prep, but on the other you have not one, but e.g. five people contributing their ingenuity in a way that's impossible for a trad game.<br/><br/>Of course the content's going to be different, and the strengths and weaknesses also in different places: a GMed game won't suffer as much for having a dummy at the table, and a railroaded structure enables more detailed prepping. Meanwhile, an egalitarian game will bring the fundamental creative processes to the fore right there and then, for an unparalleled intimate look into how stories actually get made.<br/><br/>Ultimately, other things being equal, I would expect it to come down to the nature of the cast: if you have five talented people to work with (and I mean talented roleplayers, not actors), then I'll pretty much wager money on them producing more and better content per time unit when playing an egalitarian game than when being bottlenecked by a powerful GM. If you have weak links in the group, a powerful GM can cover for them, provided the GM's up to it.<br/><br/>Also, the nature of the entertainment: are you there for story, or are you there to see a bunch of people perform a difficult craft with high artistry? If the former, then a GMed railroad is a pretty obvious choice, frankly; if the latter, then I expect you'll want the core creativity to actually occur at the table, where you can see the magic. Probably you want a bit of both, of course.<br/><br/>My experience doesn't support the idea that there would be more content-empty table talk in a proge game as compared to a trad one. That part's strictly a function of social style and quality of play, I think. I've seen it go both ways, sometimes to ridiculous degrees. This holds true even if we (for some unfathomable reason) consider rules-talk to be ancillary, that's just a matter of choosing a system with suitable points of contact. Play something like say S/lay w/ Me (example chosen due to fresh experience with it), and you'll have much, much less rules-talk than even the most minimal D&amp;D table can achieve.<br/><br/>In summation: pick a GMless story game with good rules, and put together a group that actually knows the game well enough to not stop to reference the rules every five minutes, and you should get about as interesting a show as you'd get with a GM. Different, of course, but no less engaging for an audience interested in that sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467866/#Comment_467866" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-20T20:14:25+00:00" title="November 20, 2017  8:14PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2017 8:18PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said about passive players mirrors my own experience, sort of.  <br/><br/>I've never seen anyone put in all the time and effort to make a D&amp;D character and <i>not</i> come to the table with the desire to get to be that character in <i>some</i> fashion.  Usually the minimum is getting to be cool in the ways in which that character is cool.  If the GM affords them no opportunity to do that, then no, I don't think many players are <i>completely</i> content to be <i>completely</i> passive.  (At least not initially.  Maybe some of them get used to it over time.)<br/><br/>That said, given a few chances to be cool, I do think such players do tend to enjoy being along for the ride most of the time, assuming the ride is a decent one.<br/><br/>I don't know whether such players are a majority, but they certainly might be.<br/><br/>I'd say most skilled storytellers are way more entertaining than most GMs, but being inside the story and having the opportunity to experience it as if you're there makes a huge difference IMO.  I'd rather spend 4 hours walking around in a Grade B plot than 4 hours simply listening to a Grade A plot.<br/><br/>I've done some design work on a game that would make this sort of player-GM dynamic explicit, but I wonder whether over-stating the player's role is more alluring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467888/#Comment_467888" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-21T17:52:11+00:00" title="November 21, 2017  5:52PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2017 5:54PM by hamnacb.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What *would* be an illustrative example, then?

Can we defeat him? I should not care about that because the GM already decided that in advance. Maybe he will die, maybe he will flee or (seem to) die in the collapse of the cave, I dont know.<br/><br/>I should also not interrupt his monologue to shoot at him because the point is not to cause him as much damage as possible but to meaningfully engage with the story of the GM.<br/><br/>I should also not care about whether I roll high on my attack roll or not, because the GM can lower or raise the antagonist's HP whenever he wants.<br/><br/>Let's say I want to show the coolness of my character, so I decide to fight with the (weak) goons. Unfortunately I roll low but I dont panic and dont try to find the most effective feat combo. I just show how I struggle against their superior number. I narrate that and then shout 'You cannot stop our movement! Your reign will end here!', because I'm a freedom fighter. Later I roll good so I narrate the way I subdue most of them and make wooshy-wooshy sounds with my swords. Then one of them stabs me in the back with a crit. No worry! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I narrate the way I collapse and my final rattlings before I faint. 'You can put out the torch but cannot stop the wildfire!' The GM will not let me die if my character is important in the story <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>My satisfaction with the fight comes from being able to connect with the story, maintaining the vision of my character, communicating the notion of freedom fighting which is important to my as a player, and not from winning the fight. My player skills and my luck have only partial effect on the latest, but the first three depends on me.<br/><br/>Is that a good example for you?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467892/#Comment_467892" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-21T18:17:26+00:00" title="November 21, 2017  6:17PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that makes total sense to me. Great example, thank you. That's how I would engage with this sort of play, as well - basically, you're looking to work as an improv actor who's participating in a script that's not fully known to you, and trying to "sell" the fiction which is going on without disrupting it.<br/><br/>Of course, it could be challenging to adopt stances like "The GM will not let me die if...", when most GMs will not admit to their game having that sort of structure. (Challenging because <i>what if you read the situation wrong</i>?)<br/><br/>But then, that's just another argument for above-the-table, upfront communication about the nature of the game. Illusionist practices - and the culture of hiding or misrepresenting what roleplaying is and what the GM is doing, what I like to call the "GM Mystery Cult" - make this kind of thing so complicated sometimes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Critical Role and the Rise of D&amp;D - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21370/critical-role-and-the-rise-of-d-d/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Critical Role and the Rise of D&amp;amp;D - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21370/critical-role-and-the-rise-of-d-d/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Meanwhile, I keep exploring this new online D&amp;D celebrity culture.

       Meanwhile, I keep exploring this new online D&amp;D celebrity culture. It's totally fascinating, although much of it very foreign to me.<br/><br/>Here's a perfect example. It's a video of a woman named Satine Phoenix (her stage name, since she started her career as an adult film star, but has now transitioned to doing celebrity appearance and fundraising D&amp;D stuff, as well as art) giving tips about running a D&amp;D game.<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-NjmkolUrrB4?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjmkolUrrB4"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/NjmkolUrrB4/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>It's pretty cool to see someone make such a transition into this field and to be making money doing it. I'm all for that. She runs another very well-received and popular D&amp;D game which streams online called "<a href="http://www.mazearcana.com/" rel="nofollow">Maze Arcana</a>". <br/><br/>However, the actual content leaves me fairly dissatisfied. I'm not saying it's all bad advice; just that it sounds like it's by people who see roleplaying as an entirely different activity than I do. The GM's job here is to provide a service, to entertain, and to try to give the players the best they can (much like the Matt Mercer video I linked to earlier, on preparing one-shots), because clearly the players can't fend for themselves.<br/><br/>It's worth checking out if you're curious about what I mean; fascinating stuff. Notably, she begins the video by explaining that she, unfortunately, is NOT Matt Mercer (the fellow who ran Critical Role), but nevertheless has GMing experience and expertise...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467896/#Comment_467896" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-21T18:37:28+00:00" title="November 21, 2017  6:37PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're not sure what this whole thread is about or why it might appear strange and unfamiliar, I'd recommend seeing that last link I posted.

Every time the spotlight is on him and he needs to decide what to do, he freezes a bit. Sometimes you can clearly see the fear of saying (doing) something uncool in his eyes. Usually he solves it with falling back to what he is confident about: speaking in deep voice.<br/><br/>An actor who does have actual RPG experience is confused in front of a camera.

I'd be suprised if there was a way to find out for sure, though, unless he admits as much in an interview somewhere.<br/><br/>Still, there are all kinds of structures in place in modern D&amp;D and the culture surrounding it which all support an Illusionist or Participationist approach to play. You can see that in his "How to craft one-shots" video, above - he says he's open to players doing different things, but clearly he expects his planned plot to come through nevertheless.<br/><br/>Some examples:<br/><br/>1. Given the GM's level of prep (painting miniatures, making maps, preparing NPCs and handouts), the players (GM included) will gravitate towards revealing that prep, which means collaborating towards moving in those directions. "Where's the adventure? Let's go there," in other words.<br/><br/>The characters don't have goals of their own; following "the plot" is the point of play, kind of like in a video game. (And it's possible that video game experience informs the players' approach here, too.)<br/><br/>2. Many things in the adventures require a roll - noticing something, figuring something out, escaping a dangerous situation, etc. In all these cases, however, all the players get a roll. There are seven or eight players in this game. Because of "bounded accuracy", the odds of success are always reasonable. As you can figure out for yourself, that means that the rolls pretty much never fail. (Even assuming no character has the necessary skill and therefore odds of success are low - which is unlikely! with 7 characters someone will have the skills or abilities necessary - seven people rolling means your odds of failure are in the 0.1%-0.2% range. That's fifteen times less likely than rolling a natural 20!)<br/><br/>3. This applies to combat, too. D&amp;D combats tend to be either against large groups of weak monsters (where character abilities for mass damage and battlefield control allow them to rein havoc) or a single "boss" monster.<br/><br/>Against a "boss" monster, things feel very scary. After all, the thing has way more hit points than any typical character, and can take someone down in a single hit!<br/><br/>However, it only gets so many actions per round, which means that characters can be "killed", but never the whole party - usually, someone can run over and heal the downed character and then get back into the fight. Healing magic is ridiculously plentiful, from healing via short rests to potions, items, and healing spells, and it doesn't take long to reach high enough levels to having "bring back from the dead"-type magic.<br/><br/>All this means that fights can *feel* scary ("That thing has HOW MANY hit points?!?") but very, very rarely if ever end in defeat for the PCs. So, the GM can pretty confidently plan those "setpiece" battles while still being confident that the PCs will advance through the plot.<br/><br/>In the case of Critical Role, it sounds like at least one character died "for real". That character, however, was allowed to make a bargain with Death (or the Gods, or whoever) to return to life as a revenant and to complete their quest. (Whereupon they would die for good.)<br/><br/>This is a perfect example of a subtler Illusionist or Participationist technique: we make it sound like the character "dies" twice (first, by falling in combat, and second when the "quest" is complete). Two defeats! However, of course, since "completing the quest" means the game ends, the character's actual death isn't really meaningful to the game. (The player gets to keep playing the character for the entire duration of the campaign, unchanged, after all.)<br/><br/>If you want to run a game/story in this fashion, it's not too hard to arrange. It would be pretty difficult to accidentally create a threat which could wipe out all the characters at once, with no chance for rescue or resurrection. (Or so it seems to me; my D&amp;D5 experience at this point is fairly limited.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467904/#Comment_467904" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-21T21:57:41+00:00" title="November 21, 2017  9:57PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hamnacb,<br/><br/>I just watched the D&amp;Diesel episode you posted. I don't know if it's actually scripted, but those perfectly-timed criticals are strange, aren't they? On the other hand, the players seem to react to them quite authentically. (Then again, they're all actors!)<br/><br/>(I also noticed how Vin Diesel was described as the one noticing the wraiths, even though he didn't have the highest roll! Could have been a mistake, though.)<br/><br/>Although it's (lightly) edited, it's a perfect example of all the things I've been talking about so far:<br/><br/>* The GM brings the "fun", narrates dramatic and spectacular events and descriptions. He's extremely good at it, and does some of his trademark voices and sound effects (although here it's less obvious how much of it is him, since sound effects are added to the video).<br/><br/>* The players are along for the ride. They have no real goals or interests aside from following the plot. <br/><br/>They roll dice and then sit in rapt attention to hear the GM's next brilliant bit of narration.<br/><br/>* The rolls that are made - including the combats - have no real stakes, since the number of rolls means success is basically guaranteed.<br/><br/>* The players contribute character voices and make basic decisions in combat. They have no real artistic or creative input into the game here. There is only one moment (two, if you count Diesel's killing blow against the final monster) where a player even narrates anything - the rogue's "backflip" and attack are met with stunned reactions and laughter, it being such a brave step forward.<br/><br/>However, even in those cases, the GM makes sure to re-narrate and further dramatize their descriptions.<br/><br/>* The people involved are cool, attractive, celebrities, or actors.<br/><br/>All of this stuff is amplified, given the context of a (potentially scripted) short YouTube video meant to showcase a guest actor. However, in what I saw of Critical Role, it was all present in the "real" game, as well, just less obviously so. There was more breathing room there, and more space for chit-chat and for the players to actually do things, but, fundamentally, the process of play seemed quite similar to me to what we're seeing here.<br/><br/>For instance, it's clear in these instances that there is no "plot" other than what the GM brings to the table, and the players' role is to follow and uncover it, while rolling dice and cheering each other on.<br/><br/>My conclusions from watching this would be to say that the player/GM divide is absolutely stark - they are fundamentally different activities requiring different levels of commitment and skill, to an extent which is almost unthinkable. No wonder, in this mainstream RPG culture, that "being a GM" is seen as a badge of extreme honour, and something you have to earn; something frightening which requires immense talent and charisma.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467907/#Comment_467907" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-21T22:37:59+00:00" title="November 21, 2017 10:37PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Of course, it could be challenging to adopt stances like "The GM will not let me die if...", when most GMs will not admit to their game having that sort of structure.

It's not even a mystery why it is so, it's all because of the wargaming heritage of roleplaying: GMs feel that they're getting away with something when they fudge combats, and they're averse to doing that to the degree that would be optimal for really punching home the illusionist storytelling program.<br/><br/>In my experience it has been massively more common for illusionist GMs to fail because they fudge too little (and consequently don't frame sharp enough: too much time spent on empty dicing ritual instead of cutting to the chase), rather than because of fudging too much. People are entirely too dependent on the gaming mythology of D&amp;D in the mainstream, I think; their play would benefit immensely if the GMs themselves were less conflicted and delusional about the railroading. It would be justified to pinpoint this whole point as the theoretical insight that caused the Nordic freeform style to diverge from traditional roleplaying and start developing towards what it is today.<br/><br/>(This of course only applies to games that are, in fact, railroad-y illusionist games. A trad game can do other things, too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467909/#Comment_467909" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-22T00:25:48+00:00" title="November 22, 2017 12:25AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with that, of course, Eero (as should be clear from my posts above, I would think). <br/><br/>I had no idea that Nordic RP evolved from this branch of the tree, however!

I'm not internally and intimately familiar with the history of the school, not being a practitioner, but I've lived in the scene over the years when it got its start in the late '90s, and that's how I always understood it.<br/><br/>To be specific, the first we knew of freeform here in Finland, as it was early on known, was that a bunch of gamers with a disposition towards larping, GM fiat illusionism, character immersion and very lightweight rules use were establishing a distinctive style of play around these premises around the millennium. The people doing it in e.g. Helsinki, on tabletop, were stereotypically Whitewolf gamers who abandoned any pretense of using the rules in favour of fiat and a focus on immersive play. This developed, with the creative weight mostly centered in the larp scene, into a trend towards abandoning existing rpg texts and their American-geek topics in favour of topical mainstreaming (so less obscure and genrified subject matters for games, and more GM originality, with less dependence on commercial rpg products). The Nordic larp scene was being born at the time (the tabletop gamers have never cooperated across the borders to the same extent), and the big defining ideas (fiat, immersion, artistic ambition, refusal of traditional geek culture) spread quickly and latched into place as what we now know as "Nordic freeform" in the early '00s.<br/><br/>The sense I got from playing a little bit with people who were into it in Helsinki early on is specifically as I intimated above: the creative motor of the revolution in gaming was the need to push the illusionist fiat GM paradigm as far as it could go: be a better, stronger, faster GM, with more reliability to your games, with stronger emotional impact, with more serious artistry to the themes and content. Explicitly dropping the rules altogether (as opposed to keeping them in there for the emotional security of the players) was the idea that gave the movement its name (that's what "freeform" means, in case somebody here didn't know that) and laid down the central artistic strategy that came to define the playstyle. Not everybody sharing these ambitions chose to double-down on the freeform precepts, but those who did came to largely dominate the Nordic larping world, in which scene freeform (or internal schools with minor differences that vehemently deny being freeform) is nowadays practically the only game in town.<br/><br/>(Later on freeform has, of course, developed further, so characterizing its fruit today as simply illusionistic GM fiat without rules would be somewhat simplistic. This was clearly the starting point, though; when Jeep came in a couple of years later, bringing more refinement to the tabletop side of the equation, it was observed distinctly as a development in and within the tradition rather than something new altogether.)<br/><br/>If you're interested in the historical theoretical underpinnings of the style/school/scene/tradition, check out the <a href="http://www.mikepohjola.com/turku/" rel="nofollow">Turku school</a> stuff from the early '00s. It's one of the early and influential formulations of the tradition. This was what all right-minded roleplayers around here were criticizing when the Forge was still new [grin].<br/><br/>I'm sure that if we didn't discuss this at the tail-end of a thread on an entirely different topic, we would get somebody with a more intimate relationship to the freeform scene to correct me on this stuff. Despite being in the geographical region where the style developed, it's really not at all my style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings" title="rhysmakesthings"><img alt="rhysmakesthings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings">rhysmakesthings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467912/#Comment_467912" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-22T04:02:12+00:00" title="November 22, 2017  4:02AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the second most popular version of this is RollPlay. It's got some interesting differences. Firstly, it was started by a popular video game streamer, not a group of voice actors. The players they get to play in their games are other popular video game streamers. Secondly, they have a variety of not only games but also GM's. The GM's include John Harper for their Blades in the Dark campaign, and their regular DM is Adam Koebel of Dungeon World. They run things pretty differently from Critical Role in general, probably their most similar is their Court of Swords campaign but even it is quite different with a high amount of player death. They've got an interesting recent video about the combats in Court of Swords and the lethality thereof, which includes some discussion of the considerations required for playing D&amp;D in front of a livestreamed audience as opposed to in a normal game, particularly with regards to pacing. But, though they have this more GM prep heavy game, they also have a very low prep FATE game called Nebula Jazz, and a whole host of styles of games in their backlog as well including my favourite, OSR Hexcrawl West Marches GM'd by Stephen Lumpkin.<br/><br/>The DM's they get typically have a more modern understanding and appreciation of roleplaying and the related theory, though they do use that understanding for illusionist play sometimes, especially due to the constraints imposed by their format. I'd recommend checking it out for a more balanced view of popular watch people play rpg content.<br/><br/>Personally I don't enjoy Critical Role much, and RollPlay can be good but I usually enjoy just listening to it and maybe swapping over to the tab every once in a while if something interesting is going on, not something I'd just sit and watch definitely.<br/><br/>I would say that the mainstream of watching RPG's will probably stay with heavily GM plotted things, because that allows for the much higher production values that wider audiences can appreciate even if they don't have any interest in the game itself. But, RollPlay is proof that even non-trad gaming without GM plotting or awesome looking miniatures or maps can be incredibly popular as well. And the audience is only growing. I wouldn't be concerned that so many people are exposed to the GM plot style, it's how I started and my friends and I had fun with it. People who become more interested will delve a little deeper and discover the different ways of playing, which may or may not be to their tastes. \n<blockquote><br/>will the hobby once again be dominated by Illusionist D&amp;D play?<br/></blockquote>\nAs for this, I would say that this kind of play has never gone away, and has always been one of the most popular. You've most likely just avoided it yourself after figuring out it isn't for you.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a big movement, and most likely is changing the hobby, but only by getting more people interested and wanting to play. The more the merrier I say!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467913/#Comment_467913" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-22T04:18:00+00:00" title="November 22, 2017  4:18AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, this thread is giving me an idea. Not something I'd be able to execute any time soon, but it'd be amazing. Get four or so actors, and run Godbound for them, as one of these YouTube channels. Position the camera so that the focus is off of the GM and on the players. Make sure they develop distinct personae, vocal mannerisms, etc., for their characters, which most actors who RP are wont to do anyway.<br/><br/>Who wouldn't want to tune into the adventures of a group of demigods, played by actors, on a regular basis? You might want to edit some of the mechanical upkeep stuff into a summary. "And lo did On-thak, God of the Sky, Sea, and Sword, grant wings to all his followers." But there's not one bit of illusionism in Godbound; it's not even possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467917/#Comment_467917" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-22T12:18:47+00:00" title="November 22, 2017 12:18PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All you need is a webcam, VERY GOOD MICROPHONES and quick but efficient color and light toning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467919/#Comment_467919" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-22T15:29:16+00:00" title="November 22, 2017  3:29PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true! <br/><br/>Eero, thank you for that historical summary of Nordic freeform; I wasn't aware of many of those details!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467928/#Comment_467928" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T00:58:16+00:00" title="November 23, 2017 12:58AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Deliverator,<br/><br/>While I find the Godbound concept quite interesting, do we have any reason to think other people value that?

You can make decisions preemptively so that you don\u2019t have to fudge a roll if it\u2019s not time for the possibility of a narrative outcome that may not be fitting, such as a character\u2019s death. Some people may say what\u2019s the difference. For me, there\u2019s a certain tension that comes when I as player know that the role is always for real. The DM and I may be orchestrating the context, but something is on the line, something is risked, something could go wrong and change everything.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467947/#Comment_467947" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T14:53:09+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  2:53PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't even participationist/illusionist D&amp;D still offer more player freedom of action than pretty much any other sort of commonly encountered game?<br/><br/>( I don't play CRPGs, so I may not have seen ones with more freedom than TTRPGs).<br/><br/>That may explain a lot of this phenomenon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467950/#Comment_467950" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T15:23:40+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  3:23PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, in even the most GM-controlled RPG, you can technically do whatever you want with your character.

I think it takes (for most people) quite a bit of roleplaying experience to start to notice patterns in play which hint at this kind of thing. <br/><br/>For an extended example, I GMed from the start (I introduced my friends to D&amp;D in grade 4!). I was a pretty bad railroader (although I was clever about it, and I don't think they knew or cared). After years of that, I got sick of it. I decided to change my approach when I was in University. I wanted to be surprised, too, you know? <br/><br/>There, I ran some games for a few years where I very explicitly and very specifically did NOT use any Illusionist practices, and tried to "play to find out" in every way possible. It was a good experiment, but surprisingly demanding in terms of effort. Finally, after a few years, I noticed that, even though I wasn't railroading in any way I could sense, most of the events of the campaign(s) were, in retrospect, totally predictable to me. <br/><br/>I had discovered that System Matters; that all the best intentions in the world don't matter if the System at the table means that every important fictional turning point resolves according to my judgement - effectively, I was making 90%+ of the fictional input into the developing story, even though I was *trying* in every possible way to hand that off to the players. <br/><br/>It was only by playing games which explicitly handed that authority to the players that I found gaming where the outcome of each session was truly in question, and I could be just as surprised as them by the outcomes.<br/><br/>On another note, I listened to a bit of a discussion about Critical Role where the GM talks about this, as well as the polished nature of the show.<br/><br/>He said that the players were all newbies when they started, and things were really clunky - it was quite a paradigm shift for a bunch of voice actors to suddenly go "off-script", for instance, and he says it took them ages to understand that, yes, they could really "try anything". Play was much rougher back then.<br/><br/>He said he was glad the show started two years into the campaign, when they had established a familiar operating protocol, and adjusted to playing with each other in a way which could be efficient and smooth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467969/#Comment_467969" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T21:23:20+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  9:23PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those curious about getting deeper into this, there is a (very lengthy) discussion on YouTube between Adam Koebel, Matt Mercer, Matt Colville, and Mike Mearls which touches quite a bit on the subject of streaming D&amp;D, its popularity, and how that is changing the game.<br/><br/>Notably, Mike Mearls speaks about how the paradigm shift for Wizards of the Coast going into 5th Edition has been recognizing that D&amp;D is less a <i>product</i> and more a <i>culture</i>, and how that has changed their approach to marketing and design. He compares it to Harley-Davidson culture: presumably not a company who is trying to sell the latest, newest motorcycle to all its customers every year, but, rather, one that fosters the sense of identity people achieve by being associated with their product. Much like someone riding a Harley-Davidson feels part of a subculture, so it is with D&amp;D. Mearls uses the example of people he has seen who wear <i>Critical Role</i> t-shirts, despite never having actually played D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I'm starting to see this, too. In my social circles (non-gamer circles) I'm seeing a different attitude. In "my day", being a gamer was a somewhat secret thing, sometimes even shameful - you hope to weed out who might be friendly to your weird hobby before revealing that you're part of it. Newer gamers seem to be proud of the label, and advertise it with paraphernalia of various sorts.<br/><br/>Anyway, here is the discussion:<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-yqjLO6YNKV0?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjLO6YNKV0"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/yqjLO6YNKV0/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>Most of the larger discussion about culture, design, and popular impact of streaming takes place in the last 30-40 minutes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467973/#Comment_467973" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T21:45:59+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  9:45PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            " D&amp;D is to Harley-Davidson, as Mazes&amp;Monsters is to Easy Rider" ?

Which sounds like it would be a good thing... but my impression is that relatively few of the CR types actually end up as active players.<br/><br/>The problem with this is that the local \u2018master GMs\u2019 (*shudder*) are all running games already - they don\u2019t have the time and energy to take on additional groups, especially when the player expectation is that they\u2019ll put on Matt Mercer levels of preparation. Meanwhile, the CR-fan players mostly aren\u2019t interested in non-D&amp;D games which <i>are</i> open to new players (such as the biweekly indie/story game night) and aren\u2019t confident enough to GM for themselves (because, you know, you have to be a <i>master</i> GM).

It's a little bit unfortunate to hear that this is realized, at least in one game club. The dynamics portrayed on the show do very little to demystify GMing or create a sense of DIY ethos - I would expect to push people away from playing (as you describe) rather than inspiring them to run their own games.<br/><br/>The "advice" published by the YouTube does not seem to help matters. The "GM Mystery Cult" is alive and well, and even the "helpful" videos seem to obfuscate more than they clarify.<br/><br/>Here's a perfect example:<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-zHFFFP6F0VY?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHFFFP6F0VY"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/zHFFFP6F0VY/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>The video says "GMing is fun and you should try it", and then tries to explain that, in order to be a GM, you should read a small library of tomes on dramatic theory. Then, once you're running the game, it's your job to bring those dramatic theories into action (and, it is arguably implied, if you fail to do so, you have failed at being a GM). <br/><br/>The guest seems genuinely enthusiastic about running games, but her explanations of "layered Harmon story circles", operating at the campaign level, character level, and subplot level simultaneously, in perfect coordination (which she admits is very difficult) can only be incredibly intimidating to someone hoping to learn some useful techniques, I would imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467992/#Comment_467992" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-25T18:44:42+00:00" title="November 25, 2017  6:44PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2017 7:02PM by AsIf.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been trad GMing for 40 years, ran an AD&amp;D campaign world with scores of PCs that went for a decade, I am a structuralist, and a huge proponent of Harmon's Story Circle in play.

It seems like so many people have just dropped it into conversation or accidentally revealed it to me, and now several have invited me to play.<br/><br/>Unfortunately (for my tastes), it's always *D&amp;D* and never *roleplaying games*. It seems that many/most of these people are drawn to the brand - at whatever level - and often entirely unaware that other games even exist.<br/><br/>I find this particularly interesting, since in the last 5-6 years it has seemed to me that "indie" games have been exploding in popularity, largely thanks to games like <i>Fiasco</i>, <i>Apocalypse World</i>, and <i>Dungeon World</i>. If anything, the new popularity of D&amp;D appears to be eclipsing that altogether. (No doubt there will be other "waves" as these things rebound and stabilize, but it's still surprising at a number of levels.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468419/#Comment_468419" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-12T09:26:26+00:00" title="December 12, 2017  9:26AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very lucky in that several of the players in my Wednesday 5E group at a gaming store are very interested in other games and play them sometimes.

It is not D&amp;D. Family therapy is when you and your relatives meet with a councilor and yell at each other for thirty minutes. Once session ends, everyone gets in the car to yell at each other for another half hour. Then you get home, you yell some more, someone throws a plate through the kitchen window, and the cops get called.<br/><br/>Putting your family around a D&amp;D table will not solve everyone's problems. Assuming you can get everyone to read the rules (you won't), Just because you're in the same party doesn't mean you're on the same team. If my family tried to play D&amp;D, we'd end the first session by killing each other. In real life.<br/><br/>I can't speak for everyone's family, but if you're capable of getting your kids to willingly play D&amp;D together, you don't need therapy. Forcing them to the table will only make things worse.<br/><br/>Long story short, I want to kill this lady's family. Actually, no. I'll kill her, and leave her family alive. That way, they can have some goddamned problems like the rest of us.<br/><br/>You know, I had this really nice post about how I had been introduced to D&amp;D through podcasts and videos, and how it had given me a skewed perspective on what roleplaying actually was, but then this person had to start blabbing their mouth when they have no idea what they're talking about. I don't care how big a D&amp;D nerd you are or how happy your family is, you do not get to claim it'll solve everyone's problems!<br/><br/>I need to lie down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468887/#Comment_468887" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-13T08:15:42+00:00" title="January 13, 2018  8:15AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">@FriendlyAlienLocust</a>: <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468889/#Comment_468889" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-13T10:04:55+00:00" title="January 13, 2018 10:04AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2018 10:05AM by Rafu.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For people like me who are too lazy and text-oriented to watch videos, who's the celebrity here?<br/><br/>Also, <a href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust">@FriendlyAlienLocust</a> : this kind of excessive and possibly irresponsible claims sound like a feature or popular entertainment to me.

It was less the content and more the presentation; the slow-mo shots of people rolling dice while everyone smiles didn't help. Everyone should be miserable and depressed, because I said so.<br/><br/>For the record, I don't hold any grudges. Mayim Bialik seems like a very nice person that only wants to help others. Seeing that she has a doctorate in neuroscience, she probably knows more than me. And I'm a biased individual with a different understanding of family therapy than most.<br/><br/>Still, there's something the irks me about D&amp;D entering celebrity culture. Celebrities can be experts, but they don't always have a neuroscience degree. Having them steer the discussion might cause problems if it D&amp;D consumes the market. There's always gonna be a story games niche, but why sell to a niche when you can sell to the masses?<br/><br/>Going forward, my best guess is story games will mirror the indie video games scene; major publishers neglect the niche, allowing others to swoop in. But considering how indie devs are doing nowadays...I hope I'm wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468901/#Comment_468901" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-13T20:14:30+00:00" title="January 13, 2018  8:14PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All us indie designers are secretly just contributing innovations for D&amp;D to half-adopt in 10 years.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/drdrek" title="drdrek"><img alt="drdrek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/drdrek">drdrek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468904/#Comment_468904" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-14T03:16:48+00:00" title="January 14, 2018  3:16AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think its positive. <br/>If these shows create 100,000 new exclusively D&amp;D players and only 100 players that will explore the subject of roleplaying more deeply you still have a net gain.

My first exposure was from The Spoony Experiment's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFI3kfmevIHBNZlXYi0Y-zm7b2lrDWlfN" rel="nofollow">Counter Monkey series</a>. Spoony is rather old-school, but he never talked about game mechanics or the like. He just talked about stories, without mentioning the mechanics. Even when he's talking shop, he never mentions mechanics by name. For instance, did you know the best way to unlock a door is to knock? It's not in the rules...but it works.<br/><br/>From there, my D&amp;D podcast of choice was <a href="https://austinyorski.podbean.com/" rel="nofollow">Dice Funk</a>. During the first season, the vast majority of episodes didn't have combat. Not exactly representative of the D&amp;D experience, though the players' reluctance to use violence made me sympathetic to the characters. It's hard to care about someone if they kill everything they come across, even if that's fun for the player.<br/><br/>Noticing a pattern? The hosts, not the game, make the shows fun. The game could be crap, but a good group can work it into something watchable. Likewise, a good game can be ruined if the characters aren't worth watching. It's the difference between playing a game and watching a Let's Play: it looks like the game, it sounds like the game, but it doesn't necessarily represent the game. And I probably should have realized this before I started roleplaying.<br/><br/>Another pattern; internet celebrities. I've never been too involved in pop culture, so many of the bigger D&amp;D shows slipped by. The stuff I watched came from online content creators. Spoony did work with Channel Awesome before splitting off to do his own thing. From Dice Funk, Michael "Skitch" Schiciano (seasons 2-4) is credited with the Nostalgia Critic theme. Austin Yorski (seasons 1-4) is editor for Jim Sterling's and Conrad Zimmerman's Fistshark Marketing podcast. Laura Kate Dale (seasons 3-4) is a game journalist for Kotaku UK and stars on another Jim Sterling podcast. Leon Thomas (seasons 1-3) briefly hosted a film analysis show on Channel Awesome before moving to his own YouTube channel. None of these people are appearing on <i>The Late Show</i>, but their names are reasonably well known.<br/><br/>If D&amp;D is rising among pop culture, then I could see it shaping pop culture itself. People that are only famous on the internet are being put on the same playing field as pop culture icons. A new way of playing games is being broadcast to millions, even if it's not entirely representative. Maybe, we see new personalities enter the public consciousness. Maybe, a portion of the community wants to emulate their shows, and turns to story games to do so. Or maybe my experiences are entirely unrepresentative of the greater D&amp;D community. Who knows!<br/><br/><small>Also I was doing this thing where I'd drop hints in my posts that I was an alien locust pretending to be a human that slips in being friends with scary monsters every chance they get and it was gonna be really clever but then that D&amp;D therapy video came and I talked about my real life so if you could just ignore that post plz thx</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyruss" title="Tyruss"><img alt="Tyruss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyruss">Tyruss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468911/#Comment_468911" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-14T18:17:54+00:00" title="January 14, 2018  6:17PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" rel="nofollow">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/profile/FriendlyAlienLocust" rel="nofollow">FriendlyAlienLocust</a> said:<br/><br/>my D&amp;D podcast of choice was <a href="https://austinyorski.podbean.com/" rel="nofollow">Dice Funk</a>. </p></div></blockquote>\nDice Funk is my favorite actual play. I think Dice Funk excels while others fail for three main reasons:<br/><br/>1. Editing<br/><br/>Each episode is 60-90 min long. They clearly put effort into trimming each session down to keep the story flowing. This one is really important to me. I have tried listing to countless actual plays and gotten frustrated with how long everything was taking. When I'm constantly thinking to myself "why didn't you cut this?" I will loose interest and not come back. While admittedly the first two episodes of Dice Funk could have been better edited, on the whole, they do a good job of condensing everything.<br/><br/>2. Not Much Combat<br/><br/>Combat is fun. Listening to combat is not. The creators of the show knew this and even talk about it in episode 1. The stories that are told on the show, don't require much combat so the character's weapons tend to stay sheathed.<br/><br/>3. Player Agency<br/><br/>The players in Dice Funk consistently surprise the DM with the actions their characters make. The DM never says no and always goes along with it. It really feels like the game belongs to the players and that's super satisfying to listen to. Without wishing to spoil, in season three, the characters keep finding smart ways around the DM's obstacles. This eventually culminated in one episode where the DM couldn't contain his laughter and told the party "you guys are better at this game than me."<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468934/#Comment_468934" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T20:27:39+00:00" title="January 15, 2018  8:27PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really good pitch for "Dice Funk"! Sounds like they've put together their show in a really nice way.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I've been thinking about the comments here:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>All us indie designers are secretly just contributing innovations for D&amp;D to half-adopt in 10 years.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p></div></blockquote>\nFunny and true! And as you know, Dave, it\u2019s already happening: inspiration; backgrounds; ideals and bonds; plot-points (in which players take on the role of the GM); I\u2019ve even heard that they discuss something akin to \u201cfail-forward\u201d in the DMG.<br/><br/>These  are some of the same reasons that, although traditional RPG\u2019s aren\u2019t my main interest, 5E is my favorite version of D&amp;D.</div></blockquote>\nThis has inspired me to look through the DMG quickly to see how these various elements are handled.<br/><br/>Some interesting observations:<br/><br/>* The introduction describes some different "player types", and how the DM might engage them. For instance, some players are labeled "actors", and the DM is instructed to "allow them to interact regularly with NPCs". (The use of the word "allow" here is intriguing!)<br/><br/>Notably, some of the bullet points include good advice from a "story gaming" perspective:<br/><br/>"Incorporate elements from their characters' Backgrounds into your campaign" (note that "Background" is a technical term in this version of D&amp;D, and a choice you make in character creation)<br/><br/>"Give the NPCs Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws that the adventurers can exploit" (This is an interesting, and potentially very cool, technique, although I don't see any advice or even an example of what exactly they mean by this)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these are just brief bullet-points in a long list, and let guidance on how to actually choose one over another or how to deal with the conundrum of a group full of players with different interests.<br/><br/>* Also notably, this list includes players who are interested in Fighting and Optimizing. <br/><br/>The DM is instructed to "ensure steady access to new powers and abilities", and to "vividly describe the havoc their characters wreak with their attacks and spells", while "including combat encounters with large numbers of weak monsters" and "interrupting social interaction and exploration with combat".<br/><br/>What I find particularly interesting here is a number of assumptions which appear to be implied. <br/><br/>First, it's the DM's job to figure out how to "allow them to interact with NPCs" while balancing that with "interrupting social interaction with combat", and other balancing acts. The players aren't discussed as having a say in this. It's the DM's job to keep the players engaged and entertained, while satisfying all of these interests (presumably even when they contradict each other). <br/><br/>Second, the DM is told that she must "know the players", but not instructed to ask them or otherwise feel out their preferences.<br/><br/>Third, there is no note of "challenging them"; rather, the focus is always on "letting their characters do awesome things". (You can see this, particularly, in the advice to "include [...] weak monsters" to fight, for instance.)<br/><br/>This paints a very specific picture of what play is supposed to look like. From what I saw of Critical Role, this advice is reflective of the style of play featured in the show. (Or the group is following the advice very precisely; hard to say which, of course.)<br/><br/>* The guidelines for adventure creation have really nice (if somewhat cliche) lists organized in random tables. These include NPCs, adventure hooks, and player goals. (Interestingly, the adventure design process begins by establishing a player goal - notable, since this is supposed to happen before the group gathers to play or make characters. Rolling the "player goal" on a table is suggested as a good practice.)<br/><br/>The "adventure structure" is meant to include an adventure hook (with no mention of what happens if the players do not follow it) and an Adventure Climax. The DM is admonished to make sure the players' choices matter, but, again, the Climax is planned ahead of time, as part of the adventure's design.<br/><br/>It seems to me that a set of random rolls on the tables given for a Goal, Hook, Climax, and so forth, would create a recognizable "D&amp;D adventure" much of the time, although some entries clearly contradict each other. (I tried to roll and I got an adventure where the Player Goal is to "escape from imprisonment" in an underground place, but the adventure hook is that enemies fleeing from the party run into the adventure location. I can imagine making these work, but they aren't always obvious.)<br/><br/>* I found the notes on "failing forward" in an small list of DM tips and tricks in the "Resolution" chapter. The optional rule instructs the DM that when a roll is really close (failed by 1 or 2 points), she can include "success at a cost". Some good examples are given. For instance, a character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but the prisoner gives away its secrets anyway, while shrieking at the top of its lungs, alerting nearby monsters.<br/><br/>* The guidelines on using Inspiration can be summarized as follows:<br/><br/>- It's optional. Only do it if it's more fun.<br/>- Try to award each player Inspiration once per session.<br/>- Use Inspiration to reward behaviours you want to see in your game.<br/>- Reward players when they roleplay in accordance with their Beliefs, Flaws (etc).<br/>- You can use Inspiration to reward the group when they achieve an important goal or victory.<br/><i>- "Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts of the game are their own rewards that don't need incentives like inspiration. If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling the players that your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an impartial role as a rules arbiter. "</i><br/>- There is a variant where players may award each other Inspiration. They may do so once per session, or, in a further variant, any number of times, but doing so allows the GM to give their opponents "advantage" each time they do.<br/><br/>These two pages (out of 320) are the only mentions of Inspiration or character traits I could find in the book. <br/><br/>* The "campaign" chapter includes a note to organize your campaign around a "theme", like so:<br/><br/><i>"A campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the world, but also the beast within- the rage and fury that lies in their own hearts."</i><br/><br/>It doesn't specify why or how you might go about this, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468935/#Comment_468935" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T20:27:46+00:00" title="January 15, 2018  8:27PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2018 8:31PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * The text for "involving your players" in the creation of a campaign says that, once you've got everything set (the setting, adventure, and so forth), you may wish to get their input.<br/><br/>This is almost the entirety of the text (below). It recommends asking questions and accepting the answers ("say yes if you can"):<br/><br/><i>"Once you've identified what your campaign is about, let the players help tell the story by deciding how their characters are involved. This is their opportunity to tie their characters' history and background to the campaign, and a chance for you to determine how the various elements of each character's background tie into the campaign's story. [...] Some players might have trouble coming up with ideas-not everyone is equally inventive. You can help spur their creativity with a few questions about their characters: <br/><br/>Are you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, who's your family? What's your current occupation? Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? Why did you come to this area?<br/><br/>Are you tied to any of the organizations or people involved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are they friends or enemies? <br/><br/>Listen to the players' ideas, and say yes if you can. Even if you want all the characters to have grown up in the starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or a transplant if the player's story is convincing enough. Suggest alterations to a character's story so it better fits your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign into that story."</i><br/><br/>On a quick skim, this is all the "story game"-ish advice I find in the DMG. <br/><br/>There is also the Plot Points optional rule, which allows each player to spend a point to introduce a new narrative element into the story, although (editorializing here, a little more than up until now in this post) it seems so disconnected from everything else that I'd be surprised if many (any?) D&amp;D groups use it.<br/><br/>(Then again, I have yet to see a D&amp;D group use Inspiration for anything other than an occasional XP replacement, anyway.)<br/><br/>Another sidenote: each Background comes with a list of Personality Traits you can roll up randomly or use for inspiration. Looking through them, a handful seem suited to "story game" purposes, but most do not (for instance, a Personality Trait can be something like, "I scowl a lot, rarely laughing or smiling").

have some experience with various rpgs, and I've yet to have any use at all for thespian advice on how to portray a character. That's the sort of thing that has never, ever made nor broken a game for me. Either you have the fundamentals right, in which case the thespian elements flow from <i>those</i> rather than some note made on the character sheet, or you have problems with your fundamentals, in which case thespian detail's just about the last thing you need to worry about. The whole idea is like worrying about which hand you use to roll the dice.<br/><br/>(What those "fundamentals" I mentioned are depends on the game, but in no game I've ever played have they included consciously pre-planning thespian details on player characters and then enacting them at the game table.)<br/><br/>And yes, this is quite out of topic. Sometimes I just get frustrated with the bullshit in rpg books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468940/#Comment_468940" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T20:46:06+00:00" title="January 15, 2018  8:46PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I'm right there with you, Eero.

I mean, the content makes all the difference in the world here. "I am prudish" and "I laugh a lot" have entirely different dramatic weights, for example.<br/><br/>It'd be pretty interesting to make a game that really tried to carry itself on superficial theatrics, and with the players pre-planning those theatrics, too. I suppose it'd have to be a game very much focused on presentation: your job as the player is to deliver this role powerfully, and that somehow matters. The freeform premise would be for it to matter because you want to impress the audience (the other players), but perhaps you could establish some more powerful reward cycles as well.<br/><br/>The GM in many games is in the position of having their delivery matter, by the way. In many narrativist drama games it matters in the sense of influencing play events, but when you do a simmy railroad drama game, you're suddenly in a position where your delivery <i>must</i> work for the players for the game to carry any appeal, or even for it to make any sense as a story: if they don't get that this NPC is a sniveling coward, say, then they can't appreciate it when they get their just desserts later. If they don't grow enamoured of the princess, then what matters when she dies later?

Because when you're rolling up a character without much to go on (e.g. your PC just died and now you're a faceless henchman in the rear row), a little detail like this can give you just enough guidance to create a very rough "persona" and perhaps implies something about the character's background/backstory. He "walks with a limp"? Ok, great, I can use that. Maybe it's an old battle scar...<br/><br/>In a particularly deadly game, where you might only end up playing this character for an hour and then have to make a new one, that's very helpful (and arguably just the right level of detail, along with whatever conclusions you can draw from the ability score rolls).<br/><br/>In a game of epic D&amp;D, though, where I am expected to lovingly craft my Hero as a character over an hour or more, and then play him for dozens of sessions, this seems totally misguided. I don't need to write down that he laughs loudly; but it would be great to figure out the character's values and goals, morals and beliefs, so that the other players (and especially the GM) can use that to inspire their own creative contributions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468951/#Comment_468951" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T23:20:33+00:00" title="January 15, 2018 11:20PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another data point:<br/><br/>I recently joined an ongoing game of D&amp;D5. The DM told me that they love having the Personality Traits, and that they are a really nice touch which adds a lot to the game.<br/><br/>However, once we started playing, the picture, from where I'm sitting, belies that:<br/><br/>* I've never heard anyone reference any Personality Traits at the table.<br/>* No one has ever (since I've joined, anyway) been awarded Inspiration for anything having to do with a Personality Trait. I'm pretty sure they don't plan on ever doing so, either.<br/>* I wrote mine up and sent them to the GM. "Here you go, if you want to do something with that!" He said, "thank you", but it seems pretty clear that there is no attempt to make them relevant to the ongoing story.<br/>* Looking over at my fellow players' character sheets, I don't see anything written in the spot for "Personality Traits" anyway.<br/><br/>From what I'm seeing so far, picturing this as brilliant story-game technology in 'the new D&amp;D' seems a little misguided.<br/><br/>Someone more knowledgeable than I should correct me if I wrong, but in the episodes of Critical Role I watched, I never saw a Personality Trait come up nor Inspiration for such awarded.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the "default" D&amp;D player's approach is to treat the Personality Traits and Inspiration in the same way as the "Plot Points" optional rule - something buried at the back of the DMG that sounds kinda fun, but, you know, isn't really part of the game as far as we're concerned.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468952/#Comment_468952" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T23:20:37+00:00" title="January 15, 2018 11:20PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think those sort of descriptive/behavior traits make good "descriptive hooks" when other people have to narrate your character's presence, and don't want to have to interrupt their descriptions to ask you all these little things about what your character is doing.<br/><br/>But I've never seen games with that sort of dynamic actually mechanicalize these kinds of descriptive shorthand; for games where it's common (online freeform, for example), understanding the other characters so you can use them is more of a basic player skill, and the use of other player's characters is usually negotiated before you write out a scene.<br/><br/>If you wanted to do something that is like online freeform but real-time, in-person, with more improvisation (while attempting to retain the strong focus on "delivery matters"), then I can see these shorthands being very helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468958/#Comment_468958" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T00:58:57+00:00" title="January 16, 2018 12:58AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Picking up on the interesting detour (shouldn't it be a separate topic, though?)

The only deviation from the standard rules was, each player (all of them Italian so far) was instructed to play a soldier born in the actual city or region they were born in real life, and speak in their native regional dialect of Italian exclusively when portraying the character. Players who don't have any native regional dialect - or, absent that, the one player who had the hardest time understanding the others - were cast as low-ranking officers rather than rank-and-file troopers and put in charge of the squad. The use of dialects became the main draw of the game, which was (and still is) in high demand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468974/#Comment_468974" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T18:10:31+00:00" title="January 16, 2018  6:10PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think it'd be cool to have this as a separate thread.

People's reactions are generally similar to ours, with a few "hardcore" fans also chiming in.<br/><br/>Here are a few choice comments, anonymized:\n<blockquote>"Two guys I ran Burning Wheel for got their introduction to roleplaying via Critical Role and Harmon Quest (or whatever it's called). As a GM, it was impossible to fulfill the expectations of those players. I'm worried they want something I cannot provide. I'm incapable of producing nonstop humor or silliness, mainly because I don't come to the table for that. But also because I'm not a trained voice actor or comedian or whatever - I don't have those abilities. I can create drama and some witticisms occasionally, but with every roll and every honeyed word that drips from my mouth? I gotta throw in the towel.<br/><br/>"It probably comes down to play styles. I'm the wrong person to partake in that sort of gaming (either as a player or a facilitator). "<br/><br/>REPLY<br/><br/>"Some people learn about sex from porn, too, with similar results."<br/><br/>REPLY<br/><br/>"That's a clever, if sideways, analogy, ______. I've long agreed with ______'s position that Critical Role and similar shows put on by professional entertainers present a very distorted picture of what happens at most tables. They can be helpful as vaguely aspirational ideals or common reference points to nudge play in a different direction. But I wouldn't steer new players to them as an example of what to aim for."</blockquote>\nLater in the same discussion:\n<blockquote>"I posted about this on another thread, but I'll share here as well as its relevant. Like many, I was initially dismissive of the whole livestream TT RPG thing. Then a friend of mine got invited on, which led to me being pulled in, and I discovered that its not what I thought.<br/><br/>"First, you need to understand there's two types of shows. Though both appear on Twitch, I'll call one Actual Play and one Twitch Show.<br/><br/>"Actual plays are great for showing how a game works. When done right, its an enormous asset for a game. For video games its also the same as an unpolished video walk through. This is what people generally think of as "D&amp;D liveplay" or whatever game liveplay. Personally, its not that entertaining.<br/><br/>"Twitch shows are a different beast. They are done for the entertainment of the audience. I'm sure they initially began as APs, but they morphed into something else entirely. I can't speak for all twitch shows, but most are a variant of what I got sucked into doing on Friday nights.<br/><br/>"For Death From Above: Legacy (a Battletech inspired show), the players get a beat sheet each week that gives a recap for the start of the show, a rundown of what RP scenes we are going to have in the beginning, what the battle scenario is, and then multiple possible outcomes. The only script is for the GM to read or if there is a lore dump that needs to happen. All RP, actions, and dice rolls are done by the players. Where the Death From Above started as game developers from HBS's new Battletech computer game and various Twitch personalities, for the new season and story arc, the players are almost all improv actors and larpers. It also helps that we don't sit; we're standing the whole time.<br/><br/>"But there's something else that happens in Twitch shows: chat happens. Chat is constantly going, interacting with each other, and, through donations, interacting with us. Chat can buy buffs for the protagonists or the antagonists, swinging the fate of the show. For our show, if they donate over $20 they can give a message that is read out by a mechanized voice on the show, and if its an in character message, we try to incorporate it. <br/><br/>"So what you wind up with is really an improv show build on top of the chassis of an RPG and that also incorporates fan interaction. <br/><br/>"And yeah, its pretty awesome. I was nervous as hell in my first appearance (I had a scripted lore dump to give right out of the gate and I'd never done this sort of thing before), but the cast was great and the show's a lot of fun. I also have to admit that last night was amazing, awesome fun, enough so that I rewatched the episode just to see how chat reacted, and it was clear that the fun we had was mirrored by them."</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469006/#Comment_469006" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-18T02:11:36+00:00" title="January 18, 2018  2:11AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2018 1:48AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a more current and more down-to-earth article about the current trend of livestreaming RPG play:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16666344/dungeons-and-dragons-twitch-roleplay-rpgs-critical-role-streaming-gaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16666344/dungeons-and-dragons-twitch-roleplay-rpgs-critical-role-streaming-gaming</a><br/><br/>Notably, this one mentions that D&amp;D is apparently selling more than it ever has, but also that innovations may be on the way: <i>Dread</i>, Emily Care Boss, and Avery Alder are name-dropped towards the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469109/#Comment_469109" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-20T01:24:42+00:00" title="January 20, 2018  1:24AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for providing those quotes, Paul!

However, I got back in pretty heavily in 2016 due to listening to The Adventure Zone podcast (being familiar with a lot of the other media projects of the 3 brothers and father involved in it. TAZ hews closer to mmm, like an improvised radio drama that happens to include RPG elements that a full on actual play RPG podcast? Still, it was enough to get me back into wanting to play RPGs.<br/><br/>Anyway, a lot of the discussion in this thread has really helped me get a handle on why I just cannot seem to get into Critical Role. I tried watching it at least 4 times, and could never make it through the first episode. I saw recently that they were converting it to a podcast version too, and thought maybe the better focus of listening while driving rather than split attention watching it on the computer might help... but still no.<br/><br/>The production/flow is a bit more sleek(not to say it is better... just 1ish hour audio episodes vs multiple hour video episodes) on TAZ than CR, from what I've listened to anyway, and I think the combination of that and already being familiar with the players is why I latched on to TAZ and not CR. I kept coming back to CR because of some people I know, artists I follow on social media, etc. talking about it... but it just doesn't click. I don't know, maybe there is a better place to jump in than the start? And while their voice acting is good, with that many people it makes it really hard for me to follow (which I'm sure would come with time listening, but...)<br/><br/>Anyway, the other podcast I listen to, that really doesn't fit the same mold as these, is Friends at the Table (the GM Austin Walker, was actually one of the players in the video from Waypoint earlier in the thread). The editing and audio quality is a bit shaky in season 1, but it really improves after that. One of the things I really love about it is the shared worldbuilding, Austin asks a lot of questions of the players about the world in addition to the world as seen from their characters point of view. There are entire arcs, regions of the world, important characters, etc. that happen because of answers from players. Along with this, there are <i>a lot</i> of sidebars, digging into elements of the world, characterization, etc. The show is not tightly edited around that stuff, but that is a big part of what I love about it, that's the kind of stuff I love to hit in my play too. It probably doesn't have quite the same mass market appeal as stuff like TAZ and CR because of that, but they've still got a pretty big fan base (fan art, zines, Patreon etc.).<br/><br/>FatT also hits a number of different games throughout the seasons, Dungeon World, Mech noir, The Sprawl, The Quiet Year, Microscope, Kingdom, Follow, Blades in the Dark... and more that I'm missing, and even more in the Patreon only season. For the GMless games that happen within the seasons, Austin generally has some ground rules for the start of the game (like in Follow, what their starting point is), but the rest of the stuff is done pretty much as per usual in the games.<br/><br/>There may have been elements of some of the games they've done that are railroady, but it sure doesn't seem like it. In fact, I think what Austin is much better at is sort of, retroactively laying the tracks. That is, he's great at laying the tracks in between places the story has stopped, after it has already been there, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>They've gotten me to pick up a number of games I might not have otherwise, and I've had a great time with the ones I've gotten to the table (digital or otherwise) so far. And between TAZ and FatT, got me wayyyy back into gaming when I'd been away for quite sometime!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469226/#Comment_469226" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-23T18:23:50+00:00" title="January 23, 2018  6:23PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It seems to me that the "default" D&amp;D player's approach is to treat the Personality Traits and Inspiration in the same way as the "Plot Points" optional rule - something buried at the back of the DMG that sounds kinda fun, but, you know, isn't really part of the game as far as we're concerned. </p></div></blockquote>\nInspiration is a watered-down version of Fate points tacked onto the system. It's terrible and needs a major revision to be worth anything. It more likely seems revolutionary to people whose gaming experience has never tread far beyond the sphere of 3e-style D&amp;D. "I can be rewarded for playing my character? Stunning! Brilliant!" Meanwhile, D&amp;D games continue to follow the system's implicit recommendations and focus on railroaded adventures and monster slaying.<br/><br/>"D&amp;D 5e is about story" means "D&amp;D 5e is less mechanically dense than previous iterations of the game."

And I like how they cooperate as a team, exposing themselves with enthusiasm, contributing to a clear fiction, proposing, mending, tying threads together. Saying Satine or Matt have toothpaste smiles is a shorthand for a playstyle that relies on DM charisma and a high production show. A game of make believe some don't enjoy.

I had heard about it in passing and never really focused on it. Hours of video content that aren't music videos that I can give passing attention to are not usually my thing. I do not like podcasts, either, to further characterize myself.<br/><br/>I don't think I ever posted in this thread. I could be wrong, but I don't feel like checking right now. It'll be interesting if I did post and my views have changed since then.<br/><br/>In the past six weeks or so, I've gone and watched the first three or so episodes from the first season. I liked it. Then I dug around and found some of the key episodes from that season and watched them (without spoilers, a particular character death). I also am watching the new season and am four episodes in so far. <br/><br/><b>My take: This is good entertainment.</b><br/><br/>Without watching the dozens of episodes leading up to the death in season 1, watching the death episode <i>made me cry</i> with them. The role-play was deep and moving. Once I got to know some of the characters, watching them live up to their reputations as they got themselves into different kinds of trouble was lots of fun.<br/><br/>In season two, starting with them from the beginning, I'm enjoying the storyline but I'm also enjoying watching people play D&amp;D. I think the beginning of season one was a bit awkward as Matt and the players found their way and got used to the cameras. The second season is a lot more smooth, yet it still feels like a D&amp;D game with players, not a <i>performance</i> by actors.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>On the other hand, I watched a bit of <i>Critical Role</i>, and I'm a little disappointed by the style of play. It's exactly what I remember of D&amp;D from when I was a teenager, and what a lot of people interested in "story games" were turned off by. People display incredible skill in colourful descriptions, voice acting, and rule mastery. However, it's also full of all the genre tropes, gamer cliches, and counterproductive practices that largely drove me away from D&amp;D in the first place.</p></div></blockquote>\nPaul, I think you just don't particularly like D&amp;D! <br/><br/>It's D&amp;D, so <i>of course</i> it's full of D&amp;D genre tropes and cliches.

Sometimes it's funny, but I found most of it cringeworthy. 3 instances in 7 episodes seems like a lot, but it's probably also only 3 minutes in 24 hours of play.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The DM of the game made a video talking about how to deal with "Player Death" (let's be charitable and assume he meant "character death"). He discusses how difficult and undesireable that can be in a long campaign, but that it's a reality which must be considered, and then described techniques for helping players "get over it". I would have thought that in 2017 a scripted and carefully-considered video about "player death" (ha!) would at least mention the possibility of addressing it via design or gameplay practices, instead of handling it like a dangerous scourge which, like gun crime, alas, isn't wanted but can't always be presented. Not a terribly aware point of view, in my opinion.</p></div></blockquote>\nDo you have a link to that one? I'd love to watch it and see if I have the same reaction as you.<br/><br/>Ultimately, one of the characters does die, though I've heard people's opinions that there's a certain amount of script immunity at play. Personally, I didn't see much that looked like classic illusionism! Definitely in season 2, Matt has a series of events laid out, but the characters go off in strange directions and seem to do their own thing a lot. <br/><br/>The particular death in that campaign was taken <i>really hard</i> by the group of players. Everyone was in tears when it happened, on camera. I think the players thought that Matt would reverse the death somehow and seemed a bit shocked that he was going to let it stand. The players were deeply engaged with their story and characters and it showed.<br/><br/>Should Matt have addressed game design practices? I am tempted to say he's a DM, not a game designer, but he's written a custom 5e class for his games, so he certainly dabbles on the design side (as many DMs do). Are most DMs "aware" of design practices outside of D&amp;D? <br/><br/>Matt has a challenge that I don't have at my table, which is an audience of six million viewers. He must feel a certain pressure to make sure that his games are entertaining to his audience. A character death <i>at the wrong time</i> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> a dangerous scourge to him. It seems that he's also concerned about the emotional well-being of his friends, and is projecting that into this video, but I need to watch it to better guess at his motivation.<br/><br/><br/>#chop#                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471783/#Comment_471783" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-12T20:03:58+00:00" title="April 12, 2018  8:03PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I suppose it's a selfish fear of mine that's rearing its ugly head.

I'm maybe seeing some participationism in that the players know when plot is being dangled in front of them and they latch onto it with a keen eye for story development. I'm also seeing players do things that are way "off script" and that surprise Matt and make him take a step back and figure out what happens as a result.<br/><br/>I think Matt's enormous prep work has contingencies for just about anything a player might do. That isn't railroading, though. When a player does seem to go "off the rails," as it were, Matt doesn't force them back on.<br/><br/>However, certainly in season two at least, the setup of the adventure is such that the players' choices are somewhat limited. A murder happens; the players are there when it happens; the law brands them as suspects; the law also brands NPC friends of two of the PCs as prime suspects; at least two PCs are locked up "under house arrest" for an uncertain amount of time. It's pretty obvious that the PCs will want to clear their names and probably help their friends. The force of law here makes it hard, but not impossible, to just leave town. I suspect Matt was ready for them to try that, and that good play and good dice would let them flee the situation, leaving their NPC friends to twist in the wind. <br/><br/>But adventurers being who they are, it was pretty clear what they'd do, and it became a murder mystery adventure with a trail of clues that Matt left out for them to discover on their own time. <br/><br/><b>Having watched 24 hours of play, I'm comfortable saying that Matt is a great DM.</b> He's prepared and knowledgeable. He has great on-the-fly judgment. He mostly manages spotlight time well, though I think he cares more about audience interest than player interest. He is great at listening and letting players do their own thing without interference. I envy his ability to handle musical selections for mood while running a game! He is fantastic at describing events and portraying NPCs (even without the voices). I am learning things from watching him.<br/><br/>Before <i>Critical Role</i>, Matt Mercer was probably not among anyone's "favorite celebrities." He was a basically unknown voice actor, as are most of the players. Ashley Johnson is the most famous of them. Taliesen Jaffe doesn't do character voices in-game, as far as I can tell, despite being a seasoned voice actor. <br/><br/>Do I "dream of one day gaming that same style"? Not exactly, but man, I wouldn't mind being able to have games as good as those. Those games are amazing. I would love to have long-lasting games that tell stories that enthrall millions of people and deeply engage the players at an emotional level. <br/><br/>Any reaction of "I don't get it" should be taken for what it's worth. Millions of people do get it, so it doesn't matter if you don't or not. <br/><br/>These games are demonstrating perfectly viable D&amp;D play that its audience could replicate to a fair degree with practice and preparation. They'd have a lot of fun.

I enjoyed reading your thoughts, and agree with many of them. I, myself, watched several sessions of Critical Role and found them quite entertaining in many ways (it's only one of two online RPG games I've actually had the patience to sit and watch, so that's saying something!).<br/><br/>My main issue with this whole topic is that... well, it hews to an old tradition in the RPG world, which elevates to "art of GMing" and then produces a variety of (often good) advice which <i>omits the most key elements</i> necessary for successful and high-quality play. I sometimes call it the Mystery GM Cult. GMs (and other authorities) pretend to hand out helpful advice, while leaving many of the most important underlying techniques, principles, and ideas unspoken. I don't even think it's conscious; it's a cultural thing, a way of talking about gaming.<br/><br/>To give you an idea, here's a link to the video on "Player Death" (see the label and dialogue which happens at 0:55 for a real "Dark Dungeons" moment!):<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-Kr0ylBvViU8?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr0ylBvViU8"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Kr0ylBvViU8/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>Note that it's not a discussion of D&amp;D; it's a "GM Tips" channel, which is supposed to teach you "how to GM good". Is it a good overview of "player death" in RPGs?<br/><br/>It has lots of helpful advice on making a beloved hero's death more memorable and handling it gracefully. Great. But what about more important topics? Let's talk about the psychology of the players and the group. Let's talk more about setting expectations. Let's talk about the role of death in process of play. When does it happen, how does it happen, and how do we play and design towards that? What's the difference between a dramatically meaningful death and a pointless one? What do we do if a character dies because of some misunderstanding of the rules, a badly-designed house rule/ruling, a string of unlucky rolls, or a mistake on the part of the GM?<br/><br/>(Not to mention that many of the techniques he describes are things for the *players* to do, not the GM, but they're described as though the GM can just "make them happen". One example is to use the dead character's name as a battle cry when charging into battle - that doesn't sound anything like a GM tip to me!)<br/><br/>Not a single mention of game design, fudging, plot immunity, encounter design, anything? Can we conceive of functional roleplaying where the characters can't die at random? Might that be a good fit for your group? The listener is led to assume that - as the rulebooks state - character death "just happens" in D&amp;D, and it's entirely unpredictable. This is the myth of roleplaying, defended by the Mystery GM Cult.<br/><br/>Matt Mercer ran a several-year long campaign where no one ever died, and then, at the climax of the campaign, a beloved character made an interesting, dramatic choice, which allowed him to meaningfully give up his life to save the day...<br/><br/>Do you really think this happened by coincidence? That Mercer didn't give it a second thought, that the group didn't in any way help that happen? A dramatic death, not driven by the dice, but by an interesting character choice, and at the climax of a years-long campaign. Let's talk about what happens behind the scenes to make that happen. But, no, we must maintain the Mystery Cult - the reason this happened in their game is because Matt Mercer is an Awesome GM, clearly, and if you don't get the same thing in your game, you're just Not as Good at Gaming.<br/><br/>And, if you don't see any Illusionism, take a look at the D&amp;Diesel episode I linked earlier!<br/><br/>Now, I'm exaggerating, of course... a little. But what I see here is a tremendously entertaining campaign which is taking us back to a 1990's mentality about games, gaming, and game design. None of the presentation or the advice is helping people do the same thing at home; there's so much smoke and mirrors that the true activity and how it's done is being hidden.<br/><br/>Have a look at the other videos I linked in this thread and tell me if you think that's the best we can do. In 1990, sure, that was the state of the art. In 2017-2018... it really shouldn't be.<br/><br/>Read the experiences of some of the posters in this thread who are saying they run gaming clubs, and people weaned on Critical Role show up, expect to contribute nothing to the game, and are next to impossible to please.<br/><br/>Matt and the players are superbly entertaining, charming, fun, and great voice actors. So many good things happen in this game and in this show! I even wrote up a breakdown for a friend of mine for why this is fun to watch. However, I feel that they are successful <i>despite</i> the techniques they are using, not <i>because of them</i>. Trying to emulate this style of play, I believe, will lead to unsatisfying, disappointing, or dysfunctional gaming for many (or maybe even most!) people.<br/><br/>For a simple example, notice how Matt occasionally offers players a chance to narrate their own combat actions (like when killing a monster), but then he <i>overrides it with his own narration</i>, every time. He's brilliant and engaging enough to make it work, perhaps, but in the hands of a lesser GM I really don't think that's a good practice.<br/><br/>That's why my relationship with this whole phenomenon is so conflicted. I've been focusing on the negatives here (and particularly so in this most recent post), but I wouldn't be talking at all if it wasn't for all the positives present in this new trend. It's an incredible mix of old and new and strange gaming habits... but it also seems to somehow have missed all the developments and revolutions of the last twenty years in game design and discussion. That leaves me with really mixed feelings about the whole thing.<br/><br/>Thanks again for that review, though. I'll come back and reread it tomorrow! I agree with you far more than you might think.<br/><br/>(Part of it is that much of the interest and development of the story and the characters occurs over the long term, as well. Someone like me, watching just a couple of episodes, won't be seeing some of those long-term developments, which may be more exciting, inventive, dramatic, or player-driven.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471802/#Comment_471802" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T01:08:36+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  1:08AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that D&amp;Diesel episode was <i>awful</i>, but it also wasn't Critical Role. It was a one-shot that put Vin Diesel's witch hunter character front and center as the star of the show. I made no claims about D&amp;Diesel's qualities, though. I'm only talking about CR.<br/><br/>Did the timing of the death in CR happen by accident? I don't know because I didn't watch it all. I do believe that he engineered the lethality level of the campaign to avoid character death at all, and maybe let things get more lethal towards the end when all the chips were in. I don't think that's Illusionist or railroading, just pacing and a campaign choice. In season two, in the party's first "boss" encounter, a character did go unconscious and started making death saves, and the die rolls were in the open. Death seemed to be "on the table," as it were.<br/><br/>I totally do not understand your complaints about the Player Character Deaths video. It's not a complete treatise on all things about PC deaths, and the constant "player deaths" thing is LOLworthy, but we all know what he means, and he never promised the video was the end-all-be-it-all of PC death videos. So the dude isn't up on 21st century game design theory including Story Games discussions and shit. SO WHAT?<br/><br/>I do chafe a bit at how Matt controls all the narrative, but that bit of craziness is actually encoded into the freaking rules on page 6 of the 5e Player's Handbook. It's not how I run things, and I push back at DMs who do this to me when I'm playing, but it's a valid and common play style.<br/><br/>(PHB: "1. The DM describes the environment. 2. The players describe what they want to do. 3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions.") <br/><br/>I haven't seen Matt <i>override</i> a player's narration so much as I've seen him take it as input and restructure it and embellish it. I'm not saying it didn't happen. I just don't remember it happening myself.<br/><br/>"He's brilliant and engaging enough to make it work, perhaps, but in the hands of a lesser GM I really don't think that's a good practice." Okay, so what? Matt isn't saying, "Run games the way I do," and it's not his responsibility to run games the way beginner GMs do. You're really arguing that Matt is such a good GM (in some ways) that he's influencing the hobby in a bad way by his example? I feel like, if you emulate Matt, then you will probably have a fun game. Emulating him requires that you do the things he does, and do them passably well. If you (someone) can't, then you need to find other techniques that work for you. <br/><br/>When you say that the high expectations set by the mystery cult of Matt Mercer will lead to dysfunctional and dissatisfying gaming for all the normal folks, I boggle. It's like criticizing the NBA for ruining basketball for middle school kids. Damn, I hate the Olympics for setting the expectations of amateur ice skaters so high.<br/><br/>When you say that CR is successful despite the techniques they're using, how do you explain that they've been successful episode after episode for about 450 hours worth of gaming. They are having fun. They groan when Matt calls the end of the game night and they have to wait until next week to continue. These are gamers who are also voice actors, not the other way around. These are people who played constantly for two years before Geek &amp; Sundry put them in front of an audience.<br/><br/>You say "it's an incredible mix of old and new and strange gaming habits." I find all of these habits and techniques quite familiar. I've used most of them, for sure, over the decades. As I learned new techniques and developed a different philosophy of gaming, I've moved away from some of those techniques and have adopted a pretty strong anti-Illusionist stance (but Participationism is fine by me) on ethical grounds. <br/><br/>I've played a LOT of D&amp;D, but also a lot of story games. I wonder how many people have the same gaming footprint as me or similar. 20 years of traditional games, deep Forge investment, deep "indie" game investment, then drifting back to traditional games more and more. <br/><br/>But I've played so much D&amp;D that I have a pretty good feel for what Matt is doing on the other side of the table, and I'm not seeing a lot of "GM Force" (illusionism or railroading, more or less). Maybe he's so good at hiding it that I can't tell. Without seeing his prep, I couldn't know for sure. But Illusionism has its tell-tales, and I'm not seeing much of them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471815/#Comment_471815" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T06:14:25+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  6:14AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The D&amp;Diesel episode was a very different kind of video.

I, meanwhile, just watched a few episodes of <i>Critical Role</i>, but I watched a lot of the "Tips" videos, short examples of play, and commentary which surrounds the whole thing. I'm reacting more to the overall phenomenon, and trends I'm seeing, than to <i>Critical Role</i> specifically. <br/><br/>I think <i>Critical Role</i> is a wonderful game/show, in many respects. I've learned things from it and been inspired by it. <br/><br/>What I find odd (and sometimes offputting) is the culture growing around it. It tends to glorify the habits and play culture of what I saw as "the mainstream" back in the 90's, in an entirely uncritical and unenlightened way. Given the modern era of indie games, jeepform, LARP, coherent design, and the OSR, it doesn't represent the variety of gaming out there, nor the better understanding of the process some of us (including yourself) have fought hard to establish. <br/><br/>It makes gaming mysterious and opaque - all things which, in my experience, will often lead people astray. I started roleplaying by trying to emulate this style of play, without any understanding of how it actually works, because the most important details and principles aren't discussed or, often, aren't even <i>allowed to be discussed</i>. That's a terrible recipe for success, and I think it not only occasionally hurts people (or at least their games), but it ultimately drives people away from the hobby.<br/><br/>I think a video about "Player Character Death" which doesn't, even once, mention the design of the campaign, encounter design, the role of dice and randomness, or the possibility that character death can simply be taken off the table, is mind-bogglingly backwards. There's an assumption that character death will be dramatic and weighty and sad, without any discussion of what goes into making that happen. <br/><br/>I recently was invited to play in an ongoing, long-term D&amp;D campaign. It had been going on for almost two years, and the GM's wife was the senior/most important/focal player in the game. At one point, there was a dangerous situation, and the GM's wife said, in a very meaningful tone, "If you kill my character, I'm going to divorce you." There was a lengthy and awkward pause, because no one could tell to what extent she meant it. Finally, the GM said, "No, no, let's see what the dice say..." <br/><br/>But look at that phrase, for a minute. She knows that it's the GM who can/could kill her character in this campaign - not the game, not the natural progression of events, but the GM's choices. The GM, himself, would occasionally make statements to that effect (once, he changed the power level of a dragon in the middle of an encounter, because someone was trying to "metagame" and that annoyed him), but here he's saying it comes down to "the dice", even though many moments in play clearly defy that paradigm (there were many instances while I played with them, not just that one moment with the dragon). As a result, no one has any clue what the actual process of play is, or what's really at stake. <br/><br/>Sure enough, though, the GM pulled his punches and she had no trouble surviving the moment. <br/><br/>I later asked if any characters had ever died in this campaign. Everyone agreed that surely it was possible, and constantly a threat, yes! But, you know, come to think of it, no one could actually remember any such instance. I don't think they liked me asking the question, though.<br/><br/>Incredibly awkward conversations, both those moments, and a total lack of clarity on all sides about what actually happens at the table. Just like my own gaming history in the 90's; I don't want to go back there! I feel that a video like the ones I've linked to only perpetuates this non-self-aware style of gaming and communication. Sometimes overtly, sometimes in non-obvious ways.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine ever having such an awkward moment at the table in your D&amp;D game, by comparison. (For those who don't know, Adam runs an awesome D&amp;D campaign online called "Mirrorrim", and I've played in it briefly.) You lay out the way play works and set clear expectations every step of the way. For me, that's a <i>very</i> dramatic difference. If people were watching and admiring Mirrorrim, that would make me far happier!<br/><br/>This all sounds very strong, of course. I have to use strong words here and there, to get my point across. In the end, I realize that it's all just playing games, though, and I should clarify that I'm discussing some fairly fine points. It's not a crime or a tragedy; just an odd trend I didn't expect. Much of this comes down to personal preference, in the end. However, reading through this thread you'll see a lot of people relating experiences which suggest there are negative effects - like whoever it was who said that people weaned on Critical Role are often sources of trouble at their game club. That worries me a little.<br/><br/>To use your NBA analogy, it's not that I think watching people play at a high level will "ruin" people's home games. It's that, were NBA players misleading people about their training process, or at least unwilling to discuss it, and their statements were likely taken as gospel by a large portion of the population, that would be disappointing to me. For instance, if Matt Mercer were to make a video explaining how he handles encounter balance and design for the <i>Critical Role</i> campaign, and how he (and/or the players) worked together to create that dramatic choice in the end, that would be way more interesting and way more useful. I suspect he might operate on the basis of a principle like, "When running your game, make sure that any potential for death comes with a meaningful choice for the player, so that, if they die, it will mean something," for example. Is he reading the table's mood and the players to decide when bringing in such stakes is appropriate? If so, how? What did he see, and what helped contribute to building that memorable moment in play?<br/><br/>Now that would be some great content...<br/><br/>You know, actually give us some thoughts and some tools for doing what you're doing, help others get more out of their games. Making "GM Tips" videos while leaving out the actual practice and the actual techniques is disingenuous, in my opinion.<br/><br/>So, where does that leave me?<br/><br/>Overall, I've tried to make this discussion more about my befuddlement with this whole phenomenon, and my mixed feelings. One part surprise, one part disappointment, one part total admiration. If it's coming across as non-stop condemnation, I've gone wrong somewhere.<br/><br/>However, I far prefer the modern, enlightened approach to gaming I've seen in games like yours, and I'd like to continue to see more of that. Someone like Adam Koebel does a lot to contribute to that (like doing his game prep in public, for each session), and the same goes for Matt Colville's channel. <i>Critical Role</i>, though, is a very different beast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471878/#Comment_471878" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T18:38:28+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  6:38PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like you're condemning it, yes. I think Sandra thinks so, too.<br/><br/><b>I don't have any real stake in it.</b> I like the show. I think it's good. I went and watched the first episode purely because you mentioned it here in November and I wanted to see if all the vitriol I was seeing here was warranted. And I came away with the opinion that, no, it's not at all. <br/><br/>I do rankle at a sort of gatekeeping / elitism I'm smelling here. I feel like "I don't like this" is turning into "This is bad."<br/><br/>But I'm not a superfan or anything. I've watched 6-7 episodes, mostly when I had the flu, and I have a hard time justifying 4 hours a week on a single show.<br/><br/>*  *  *<br/><br/>Why do I think you and others are condemning it?<br/><br/>1. You are calling it Illusionism. I haven't really seen it in CR. In Witch Hunter, sure. <br/><br/>2. Even just now, in the context of the "Player Character Death" video, you call Matt Mercer (or his video) "disingenuous." That suggests a motive that I don't think Matt has at all. I think he wanted to tell people that PC death at the table can be hard, and suggest some ways to deal with it. Why doesn't he cover HOW PC death happens or how to avoid it? Because that's not what the video is about, that's all. If you were watching a video on how to make free throw shots in basketball, it's like you're complaining that they didn't talk about diet and workout regimen, because obviously that stuff is vital to being a good basketball player. Well, sure, but that's a bigger topic, and this video is about free throws. You're really suggesting that Matt should be questioning the entire premise of D&amp;D game design, aren't you? Doesn't that seem a bit too far? "The dude made a GM tips video and didn't go far enough" seems pretty demandy!<br/><br/>3. You just used a terrible husband-wife favoritism/illusionism anecdote as an analogy to CR. Do you really think Matt is doing that in his games?<br/><br/>4. If it's about the phenomenon around CR, and not CR itself, then why do you keep bringing up CR's play techniques? Do you think Matt and CR have a responsibility to correct how their content is consumed? How much of one? If it turns out Matt is not using GM Force / illusionism techniques at all, but players think he is and emulate bad behaviors they're falsely attributing to him, is that his fault? <br/><br/>So as you're saying your reaction is mostly befuddlement with the whole phenomenon, I'll say that my reaction is mostly befuddlement with the perceived condemnation against it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471881/#Comment_471881" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T19:23:13+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  7:23PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>I feel like we're really miscommunicating now, and I'm not sure how to fix it. I just reread all my posts in this thread, and I feel like they're mostly full of observations and questions - mostly, a mix of genuine befuddlement, appreciation/admiration, and some questions about how other people are seeing this cultural phenomenon.<br/><br/>My comments about Illusionism generally have to do with the wider phenomenon of a particular style of "traditional RPG gaming", not <i>Critical Role</i> itself (and I was careful to say "Participationism or Illusionism" in most of my posts until the last couple). They are far more relevant to the various advice videos and short bits of sample play (like the Vin Diesel video) than to <i>Critical Role</i>. <br/><br/>I think there are lots of clues that <i>Critical Role</i> leans in that direction - the consistency of outcomes, the canned content (Mercer often reads descriptions and dialogue he has prepared), Mercer's own tips videos which make it fairly clear that the plot he wrote is what will happen in play, and so forth - but I'm not necessarily condemning that.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if that got all mixed up in there. <br/><br/>There are some other aspects - generally minor ones, like modern D&amp;D culture's total avoidance of actually answering the "character death" question, what it means, and when it might happen - which I stand by, however. (If you feel like you want to address your specific questions, above, let me know, I can do that.)<br/><br/>The intent of this thread was to poll people's opinions on this new culture of D&amp;D in the spotlight, celebrity gamers, and play which is intended for audiences. It's all new to me and I'm still processing it. I don't think that pointing out some of the potential problems with, say, celebrity culture, should be taken as a condemnation of a game which I myself raved about when introducing it.<br/><br/>If I came across that way, I apologize. I'm trying to raise questions and to poll readers, not condemn anything or anyone. The idea of a "celebrity culture" around D&amp;D in the 21st century is still coming as a shock to me, given that during most of my years surrounded by games and gaming I've heard about the 'death of the hobby' and how it will be replaced by computer games for sure any day now, over and over, year after year. This thread shows me struggling with this idea and exploring it.<br/><br/>I actually really appreciated your posts here - a more positive review was a welcome counterpoint to some of the other things which have been said by other posters, and, again, I agree with almost everything you wrote. There's a lot to admire and emulate in <i>Critical Role</i>! My concerns have little to do with that show in particular, and more with the potential impact of the cultural phenomenon on gaming in general. Mostly, the impact is really positive; however, there are some aspects which seem to me to be slightly retrograde. My hope is that we should be able to discuss possible negatives of a thing without taking sides on the thing itself. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471883/#Comment_471883" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T19:38:46+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  7:38PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we're all good!

If I was taking sides at all, it's because you seemed to be attacking a thing and no one was defending the thing, and I stepped up to "champion" it because I thought you were wrong.<br/><br/>I'm super curious about the quality of the GM advice videos now. I won't be surprised if they're shit, because all GM advice videos are shit. &lt;=)<br/><br/>I'd also say that, if Matt is openly saying in his videos that he's using illusionist techniques, then you can be pretty sure that his players know it, so it's really participationism and I have no issues with it at all.<br/><br/>I don't know if our hobby is really dying, but something like CR breathes new life into it. That means it might go in directions we don't like and we'll get relegated to a curious footnote in history. I'm fine with that, really. I can have my fun and watch millions of new faces have their fun.<br/><br/>I wouldn't at all characterize the negatives you're seeing as "retrograde." If anything, they're the state of the art. That's how people play D&amp;D all the freaking time, maybe slightly less "hi-def" than Matt's slick presentation. In the past couple years, I've walked away from tables where the GM narrated boring stuff for 45 minutes without any player interaction. I've asked a GM if I could narrate my own character actions and gotten begrudging and irritated "permission" to do so. Matt Weber actively fucks with GMs who try to railroad him, and this isn't hypothetically. That "retrograde" GM style is still deeply ingrained in the modern gamer psyche. <br/><br/>The storygaming community has made small inroads into expanding the consciousness (or whatever) of people in our hobby, bringing enlightenment to all those unwashed gamers, but generally, gaming hasn't changed that much in the last 15 years, maybe in its history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471891/#Comment_471891" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T20:23:48+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  8:23PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2018 8:28PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All true!*<br/><br/>One thing I've seen people struggle with (in terms of separating them) is what about the "old days" was good (because it was new, perhaps because of childlike wonder, or just nostalgia) and what was bad (because we were young and experienced and didn't know what we were doing, perhaps). Compared to "gaming now", either can seem like a consequence of the times, of "modern design", the new edition of D&amp;D, or whatever people want to blame. In reality, though, it can be heard to tell whether it's not just a question of you and your gaming friends growing up.<br/><br/><br/>*: No, one thing isn't true. Or, rather, you might be misreading me. You wrote: "I wouldn't at all characterize the negatives you're seeing as "retrograde." If anything, they're the state of the art." <br/><br/>I'm not saying that playing D&amp;D the way they are on Critical Role is "retrograde". I don't believe in BadWrongFun, right? Play the way you want to play, it's all good. What I'm calling "retrograde" is the lack of clarity in communicating about it; we've seen (largely thanks to the Forge and other important influences) great progress in discussing gaming frankly and with clarity over the last 15-20 years, and I don't see that in the culture surrounding Popular D&amp;D Culture these days. I miss it.<br/><br/>For instance, when I join your D&amp;D game, I know exactly how it will go down, the aims and goals of the game are clear, and the expectations are well set. With the other D&amp;D campaign I joined (which was very similar to <i>Critical Role</i>, in a general sense - part of the same culture, in a broader sense, though not intentionally so, as they weren't fans) none of those expectations were clear at all, and the game suffered for it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/manixur" title="manixur"><img alt="manixur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/manixur">manixur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471905/#Comment_471905" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T23:50:27+00:00" title="April 13, 2018 11:50PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And the end of the day, it sounds like the Mystery Cult issue is less what's done on the show, and more how it's communicated.

Keep in mind that, when I say "illusionism" below, I really mean participationism, because I cannot imagine that his players do not know at this time exactly how he runs his games.<br/><br/><br/><b>Episode: Building RPG Encounters</b><br/><br/>Matt mentions that sometimes it's fun to have the party meet a monster that they just can't kill, so they can escape and come back after they're tougher. Is this railroading? I don't think so. He does say to give them some warning that it's not a winnable encounter, "or you might have a TPK on your hands." He's absolutely not advocating pulling punches with the encounter here. Give the players a fair warning, then let the cards fall where they may.<br/><br/><b> How To Create Non-Player Characters for RPGs </b><br/><br/>Matt talks about keeping a note on disposition toward the party (hostile, indifferent, etc.) and how the party can change that. He's using game systems (and player RP and dice rolls) to determine how NPCs react to players.<br/><br/>Also, he says you can make combat stats up on the fly, but he prefers having something solid, on paper. That is, if there's a decent chance that an NPC may end up in combat with a PC (ally or enemy), he trusts to his prep.<br/><br/>He talks about building villains with deep backstories and "peppering" clues towards a "long reveal." This is definitely <i>storytelling</i>, but I don't think it necessitates railroading. He also says "let the villain have a grandiose death, no matter how attached you are." That is, no railroading to avoid the PCs killing your darlings. "Sometimes a final encounter isn't as epic as you think, and you don't want to steal that from the players..."<br/><br/><b>Preparing for the Unexpected</b><br/><br/>"Players will break plots that are too rigid." "Players will break plots" is a bit of an illusionism <i>tell</i>. So is, "You can start preparing a little bit, some alternate paths from the main story that you've been developing." <br/><br/>His actual advice is to think about what players might do and be prepared to change with them, though. "You don't want to deny the players their actions. . . For the most part, you want to let them go along with their choices, as cockamamie and weird as they may be, because those will make for some of the <i>best</i> stories, for one." That is, the <i>players</i> will make the best stories, not him as DM.<br/><br/>"You don't want to railroad the players too much." Too much? How much is okay? "And you will be able to keep them on that story path, for the most part . . . but if they veer a little bit, left and right, let them steer out of the way, let them find some weird side elements, and you can always <i>guide them</i> back in slowly. But don't try and <i>force</i> them on that particular past."<br/><br/>So Matt has a story arc in mind. He uses his knowledge of the players and their characters to drop hooks in their way so his story gets told, but sometimes they don't bite or they go their own way. He's fine with that, but gently guides them back to his story only.<br/><br/>He also talks about having a page of "plot hooks" that can be attached to any character. This is a little bit, "all roads lead to Rome" in a railroading sense, but it's also kind of "bandolier of bangs" in the Sorcerer RPG sense.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Which raises the question, how much plotting can you do without it being illusionism?<br/></span><br/><br/><b>Building RPG Social Encounters</b><br/><br/>The nature of his deep prep of NPCs and factions for social encounters doesn't speak for or against illusionism.<br/><br/>"Find moments or points in the story where you can up the ante and raise the tension." Again, neither for nor against, but definitely pushing toward an idea of <i>story</i>.<br/><br/>He also talks about cascading PC consequences, which is a technique lots of people use. <br/><br/><b> The Rule of Cool</b><br/><br/>"A willing suspension of disbelief, for the sake of a cool moment." Specifically, should you let PCs do things that the rules don't specifically allow, because the actions are cool?<br/><br/>Here he puts the DM in the role of gatekeeper of setting consistency and mood, and sees the "crazy" narration of players as having its place, but as something that the DM needs to keep in check to keep some kind of tension in the game. If the players feel they can do any crazy thing they want, he argues, nothing will be scary in the setting. He is talking about crazy things that players want to do <i>outside the rules,</i> mind you, not the stuff the rules let them do. Basically, "bend the rules to let them do the cool things they want to do."<br/><br/>He also talks about rewarding players who don't "try and break your game." Is this subtle psychological conditioning to let players know how to play "right" in a railroaded game? I don't think so, because then he talks about game-breaking entirely in terms of players who constantly want to reach outside the rules and bend them to do more and more beyond their PC's abilities.<br/><br/>Regarding them trying heroic actions: "Let them occasionally succeed. (Occasionally!)" If he was talking about controlling success/failure of normal, in-game actions, I'd stamp this as pure illusionism, but he was just talking about players doing stuff the rules don't already allow (the crux of the Rule of Cool). And he just said it might require a skill check. I don't think he sees this as a tool to control narrative, but rather a set of techniques to allow player creativity way outside the rules without the game falling part.<br/><br/>"And as long as you do it in a creative and respectful way that doesn't, you know, damage or disrespect the time and energy the DM has put into the narrative..." Yikes. This one <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> a bit "don't break my story, players." <br/><br/><b>RPG Etiquette</b><br/><br/>"...to fit their story, their world..." Another illusionism <i>tell</i>.<br/><br/>"Your players are the life's blood of your world. They are the ones that make this story that you wrote and bring it to life and play it through and hang onto your every word and they are essentially letting you scoop them up and take them into your imagination, and that's a lot of trust there." More "DM tells the players a story."<br/><br/>(Ironic voice:) "You're the game master. You rule the world. You are the god of this whole experience!" I think he's mimicking what other people say, but maybe he believes it, too?<br/><br/>Earlier (or maybe in an earlier video), he worded it as "The DM has final say," which is a different take on the DM's role than "You are the god..."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472022/#Comment_472022" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-15T23:45:13+00:00" title="April 15, 2018 11:45PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Rewarding Your Players</b><br/><br/>He talks about reward schedules to keep things "cool" and to "control that spigot." This is classic D&amp;D advice to DMs. It's not illusionism, though the "rare keeps it cool" suggests a story tie.<br/><br/>One of the headlines says, "Gifts from gods, aliens, and superbeings add to a character's abilities and storyline," suggesting DM control or influence of a PC's storyline.<br/><br/>The last part talks about how you can use rewards to open up areas of the world that the PCs previously were kept out of. This is a GM Force technique to control story pace, absolutely. He repeatedly uses the term "The Story" in this context. He pretty clearly has a story path of his own that he's guiding characters down. <br/><br/><b> Frequently Asked Questions about RPGs </b><br/><br/>"So, like, is your Critical Role story homebrew? Yes. I created it from the ground up, for better or for worse, and I'm still developing as we continue playing the game." If he meant backstory or setting, then it's less likely that he'd still be making it up. I'm not entirely sure what he means by "story" here though.<br/><br/>When talking about folks at home setting games in Tal'Dorei, Matt warns that his world may change in weird ways unexpectedly, depending on what the players do. One point for non-illusionism here.<br/><br/>He also talks a lot about improv techniques ("Yes, And...").<br/><br/>Making his games "immersive" is a priority.<br/><br/><b>Improv and the Unexpected</b><br/><br/>He talks about how you have plans for stories, but the players do all kinds of crazy things and make it different and better. And to embrace their actions and let it go.<br/><br/>"So after you've worked on and knocked out your main story thread and through line, I would recommend taking a little time to loosely develop some side plots that may lead back to the main story possibly." These are tools for him to use "should the party deviate too far from the main story." Definitely railroading technique here.<br/><br/><b>Improv and the Unexpected</b><br/><br/>Great advice, nothing relevant to my topic.<br/><br/><b>How to Customize Creatures</b><br/><br/>This is a lot of advice about carefully tailoring encounters to a player group. Definitely not sandbox-style play. He talks about "an unfair TPK," so this is a matter of fairness to him, probably, not story driving.<br/><br/>At the end he talks about an "unintentional TPK when you were just trying to get them in the mood," suggesting he thinks of his DM role as that of a movie director.<br/><br/><b>Creating Magical Items</b><br/><br/>He uses component requirements for PC-crafted items as a pacing mechanism for how fast they get those items, regardless of the rules for crafting.<br/><br/>Otherwise, all fine, non-illusionist advice.<br/><br/><b>Fixing GM Mistakes</b><br/><br/>"Being the game master for an entire world, guiding heroic players through stories from inside your mind, can be an incredibly fun and rewarding experience."<br/><br/>Well, that's at <i>least</i>, The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast.<br/><br/>The "GM mistakes" he lists are things where he fails to control "the story." "How do you correct these unintentional errors to maintain the game you wanted to run?" Ack.<br/><br/>Accidental TPK? Some of his solutions are pure illusionism (the <i>deus ex machina</i>); some aren't. <br/><br/>"If the encounter is <i>intended</i> to be dangerous, challenging, and possibly deadly, let the dice fall as it may. That's part of the game. You don't want to undermine the ever-present danger and tension of the game. However, you also don't want to completely end the story that you and your players have put into for months and months, due to just an unexpectedly shitty scenario."<br/><br/>He talks about reveals and hints to nudge the players towards plot. Or to "tailor or shuffle" plot points.<br/><br/>Discontinuity in plots due to mistake can be attributed to an NPC who gave them info now retroactively being untrustworthy. <br/><br/>Magical weapons that turn out to be too powerful can be cursed or dangerous, retroactively. <br/><br/>Basically, don't admit plot mistakes. Retroactively use GM Force to hide them and keep the world consistent. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472023/#Comment_472023" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T00:01:01+00:00" title="April 16, 2018 12:01AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            13 episodes in, I think he's definitely using a lot of illusionist / participationist techniques.<br/><br/>He sees his role as delivering an epic story to the group. However, he also feels that his story must include the hooks that the players gave him in their character backgrounds and be prepared for PCs to veer off the DM's story path. He offers tools to gently guide them back. When the players discover plot holes or logical inconsistencies, or if he gives out an item that's too powerful, or if an unimportant combat encounter becomes deadly, he uses GM Force to change events.<br/><br/>It's fairly clear that he has a sort of system in his mind for when to do this. I think, as long as the story is super cool, he'll go with it. If the story starts failing (in the ways that stories fail), then he steps in and uses only as much GM Force as needed to put things "right." <br/><br/>Now, we know that characters can die, but he brings up TPK a few times as a horrible thing. This is understandable. His story can survive the death of a character or two. The deaths will be dramatic and sad and part of a great story, especially if they happen at the right time. However, if <i>everyone</i> dies, then the story -- everyone's story -- ends. <br/><br/>Everything he does is slave to Story, but he sets himself up as final arbiter of what will make a good story. Players should contribute to it, so it's not entirely "Matt's Story." I think this is an important point to note.<br/><br/>I think, as long as the story is entertaining for everyone, Matt lets whatever happens in-game happen. Side quests are fine, but considered entertaining distractions. Unexpected player actions are great, so long as they don't "break the game" -- maybe that's rules, but maybe it's plot-break, too.<br/><br/>Any action that threatens the plot structure Matt has in mind for the game is likely to be shut down with GM Force, subtly at first, and less and less subtly if that fails. He's already prepared ways to guide the PCs back to the "through line" of his story. <br/><br/>For the most part, the players <i>want</i> to be on that through line. For one, it's hella entertaining and a big part of why the game is fun for them. For two, they have learned that they'll end up there anyway. For three, they get rewards when they are on the right path; no rewards (and the risk of danger for little reward, which is a kind of punishment), when they stray. But I think he also carefully sets up his adventure introductions against the party's motives and backgrounds to be "sticky." <br/><br/>That is, if they play to character as they've written them, they'll likely do whatever it is Matt wants them to do. But more charitably, he's tailored "the story" perfectly to the characters that they wrote. <i>Of course</i> they want to find the villain who murdered their friends; of course they want to clear their name and get out from under house arrest. Is that GM Force in a bad way, or just the GM writing the player's Kicker for them in a way that serves the GM's plot?<br/><br/>Once again, I'm pretty sure that some or all the players have seen Matt's GM Tips videos, too, so his GM Force techniques are done with their knowledge. That would make this willing participationism instead of unwilling illusionism, and I have no problem with the former.<br/><br/>He never makes it clear that he has their buy-in though, or when they bought in. Any new GM watching these advice videos will learn the Force techniques without learning they should have buy-in. Matt doesn't even appear to believe he needs buy-in, so maybe early games were purely hard-core Illusionism.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

It's not all-or-nothing. Of course, if the GM is hiding from you how much agency you really have, or is cherry picking moments to take agency away from you, you might as well suspect you have none.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472045/#Comment_472045" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T15:25:26+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  3:25PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I guess I'm a bit of a noob around here since I don't know my <i>Sorcerer</i> too well.

It has to be something that is interesting to everyone, and which the character can't simply ignore. (Rather, ignoring it would be a super interesting choice that says a lot about the player, and consequences would cascade as a result.) Then the GM pushes hard at that situation and play focuses on finding out what happens. <br/><br/>The idea is that the GM isn't writing a story for the characters. The players aren't writing the story in advance, either. Once a player resolves her character's Kicker, she writes a new one. It takes one or more play sessions to resolve a Kicker, probably. <br/><br/>\u201cThe writer\u2019s job is to get the main character up a tree, and then once they are up there, throw rocks at them.\u201d\u2013Vladimir Nabokov<br/><br/>In a sense, the player is chasing their own character up a tree. It's the GM's job to throw rocks after that.<br/><br/>And that leads us to <b>Bangs</b>, which are hard situations. The GM prepares a bunch of meaty situations to throw at each character. Sometimes players come up with them, too. By "meaty," I mean that they reinforce the themes of the game and the development of the characters and the idea behind the Kickers. <br/><br/>Bangs are resolved in a conflict roll or two or three. They're not as long-lived as Kickers. <br/><br/>Together, Kickers and Bangs drive play forward. The player chooses a Kicker and thus the direction of play for their character. The GM has no choice but to build play around that player's choice. Bangs are incremental conflicts that tie everything together, pushing at the space around the Kicker's thematic issues and testing the character's resolve.<br/><br/>Other people may have clearer explanations of these things, or may correct me on my explanations. I've played Sorcerer a few times, read it many times, studied it a lot, but I'm not an expert.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472057/#Comment_472057" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T16:53:47+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  4:53PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2018 4:55PM by Vivificient.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, that is a very clear explanation.\n<blockquote>Plot hooks and looking for buy-in in story-first designed, trailblazing/participationist scenarios are nowhere remotely like bangs and kickers in the very different context of an orthodox Sorcerer game, are they?</blockquote>\nSo if I understand correctly, in both Sorcerer and the technique Matt Mercer is (possibly?) suggesting, the DM is thinking about the motives of the PC and making up situations to throw at them, but the key distinction is between (1) choosing situations because they will be interesting to explore regardless of the outcome; vs (2) choosing situations in order to lead the player to a certain planned outcome. <br/><br/>Edit to add: I'm pretty quiet because I don't know if I have much to add, but I am enjoying this thread and have found all the commentary and discussion very interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472074/#Comment_472074" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T18:23:14+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  6:23PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>An excellent analysis! I agree in full, with one caveat:<br/><br/>I don't see any evidence that any of these techniques are transparent to the players or the group at all. The GM Tips, for instance, were all made *after* running, say, Critical Role, and in the moments where the use of Illusionist techniques is clear (like in the shorter examples of play, e.g. with Vin Diesel) we can see that there's no buy-in or clarification.<br/><br/>Edit: Another point is the use of canned material in the game (he often reads from prepared text, and not for room descriptions, but, for example, the death of a monster). It's another "tell", as you put it. Like the others, not necessarily anything terrible on its own, but it fits the picture.<br/><br/>That last video, in particular, was the one I was reacting to ("Write One-Shot RPG Campaigns"), so it may help for you to understand my reaction better when that was the first one I watched after the "Player Death" video.<br/><br/>I don't have a *huge* problem with this style of play. I think it can be fun, and Mercer does an amazing job with it. I'd probably have a good time as a player in his group.<br/><br/>There isn't even necessarily wrong with people playing in this style together, right? It's a free world, we can all do what we want.<br/><br/>However, I do think that:<br/><br/> a) it's a shame that this new culture around D&amp;D play doesn't even touch on other ways to play the game, either as openly Participationist, sandbox/adventure with a "let the dice fall where they may" approach, a player-driven narrative, or otherwise, and<br/><br/>b) that new people introduced to gaming via Critical Role and then videos like these are at least somewhat likely, I think, to learn <i>all the wrong lessons</i> from them.<br/><br/>(For instance, I think the "Write One-Shot Campaigns" video is intended for beginners.)<br/><br/>My point a), above, is what I meant by "retrograde", earlier. It's 2018, but this advice sounds exactly like mainstream RPG advice given in the early 90's to me.<br/><br/>I've learned a lot of cool stuff by <i>watching</i> Mercer run his game, and admire his skills, but I don't find the videos to be exceptional GM advice at all. Like you say, for example, the lack of interest in getting buy-in from the players for some of these techniques... is a little short-sighted, I feel.<br/><br/>Now, go watch the OTHER GM Tips videos, not by Mercer by Phoenix et al. (after his series ends), and you'll understand my concerns, perhaps, even better. (I linked to a few earlier in this thread.) Much of my negative reaction, such as it was, was based on those, far more than <i>Critical Role</i> or anything to do with Matt Mercer.<br/><br/>Thank you for that lovely review - it was a fascinating read for someone who doesn't have the patience to watch all of them. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472077/#Comment_472077" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T18:28:04+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  6:28PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" rel="nofollow">Vivificient</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>So if I understand correctly, in both Sorcerer and the technique Matt Mercer is (possibly?) suggesting, the DM is thinking about the motives of the PC and making up situations to throw at them, but the key distinction is between (1) choosing situations because they will be interesting to explore regardless of the outcome; vs (2) choosing situations in order to lead the player to a certain planned outcome.</p></div></blockquote>\nYou understand correctly, plus in (1), players have continual agency over the story.

They're very entertaining, but most of the guest GMs seem to believe that they have to entertain the players with a great story, and that they're licensed to manipulate events at the table to make their own story happen.<br/><br/>And really, I think they <i>are</i> "licensed" to do that (by the culture -- and by the rules as written to some extent).<br/><br/>As I've said, I personally have an ethical problem with illusionism only as so far as the GM is doing something that the players don't know about. But if everyone in the culture believes the GM's role is to do exactly this, it's participationism by default. I have no issues with that, at large, though I get annoyed as a player in games where I have little real player agency.<br/><br/>I'm still not convinced that the new Critical Role fanbase is learning "all the wrong lessons." There's nothing wrong with this kind of participationist-by-default play. People are getting inducted into our hobby. They'll have lots of fun, probably. If they end up at my table, I'll show them a different way to play. It's all good!<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that any newb gamer who goes digging for D&amp;D stuff will eventually fall into OSR hands and see some stuff that looks familiar and some stuff that seems totally foreign (prep-first dungeon crawls, hex crawls, etc.). <br/><br/>Also, I think that people who really really like Critical Role are self-selecting for this kind of story-first play, so they'll likely not have any problem with GMs who run games this way. In fact, they may be dissatisfied with sandbox-style play that doesn't tell an epic story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472083/#Comment_472083" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T18:51:17+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  6:51PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2018 6:52PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also:<br/><br/>Adam, that one of the most concise and most effective summaries of Kickers and Bangs I've ever heard. Nice! <br/><br/>The GM's job is to throw rocks... indeed!<br/><br/>I'll add, for the reader entirely unfamiliar with <i>Sorcerer</i>:<br/><br/>The <b><i>Kicker</i></b> is analogous to the "inciting incident" in a major character's story. Something happens, and we know that their life can never be the same. For Frodo, it's learning that he has the One Ring and that the Black Riders are on their way to find it - and him. He has to do something now! The story has begun.<br/><br/>Important for the newbie here to understand is that, while the GM in Sorcerer has the full range of authority and techniques available to them that any other GM does, the Kicker is the thing which, to a large extent, determines what the character's story <i>is</i>, and THAT is player-authored.<br/><br/>If our game was <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, to follow the example, it would have been the player who invented the Ring, its importance to the Dark Lord, Gandalf, the Black Riders, and all the rest. That makes the dynamic very, very different from a typical D&amp;D game adventure where the GM presents the story and the players are participants in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472104/#Comment_472104" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T19:27:41+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  7:27PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.  You know, a lot of the examples of "Bonds" in the backstory section of the 5e player handbook <i>do</i> essentially authorize the player to make up something like a Kicker for their character.  E.g., for the noble, "I am in love with the heir of a family that my family despises."  Or for the hermit, "My isolation gave me insight into a great evil only I can destroy."<br/><br/>Except then the assumption is not that you will go explore the results of this exciting thing, it is that you will go play the module the DM has prepared (or the hardcover adventure they have bought, which is maybe the baseline assumption on which the 5e rules are based).  It is a bit of an odd tension in the rules, like half of a subsystem with the other half missing.<br/><br/>As far as I can remember there is nothing in the Dungeon Master Guide advising the DM to create circumstances related to the dramatic backstory set up by the player and throwing them at the player.  You are supposed to award inspiration if people roleplay in a way that shows their bond, implying it is wholly on the player to do something with their backstory.  (Although it is optional to have such a dramatic situation in your bond, since half the examples are more like "I really love my favourite lute.")<br/><br/>On the other hand I recall that in the 5e Starter Kit adventure (Phandelver), they provide pregenerated characters who each have a bond related to the main goal of the adventure, thereby assuring a connection between the character backstory stuff and the meat of the adventure, a connection that won't exist if the players are making up their backstory and then the DM is separately making up a adventure module.<br/><br/>So, maybe that is why people come up with brilliant tips about how the DM should make up a grand linear story while incorporating player's backstories.  It helps tie up some of the weirdly half-baked story-game threads that were sown into the Player's Handbook and then ignored, and which otherwise will seem contradictory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472106/#Comment_472106" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T19:41:33+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  7:41PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2018 7:44PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">@Vivificient</a>,<br/><br/>You might consider copying and pasting that comment over in this thread:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21584/d-d-5e-in-favor-of-inspiration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21584/d-d-5e-in-favor-of-inspiration</a><br/><br/>We're getting into that stuff in much more detail there!<br/><br/>Like you say, the problem is that... \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" rel="nofollow">Vivificient</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It is a bit of an odd tension in the rules, like half of a subsystem with the other half missing.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nIn <i>Sorcerer</i>, the GM is explicitly instructed to use the <i>Kicker</i> as the basis of the character's story.<br/><br/>In <i>D&amp;D</i>, more often than not (in my experience, anyway), that Bond will never show up in play.

Even if you look at the examples in the <i>Apocalypse World</i> book, you'll see the "GM" in the examples talking quite openly about such things (e.g. "no, no, that was just misdirection - I'm making my move now..."). <br/><br/>I don't see any obfuscation happening - it's just like a directive to "speak in-character" to the players, but for the MC; it's telling you how the game is best played. "Don't show the dungeon map to the explorers" would be a similar directive; no one is being misled in any way, it's just the format of play, explained.<br/><br/>The core of the GM Mystery Cult, in my formulation of the term, is the deliberate misleading or obfuscation of <i>what actually happens at the table</i>. For instance, a GM who always contrives for the PCs to survive, except when it suits him, but claims, if asked, that death is constantly on the table and up to the dice.<br/><br/>I've never seen that kind of thing in "the indie scene" (I assume you mean "among people who play games designed in a fashion which is based on or heavily influenced by the Forge tradition), at least not as a trend.

I'm not even sure what the parallel would be with "make your move but don't speak its name".  It's just not equivalent.  What would a AW game be like if the MC said stuff like "Now I'm going to 'buy out someone's allies'"?  The AW MC is not being opaque here any more than a player who doesn't use the exact names of his feats when announcing his attack is being 'opaque' and they are certainly not actively obfuscating what is going on the way a GM who lies about how death happens is.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/manixur" rel="nofollow">manixur</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>By "indie scene," I meant "indie games, and the people who happen to play them."

This is probably why Paul was asking you to clarify.  GM practice is Lamentations of the Flame Princess is not the same GM Practice in Chuubo's is not the same as GM practice in Apocalypse World.  All are "indie" games.  All not only suggest but encourage different practices.<br/><br/>(There's also the fact that using your definition basically leaves you with "D&amp;D and maybe the Fantasy Flight Games" in the 'non-indie' category unless you use a very loose definition of "Big publisher"\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/manixur" rel="nofollow">manixur</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>So, what I mean is that I've seen opaque GMing both encouraged in indie RPG game texts and practiced by people playing those games.</p></div></blockquote>\nWhile I don't want to doubt you, right now based on your singular example, I'm not sure we agree on the definition of "opaque GMing" -- maybe you have some other examples to share?

Paul used the term "GM mystery cult", which is old, old theory jargon (I think from the Forge originally, or maybe I just encountered it there first). It's original meaning doesn't refer to anything that anybody does at the game table, but rather it's a description of the social attitudes and ideas that people attach to being a GM - it is essentially a snide name for the idea that being the GM is somehow special and elevated above the ordinary peons, the players.<br/><br/>It's a "mystery" cult specifically because the traditional gaming culture does not encourage player understanding of game rules and GMing processes. You're not expected to become a GM by playing, for example, so it's not even a case of learning by doing; rather, you have to be initiated, or self-initiate, into the "mysteries". Those mysteries might include stuff like planning plots and fudging dice, yes, but that's not the core observation captured by the "mystery cult" as a term. The core is that GMing is treated as a priesthood with asymmetrical lore that the other players do not partake in. That's how GMing is a mystery cult (in certain types of gaming culture).<br/><br/>As you can see, all that doesn't technically speaking relate at all to the techniques actually used to play - it's just commentary on how players are infantilized by a culture that expects only the GM to know the rules and use the rules and care about the rules (or not care, as the case may be). It's a matter of social power relations first of all, not of this or that technique of play. If Apocalypse World encourages Mystery Cult culture, then it does that by elevating the GM as a special caste above the other players, and not by telling this or that player to talk in certain way or keep certain things secret from the other players.<br/><br/>So that's what I understood Paul to be talking about when he complains about the Critical Role GMing advice - that it smacks of mystery cultism. I don't know if that's what it is (still haven't watched this stuff), but it wouldn't surprise me, as mystery cultism is really common in the D&amp;D culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472224/#Comment_472224" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T23:09:19+00:00" title="April 17, 2018 11:09PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought I had coined the term "GM Mystery Cult" (at least in my own use), and a Google search confirms that's likely (it seems to show mainly in my posts on Story Games).<br/><br/>However, I'm sure I'm not the first person to have used a term to refer to the idea that Eero outlines very nicely here, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if a very similar term wasn't in use years earlier (for instance, at the Forge).<br/><br/>I agree with Eero's description here, fully, if that helps.<br/><br/>Here's a quote from an earlier discussion we had about this, for example, for illustration:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/walkerp" rel="nofollow">walkerp</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Really?

And then I have to ask. Why is this a fear? I know that Matt and his players are doing this in front of a camera--I get why this might be a fear for them specifically, but I mean in the general sense, for the other GMs out there. Why is this a fear at all?<br/><br/>I know... different play styles, traditions, and all.  We've talked about this here at Story Games often (and probably will continue), but this fear... Maybe it's just the old wargamer in me, but this fear, it just doesn't track with me. I don't get it. Why is opening a book to check a rule, or find a random table, OR having to reacting in some other way to something the players `unexpectedly' do cause for fear?  It's a game we're talking about, not a stage play, right?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472949/#Comment_472949" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T00:39:28+00:00" title="April 27, 2018 12:39AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've obviously missed something important (and I'm not even being a little bit facetious about this).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472952/#Comment_472952" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T05:23:08+00:00" title="April 27, 2018  5:23AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Social pressure via myth of a norm ?

Mercer is running D&amp;D5, for heaven's sake, if in doubt, just call for an ability check and give advantage/disadvantage as appropriate.  If you can't manage to fake it when you don't know a rule in D&amp;D, you're a terrible GM who shouldn't be on camera (heh.)  I suspect that the fear under discussion is rather that of being unprepared to "keep the story good".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472960/#Comment_472960" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-27T14:44:35+00:00" title="April 27, 2018  2:44PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Matt wants to ensure that the story is amazing, so if the players take things "off the rails" he needs to eventually steer things back on course.

There's some evidence for that in this thread (like people complaining about Critical Role fans at the game clubs), but other than that it's just a hunch, based on the not-terribly-fun experiences a lot of people got out of that same advice 20-25 years ago. (The reason, of course, is that the methods aren't transparent; so long as some GM Mystery Cult attitudes remain, there end up being, consciously or not, elements of misdirection in the transmission of the process of play.)<br/><br/>It also suggests to me that the people involved aren't aware of the more modern understanding of roleplaying we have in the 21st century. I don't think it would be hard to question time-honoured assumptions as people have done, to give listeners and fans more tools and better tools. (For instance, it's not rocket science to explain that games do not need to feature the possibility of random character death by default; that alternatives exist. The idea that the game rules must always model the possibility of random lethal outcomes was an unexamined assumption in roleplaying for many long years, and I much prefer the modern understanding where we are allowed to question that assumption and thereby choose appropriately to suit the game we want to play at the table.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/adamwb">@adamwb</a>,<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing that. I haven't seen the whole discussion, but I listened to the bit you mention, with Koebel and Mercer. It ties in nicely with my point, above, I think: in this entertainment format, random character death is not desirable to audiences. Without managing that somehow in the rules, that creates a bit of a dilemma for people playing D&amp;D online. (Of course, perhaps they address it in more depth later? I didn't get too far.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473382/#Comment_473382" name="Item_191" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-05T13:36:30+00:00" title="May  5, 2018  1:36PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2018 1:36PM by Upstart.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really think filmed D&amp;D sessions with actors prove us much about players' enjoyment.

His motivations seem to be wanting to tell a good story, feeling that the players have entrusted him to do so, and fear of being caught off-guard.</p></div></blockquote>\nI believe what he means by "story" here is not pre-script but instead his word for "whatever happens in the game". A confusing and bad word for it, but once I got over that that's what he calls it, I can hear him a lot more charitably.<br/><br/>Listening to what you timestamped right there with that in mind and you'll see that he is on our side. He says to <i>not</i> fear being caught off guard. He says that whatever story the players create at the table is "so much more magical and memorable".<br/>That it's a back of forth tennis-like game of listening<br/><br/>Then Satine uses the word "story" to mean background-story, world-building and even story-scripting (another friend of hers talking about the hero myth). So they were talking past each other a little bit. And they go down an iffy rabbit hole of some sorta compromise between sandboxing and "guiding them towards a light".<br/><br/>Matt says if the players go somewhere unexpected, to go along with them "follow that thread and see where it takes you" by knowing your world and that that's where the real magic of the game is.<br/><br/>I have a vague memory of, and this might be wrong, Adam once saying that when they made Dungeon World they deliberately avoided the word "story". A wise call on their part I think.<br/><br/>I like these GMs a lot. Sure, they make some calls that I disagree with from time to time. (The "soft moves" from the assassin in Swan Song I had a hard time with, it removed a lot of the edge from that game.) But they aren't about preparing outcome. They do setup and then let the players take it from there.<br/><br/>I think some of Satine's guests are <i>super</i> wrong and I had to stop watching her version of DM tips. That doesn't mean that she herself is a bad DM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473407/#Comment_473407" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-06T08:13:11+00:00" title="May  6, 2018  8:13AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2018 8:13AM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think he actually says the opposite of your summary, Adam, in that clip you timestamped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473413/#Comment_473413" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-06T19:34:08+00:00" title="May  6, 2018  7:34PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh.

I really wanted to hear her talk about her own method of DMing.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why show then had this format of guests \u2013 some with advice that is applicable to my goal as DM, many with advice that are counterproductive.</p><p>This is also tied into our collective neurosis that the 90:s style of DM:ing is some sort of memetic poison that will compromise and ruin gaming if it seeps into the minds of too many watchers. And if we\u2019re ever going to have productive conversation I need to let go of that fear.</p><p>It\u2019s actually been frustrating \u2013 I\u2019ve been itching to play some 5e (After reading Xanathar\u2019s &amp; the PHB there are so many characters I want to make) under a DM using my own style but it\u2019s hard to find someone I trust enough to do that. I could maaybe find some B/X clone group. But also I\u2019m not the most popular player or best people person. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23emo2097&amp;Mode=like">#emo2097</a></p><p>Even within this idiom \u2013 almost every OSR DM does things that other DMs view as compromise and even taboo. It\u2019s just that everyone has selected their own compromises. (I know I\u2019ve sometimes felt the wish to be able to write some sorta \u201cDogme breach confession\u201d list. Most notably the way I timed the starting event of Deep Carbon Observatory within a larger sandbox \u2013 don\u2019t worry, this incident has also been something I\u2019ve discussed with my own group.)</p><p>And <strong>outside</strong> of that set of principles, once you bring in the whole \u201ccurate drama / arc / pacing\u201d mindset, well, then of course I\u2019m going to be dissatisfied. But I just don\u2019t have to watch.</p><p>I\u2019d say the root of all \u201csin\u201d of some of the 90:s style GM advice \u2013 in storyteller\u2019s guides, DMG:s, magazines, among friends and on shows like this \u2013 is less that they want to <em>teach</em>/<em>cause</em> people to introduce incoherence. They want to make people who <em>already do it</em> feel good about it.</p><p>Like, take the 5e DMG. Page after page on how to make a hexcrawl, how to roll up random NPCs, random inns, random dungeons, how to create location based adventures etc etc. And still there\u2019s that paragraph allowing fudging on page 235 \u2013 sepecially \u201cdon\u2019t let on that you\u2019re doing it\u201d. My own experience is that my game became better once I stopped fudging and of course it\u2019s frustrating to see the contrary position taken.</p><p>It\u2019s just the oft lamented truth that 5e is \u201call things to all people\u201d. I saw a player on some other site \u2013 maybe EN World? \u2013 complain that it was so hard to find a group that wanted to play the way that player wanted to (and their wish was opposite of mine which made it extra interesting, that people who want to play in <em>that</em> style also feel that frustration). This old <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2012/01/11/the-way-forward" rel="nofollow">Penny Arcade strip, \u201cThe Way Forward\u201d</a> <small>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbqr8YQL-9k" rel="nofollow">Fourth Panel here \u2013 NSFW/TW/CW, the Penny Arcade guys)</a></small> becomes funny in hindsight because they did it. They pulled it off. It\u2019s true that 5e makes it hard to find a group that by \u201cD&amp;D\u201d means the same things you mean. But it\u2019s also true that 5e makes it easy to find game material \u2013 modules, monsters, mechanics \u2013 that work. We just have to be more judicious about the play culture part of things.</p><p>It\u2019s also the case that\u2026 you\u2019re never <em>really</em> happy with someone else\u2019s style. I\u2019m watching Adam\u2019s (Koebel, not Dray) run of Tomb of Annihilation and I\u2019m still on the early episodes (I think I\u2019m on episode 6 now) and <em>tiny</em> things like \u201coh, he\u2019s not using the fishing rule from the DMG, they\u2019re catching way less fish than he would if he were using that rule\u201d and \u201cwhere are they getting water, do they have enough rain catchers?\u201d are popping up in my mind all the time. I mean in the end, I need to realize that</p><ol><li>those rules are modular/optional</li><li>he <em>is</em> using rules, he\u2019s just using other rules \u2013 and he\u2019s been clear enough to the players what rules are in play</li><li>his group has problems finding enough food, mine hasn\u2019t. his group has an easy time with water, mine hasn\u2019t. but the pressure is similar</li></ol><p>Similarly someone could look at <em>my</em> game and say \u201cwtf why aren\u2019t you using weapon speed factors?\u201d or \u201cwhy did you adapt the simplified travel pace rules from ToA?\u201d</p><p>As I told a player \u201cYou might wonder why I am the DM since I\u2019m such a bad DM\u201d and he was like immediately \u201cYes! I\u2019ve wondered that a lot!\u201d and I answered \u201cWhile I\u2019m not the best DM in the group I\u2019m the person who is most picky about DM:ing, who is the hardest to please about DM:ing\u201d.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s true for many DM:s? And that\u2019s why DM advice upsets us.\u2665</p><p>That\u2019s not Satine\u2019s or even the production company\u2019s fault.</p><p>It feels like we\u2019re blaming them for the 90:s happening.</p><p>D&amp;D is more popular than ever? Or at least it\u2019s very popular. And there are many new players. And I read the other day but couldn\u2019t find a source that 40% of players are women now! And there is D&amp;D on TV now, more than anyone has time to watch. And that\u2019s amazing!</p><p>Whatever is going on seems to be working!</p><p>And it\u2019s even a downhill battle for us who want it \u201cdone right\u201d. I believe the problem with the 90:s style for me was lack of information. Sandbox without the OSR-tools seemed completely overwhelming, impro without the SG tools was dissatisfying, railroading without participationism was frustrating. Now these tools are widely available. We can reach&amp;teach people how to run LMoP or Keep on the Borderlands (which was just rereleased for 5e) in an awesome way. Hell, just link someone to Clint\u2019s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6d5NvbMvT4" rel="nofollow">Damn Good D&amp;D</a>, give them the 5e Starter Set and let them go to town!

This is a good reminder to be conscious of what we say and how we say and to always strive to be better.<br/><br/>It's also nice to hear that this opinion isn't shared by everyone, as well. I just reread all of my own contributions to this thread on its first page, and it seems to me that I speak very positively of Critical Role, pointing out its many strengths and virtues, and chiefly ask questions, to poll people's opinions. I apologize if that's not how it came across.<br/><br/>For me, discovering this whole phenomenon was such a surprise and such a shock - I'm still mulling it over and considering its various components, so to speak.

I regret the harshness of my youth as well, I did not need to be so judgemental about many things as I have been (long ago for the most part, not referring to any SG drama here) - and I try to be kinder where I can.<br/><br/>That being said, the sense I've personally gotten from this thread has been that Paul is very interested in the topic, and finds it provocative, but he's not really committed to <i>attacking</i> Critical Role in any sort of foaming-at-the-mouth-forgetting-all-decorum sense. I can understand that swelling need to complain and criticize, I get rather agitated about some rpg culture things myself. I don't think it's wrong or mean, though, as long as it's clear that it's about Paul's feelings more than some sort of culture war crusade to purge wrongheaded roleplaying.<br/><br/>Should we start our own counter-programming, by the way?

Of course D&amp;D will be what is streamed and non-D&amp;D will be increasingly squeezed out. D&amp;D commands more eyeballs. Eyeballs mean money. Maybe some nice person will build an audience doing a non-D&amp;D game. And maybe it will last several months! Ha ha, you will think, that JDCorley, proved wrong again! But one day that person will wake up and think "This is nice.......but money is nice too." And there will be another D&amp;D stream. Of course professional actors on professional sets will succeed over amateurs, and the eyeball logic of social media engagement will make that gap grow exponentially. We know this will happen because it's happened in every other broadcast medium. <br/><br/>And of course, of course, of course mediocrity will prevail, because people turn away from genius and talent, turn away from challenging material and towards the familiar and the reproduction of our worst selves. Tasteless mush and bigoted mania will inevitably dominate streaming whether anyone gets railroaded or not. Look to video games for our future. Like, really look and think about who gets paid when PewDiePie screams a racial slur, or doesn't, and why.<br/><br/>The money is going to pay streaming RPGs to be a certain way. What you think about them doesn't matter. Only the money matters. Streaming RPGs will be the way Google and Twitch want them to be, not the way you or even the participants want them to be. Even if we resist for a little while, eventually, the money will win, as it always does.

In 1900, every small town in America had a municipal professional baseball team, every company in America of any size had a company baseball team, every town in America larger than "very small" had numerous semiprofessional baseball teams, there were traveling barnstorming teams and "pepper" teams (similar to how the Harlem Globetrotters would later "play" basketball). And by 1940, they were all -  all of them -  gone, because given the choice between watching enthusiastic and perhaps even somewhat talented amateurs play a game, playing themselves, or listening to a broadcast of professionals playing a game, overwhelmingly, people chose the broadcast and the pros.<br/><br/>It doesn't mean people don't still play baseball. But radio detonated inside American sports like a bomb going off, a roaring firestorm of commercially-backed destruction that has never stopped burning.   ESPN (especially pre-Deadspin) is a symptom of the fall - but you're decades too late. We're looking at the skeleton on the rocks at the bottom of the cliff, just scattered bones now, and you're looking around for suspects who might have just decided to flee. They're long gone by now, and their kids are very, very rich.<br/><br/>It's very possible I'm wrong. I laughed at people who were soberly concerned that Vampire would destroy RPGs. I laughed at people who were soberly concerned that computer RPGs would destroy tabletop RPGs. I laughed at people who were soberly concerned that video game console RPGs would destroy tabletop RPGs.  I laughed at people who were soberly concerned that Magic: the Gathering, the d20 boom, the d20 bust, and story games were going to destroy tabletop RPGs. Now here I am with my own sober concern and a fear that perhaps the universe is just and as a result my comeuppance is finally here for all those times I was so unkind to all those people who believed those dumb things about tabletop RPGs. If that is the case I suppose I will try to take my lumps with as much grace as I dished them out with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478155/#Comment_478155" name="Item_244" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-26T20:28:17+00:00" title="November 26, 2018  8:28PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2018 8:46PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" rel="nofollow">JDCorley</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Of course professional actors on professional sets will succeed over amateurs<br/>. . . <br/>of course mediocrity will prevail, because people turn away from genius and talent, turn away from challenging material and towards the familiar<br/>. . . <br/>The money is going to pay streaming RPGs to be a certain way.</p></div></blockquote>I think this is extremely plausible as an overall description of RPGs as entertainment.<br/><br/>At the same time, might not the overall growth of that market still leave more room for niche stuff than was possible before said growth?<br/><br/>I guess it depends on which is greater, the audience-expanding or the audience-monopolizing.

The content is just the carpet on the floor. I mean, it's probably nice, but it's not why we came to the art gallery. It's <i>the commercials</i> that are going to get us. It's not a nice looking actor pretending to GM a game for other nice looking actors that's the problem. It's the "YouTube" at the top, the Patreon a click away, the vlog "update four times a day!" pressures, the unquenchable, unstoppable hunger of the audience. <br/><br/>There's a reason Youtube is best thought of as an anime girl screaming that Hitler did nothing wrong before a commercial for a $80,000 car.   That's "content".  "Content" is a word that should give you pause just on its own.  Is that what we are in this hobby? Do we create "content"? For who? And how is it to be distributed? To whose benefit?  God grant that we are not "content creators". God certainly grant us that we are not "consumers of content".  There's plenty of really excellent pipefuls of coal slurry I'd rather consume than "content". <br/><br/>When given a choice between participating in an amateur experience and passively observing a professional one, overwhelmingly, people flee the amateur experience, and these days more money is pushing them to do so than at any point in human history. This is an industry that needs your players <i>and you</i> to stop attending, stop participating, stop collaborating, stop creating, and instead to click on their mouse buttons and tap on their screens more often and more frantically than ever before in history. I may be wrong, of course, (but I'm not.)<br/><br/>By the end of Trump's third term, you will have to pay to NOT stream your game, is what I'm saying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings" title="rhysmakesthings"><img alt="rhysmakesthings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings">rhysmakesthings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478263/#Comment_478263" name="Item_248" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-29T00:40:19+00:00" title="November 29, 2018 12:40AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2018 12:50AM by rhysmakesthings.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just like noone plays videogames anymore? (Fortnite has one of the largest, if not the largest, playerbases ever for online video games). Or no one plays chess now that there are professionals in the world of chess (how long have professional chess games been published for now?), and a tournament that's just been won with $2,000,000 prize pool thanks to all manner of advertisers (2,934,446 games of chess played /today/ on chess.com).<br/><br/>RPGs are small. Streaming is making them bigger. I think that perhaps the signal to noise ratio might change if the signal you're looking for is ~the current and most holy state of RPGs~, but the signal will still be there. Even youtube, which yes incentivises an unhealthy upload rate that means quick turnaround stuff floats to the top, has some really high quality stuff on it so long as you know where to look.<br/><br/>No doubt many people will play RPG's differently and there will be new RPG's influenced by the new ways of playing and watching. But the end is far from nigh in my opinion. The original signal will still be there, maybe even stronger, under all the stuff you deem noise. I've encountered far more people interested in playing RPG's in unexpected places in the past few years since streaming became popular, and I expect that to continue.<br/><br/>I think it comes down to the amount of work involved in creating a similar experience yourself. When I watch a really good movie, I still think it would be cool to make a movie, but that's really really hard so I'm just going to look for more good movies. Same with baseball tournaments or ochestras, those are difficult and expensive things to set up. When I watch (and enjoy) someone play video games, chess, or dungeons and dragons, I find these often precipitate me playing myself, since I know there are some relatively simple steps I can take to do so. Sure maybe some people don't get that feeling, but if some reasonable percentage of the growing audience does, then RPG playing will continue. And if a majority of people prefer to just tune in rather than participate I don't think that's going to negatively impact the number of people who do want to play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478281/#Comment_478281" name="Item_249" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-29T16:33:09+00:00" title="November 29, 2018  4:33PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I see where Mr. Corley is going with this, I don't think it's correct in this case.

For example, if you look at video games, streaming hasn't changed them that much.

And it seems pretty likely to me that there is money involved in the streaming content I'm seeing (for instance, Adam Koebel doesn't seem like the sort of gamer to me who would be running the latest 5th Edition WotC modules exactly by the book as his preferred form of spending his time. I could be wrong, but... it's a pretty strong hunch.<br/><br/>Meanwhile:<br/><br/>I'm still curious if anyone reading this has followed <i>Critical Role</i> enough to talk about how it has changed over time, especially from the first campaign into the second? Are any of these changes significant for gaming and D&amp;D overall, or streaming gaming, more specifically? <br/><br/>How does that relate to the business of the whole thing, and how that may change what we do going forward?<br/><br/>The game itself doesn't seem to be particularly heavy-handed about selling things, but even in the relatively early sessions I've seen, there's a lot of plugging content, events, fundraisers, and selling merchandise (easily 10-15 minutes, at least, per episode).

I have for the last several months listened to the Critical Roles podcast during the commute.  I have watched some of the videos but the majority of my "viewing" has actually been listening.  Much of the time I miss seeing the cool terrain that they build for the battles or their facial expressions when they are role-playing. I know these things are there but I don't see a lot of them.  <br/><br/>My own experience with RPGs is quite varied.  I started 30 years ago with AD&amp;D and played a lot of stuff over the years.  I like many of the more story oriented games. Capes is a favorite. The Shadow of Yesterday is very nice.  Dogs in the Vineyard is great.  However, in recent years I've sort of come back to my roots and run mostly OSR type stuff. My current long term game uses Castles and Crusades and I quite like the system.<br/><br/>I say all that to say that while I like Critical Role quite a bit (500+ hours is a lot of time), it probably wouldn't be my cup of tea to play in long term.  I listen to the show for the entertainment value but I also listen with a GM's ear that is a bit more critical.  So, for any fanboys or girls of the show who read the critical stuff, remember, I LIKE the show.  It just has some flaws. Everything does.<br/><br/>I'll list my thoughts in very short points.  There's a lot of them and this post would be horrendously long if I went into detail.  If you want to discuss any of them more, just let me know.  I'm happy to unpack some of them.<br/><br/>Things the show does well...<br/><br/>Obviously the quality of the acting and characterization is quite good.  These guys are professionals.  This might have grown from their private game but they didn't just put aside all that training when playing for fun.  It's like watching a pick up game of flag football by NFL players.  They are still skilled.<br/><br/>Production values started okay but have grown to be seriously good.  The show must be making some money and they've used it to improve and grow the show.<br/><br/>These guys understand character arcs and growth.  The ones that I think are the most noticeable and I enjoyed seeing where Vax and Scanlan.  The characters started the game with some serious issues and over the course of 115 episodes they grew and changed as characters.  They might have still been imperfect at the end but they had resolved their core character conflicts.  It was good storytelling.<br/><br/>Matt does a great job at preparing individual story arcs for each of the characters.  Interspersed with the overall story of their group he injects arcs from each character's background and ties it to the big picture.  He's good at this.<br/><br/>On a more micro scale, the players are excellent about sharing and passing around spotlight time.  They genuinely like to watch each other take center stage.  Everyone is engaged even when they aren't the center of attention.<br/><br/>The players know how to deal with failure.  While they are always trying to succeed, I think they have just as much fun when the dice come up crap as they do with critical success.  They enjoy it when failure from the dice gets their characters in trouble.  This is something a lot of role-players could learn.<br/><br/>Things that are problematic (at least for me)...<br/><br/>Some of the humor is a bit juvenile.  Brothel scenes and lightning bolts from the crotch are quick examples.  This is toned down as the game goes on but doesn't ever completely go away.  I'm 47 years old and not a teenager.  This doesn't appeal to me at all.<br/><br/>The setting is a style of fantasy I don't care for.  It's gone the way of all the later versions of D&amp;D.  Everything is gonzo but nothing is fantastic or otherworldly.  I find the setting very meh.<br/><br/>This next one is a nitpick. I admit it but it bugs me.  Matt is horrible are scale and measurements.  If you actually think about the measurements he gives cities and other large objects, they make no sense.  While this doesn't bother a lot of people, it would really get in the way of me being able to stay in the imagined space.<br/><br/>I absolutely hate how every little action requires a die roll.  Example, on the way to work this morning I was listening and one of the characters while looking around a shop had to make an Investigation check just to see what was on the shelves.  Really?  Why not just tell the players what's on the shelves?  This is a shop.  Presumably the shop owner isn't hiding things on the shelves.  They want to sell stuff, after all.  This happens a lot in the game and creates really stupid situations.<br/><br/>Several of the players are as terrible at the game part of the show as they are great at the acting part.  After 100+ sessions how can anyone still not know how to use their most basic powers without screwing it up?  My 7 year old can do this.<br/><br/>There's other things but this is getting long.  I'll leave the other stuff to future discussion if it comes up.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478719/#Comment_478719" name="Item_262" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T19:59:43+00:00" title="December  7, 2018  7:59PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2018 8:05PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gaerik,<br/><br/>I agree with all those observations. I think my favourite part of the show/game is seeing the fictional content Matt comes up with (often very evocative, colourful, and dramatic, despite the somewhat lackluster "kitchen sink" D&amp;Disms the setting is based on - his material rises above that line consistently, which is impressive), the character arcs he and the players both play into so nicely, and the tremendous focus and attention the players bring: they're always "on" and they always share the spotlight and the energy all around.<br/><br/>I think that's a huge part of the reason the game is so watchable: whether it's because they all know they're on camera or not, they're very good at staying "in the game". (I always think of how many of the players will sometimes make even rules questions entertaining to watch by asking them "in character"!) <br/><br/>This is a game with high standards for performance: a player who delivered dialogue in the wrong accent or not in their "character voice" would be called out on it immediately. <br/><br/>But it's also a game where the players have such strong and sincere reactions to everything that happens: they are never jaded or bored - they boo and hiss and cheer at every turn, which makes watching or listening much more captivating as a listener.<br/><br/>They also clearly like each other and the game, and share the love all around, which makes them enjoyable to watch - the sheer enthusiasm is powerful.<br/><br/>I also agree with your nitpicks - I am also surprised how a hundred sessions into a weekly game players don't remember how critical hits work, for instance. And I've seen a brief side conversation with an NPC require 6-8 rolls, despite not being of any importance to the game.<br/><br/>I was really hoping, though, that you might have some observations about the long-term focus and development of play:<br/><br/>As someone who's watched the whole thing, or most of it, how do you see the game developing and changing?<br/><br/>Has the GM's - or the players' - approach to playing this thing changed over time? Is the second campaign different in style or mood, or technique?<br/><br/>Do you have any sense of whether the participants' prep is changing over time? (Goes for the players, too, whether it's backstory or characterization or character optimization or whatever else we might consider.)<br/><br/>Is the storyline more controlled or less controlled, as time goes on?<br/><br/>Are the encounters, NPCs, themes, etc, being used in the game developing and changing over time, or are they being celebrated over and over? (For an example of what I mean, are villains growing more nuanced, or, instead, increasing in their obviously evil, hateful natures?)<br/><br/>What lessons are being learned, if any?<br/><br/>And, do you see any of these things as being related to the commercial success of the show? If so, how?<br/><br/>Thank you for the insightful post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478779/#Comment_478779" name="Item_263" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-08T14:18:59+00:00" title="December  8, 2018  2:18PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see what you were looking for now.<br/><br/>Speaking to story control, I *think* the game is fairly bog standard Participationist.  Granted, very well done.  I haven't seen this change at all over the course of the game.  It seems to me that Matt runs the game kinda like driving a car in the dark of night with the headlights on.  He gives the players some choices about what to pursue and then based on where they want to go he preps an adventure that is pretty much Plot Point A to Plot Point Z in a kind of all points lead to Rome manner.  I don't think he knows the entire arc of the campaign but he plans extensively what he can see in the headlights immediately in front of him.  After the adventure the players get a freer choice in where to go from there and the cycle repeats.  That seems to be a constant in the show.  I qualified my statement above with "think" because I don't know how it would be viewed by Matt or the other players if someone pushed at jumping the rails of the storyline.  The players are very good at choosing a direction and then jumping onto the plot rails from there.  It would be really interesting to see one or more of the players decide to do something really unexpected and see how that develops.  I don't think it will happen though.<br/><br/>I have noticed in campaign 2 that most of the players are better at learning the abilities of their characters.  That has changed a bit, so player prep might be said to have gone up some.  They still struggle sometimes with new powers but that's not really uncommon in games in my experience.  I don't think I've heard anyone in campaign 2 ask how critical hits are calculated or whatnot.  Some of the players are better at this than others.  Sam is still the worst at it.<br/><br/>In terms of style and technique, campaign 2 is more of campaign 1.  The characters are starting as a bunch of weird, fairly amoral asshats.  They're selfish, broken, and kind of jerks.  They're entertaining as hell but they certainly aren't heroes in any real sense of the word.  As the campaign runs along they are dealing with their failings and morphing into something more heroic.  That's the way the 1st campaign ran and it seems to be the way campaign 2 is going as well.<br/><br/>One thing that has changed is that the characters got weirder.  Season 1 had 3 half-elves, 2 gnomes, 1 goliath, and 1 human.  Season 2 has 2 tieflings, 1 goblin, 1 half-orc, 1 aasimar, and 2 humans.  There's 1 more human in the 2nd season but I find tieflings and goblins to be stranger than half-elves and gnomes.  The characters in Season 2 really are a collection of misfit toys.<br/><br/>As weird as the characters sound though, it really makes no difference.  All the non-human characters are just humans with funny physical features and some special abilities.  That goes pretty much for all the NPC's as well.  This particular criticism isn't unique to Critical Role but given their acting ability I was kind of hoping that these players would be able to actually portray the non-humans as well... different.  Your character has DEMON blood in him or her.  It ought to mean something in terms of who and what you are and not just be ornamental.  Gnomes should be more than short humans.  You get the idea.<br/><br/>As good as Matt's characterizations are (and they are fantastic) he's not good at nuanced villains.  I think the closest he's come to a morally ambiguous antagonist was Ridley (I think that was her name), Percy's gunslinging counterpart from the Briarwood story arc.  She was pro-human and wanted to increase humanity's knowledge and power in order to free it from dependence on the gods and other races.  Not a completely terrible thing.  However, she was completely willing to kill anyone and anything that got in her way which knocked her right back down into the Evil Asshole category.  There wasn't any moral ambiguity about opposing her or hunting her down.  It'd be really interesting if there were some antagonists that weren't obviously evil asshats.  As a side point, there's a development in Season 2 that might result in a more nuanced villain but I don't know yet how that will turn out.  It might just turn out that the character turn either into a "good" guy that is on the party's side or they might turn into a "bad" guy eventually and become another evil asshat.  I'm waiting to see about this.<br/><br/>Frankly, I see the commercial success of the show to be about the acting acumen of the players (Matt included).  They are just entertaining to listen to and watch.  I've tried other actual play podcasts and some of them might have better story value and be deeper in terms of theme and setting but I can't get into them because the players just aren't as entertaining to watch.  In fact, while I'd probably rather play with some of these other groups long term, I can't really get into just watching them.<br/><br/>Does that hit some of the things you're interested in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478786/#Comment_478786" name="Item_264" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-08T21:17:05+00:00" title="December  8, 2018  9:17PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a perfect answer, and exactly the kind of thing I was curious to hear about from a committed listener.<br/><br/>Thank you!

For example, a very black and white villain works great for a group that is interested in clear and distinctive characterization and a fairly linear plot that you can prepare for in advance. For a game like D&amp;D, that seems like a great choice, and Mercer's villains are terrifying delightful to hate.<br/><br/>For people who are listening to the game, rather than watching, you're missing some other cues, as well. For instance, a lot of Mercer's descriptions are written and being read off a sheet (so, presumably prepared beforehand). <br/><br/>These occasionally include things like an enemy's death or other events that aren't, in theory, guaranteed.<br/><br/>I wonder if that means he's ridiculously well prepared for every eventuality, or If he's just been doing this long enough that pretty much knows how things are going to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478788/#Comment_478788" name="Item_266" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-09T02:50:53+00:00" title="December  9, 2018  2:50AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It really would be interesting to see Matt's notes and prep.  I have a feeling he preps quite a lot, especially since the game has become an income stream.  I think he trusts his players to pick up on the subtle hooks he throws out there though.  Given that they seem to have a social contract that pretty much guarantees they'll play along with those hooks it probably doesn't take a genius to have a good idea of what major events are going to happen.<br/><br/>***Spoiler***<br/><br/>At the end of the Chroma Conclave arc, the ancient green dragon, Raishan, nearly kills the party and escapes.  I've often wondered about this event.  The fight with Raishan appeared to only happen because Vax turned on her when Thordak died.  I've wondered if Matt was going to have Raishan pull the double cross and was okay with Vax pulling the trigger first or did he plan on having the party honor their deal with the dragon and planned on having her reappear later.  In this case he needed her to survive.  Would he have let her die if the party had rolled well enough to kill her?  I would love to have a bit of insight on that.  It'd answer some questions about how illusionist vs participationist the game is.<br/><br/>***End Spoiler***<br/><br/>I'm pretty certain Matt has paid minions who build the battle terrain now.  I mean, the other session he had 3 separate battle spaces pulled out.  I'd have a hard time doing that and prepping for a full game session every week.  I'm willing to bet he has an assistant or two that do some of the work for him.  I have no proof of this.

In the first campaign there were characters with greater in-depth backstories that Matt worked into the campaign.  I think Vax, Vex, and Keyleth fall into the category.  However, I know from an interview with Taliesin that he only had the very basic, minimal background when they started the campaign.  The whole Briarwood arc was a complete surprise to his player apparently.  Also, Travis showed up to the first session with only a race and a class prepared.  He hadn't even come up with a name for Grog at that point.  I think his backstory was more emergent than planned.<br/><br/>The second campaign seems far more in depth in terms of the characters and their histories.  This makes some sense.  All the players have experience now.  They know how the game works and what kinds of things are helpful in making interesting character arcs.<br/><br/>Procedurally, it seems like Matt takes the character histories (or whatever hints are given by the players) and plans a story arc around this.  Then he'll attach those arcs in some way to the overall campaign arc.  He's very good at working these things in.  He'll do a campaign arc like the Kraghammer story and then move to a character arc like the Briarwoods then he's back to a campaign arc like the Chroma Conclave (which is actually 4 separate arcs).  Then back to Keyleth's Aramente.  You get it.  It's like how running TV series work. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478850/#Comment_478850" name="Item_277" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-11T12:06:22+00:00" title="December 11, 2018 12:06PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Has a player ever reacted to an opportunity for this sort of character exploration and growth with resistance based on their own character vision, like, "No, my guy wouldn't engage with that at this time"?

I don't know what goes on off camera so I can't speak to that.  No one has ever balked at the table though.  In fact, I've not seen any player be anything other than completely enthusiastic about developments to their characters.<br/><br/>I think this is a trust thing.  I think the players trust that anything Matt does is going to be cool and make their characters awesome.  If you aren't afraid of the GM nerfing your character mechanically or thematically, then you're generally fine with jumping onto anything the GM comes up with.  If you trust that the GM is in fact going to help enhance your character, you'll even be enthusiastic with your support.  This trust is one of the main things that makes Critical Role work.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478851/#Comment_478851" name="Item_278" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-11T12:12:36+00:00" title="December 11, 2018 12:12PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One thing to consider about streamed games is that people tune in for the players as much as for the characters and the story.

I've listened to other podcasts with the same level of silly antics and found it impossibly annoying.  Something about this group of players makes the worst of it bearable and most of it amusing.  <br/><br/>I think part of it is that even when being silly they don't abandon the serious themes that surround the game and their characters.  It's like the difference between Sean of the Dead and Zombieland to me.  I hated the first movie but loved the second.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478853/#Comment_478853" name="Item_279" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-11T14:23:36+00:00" title="December 11, 2018  2:23PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed.<br/><br/>For me, a big part of it is that, no matter how silly things get, they always stay "in the game", and react to everything that is happening with very genuine emotion.

The characters are powerful but not optimized, I would say.  Some of the players are fairly good tacticians but tactics play a back seat to being cool and staying in character.  Some of the players are just terrible at tactics.<br/><br/>Matt let's the dice determine outcomes, even character death.  He's also played opponents intelligently enough that they've gone out of the way to kill characters that are unconscious.  This didn't mean as much in the 1st Season where the characters were high enough level to raise their dead companions.  It's happened once in Season 2 where a character died and is gone.  The player rolled up a new character and was worked back into the party.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers ***<br/><br/>Interestingly, one of the big story arcs from Season 1 came out of a character death and a rather random one at that.  Vex was checking out a sarcophagus after a big fight and a trap killed her outright.  During the ritual to bring her back Vax (her twin brother) made a deal with The Raven Queen to serve her if she'd relent to allow Vex to return.  Vax multi-classed to Paladin and one of the best examples of character development was watching Vax move from shiftless and unsatisfied rogue to a character with purpose and meaning. Of note, he's the one character that died in the last episode and returned to The Raven Queen's side.<br/><br/>It is neat that this came out of a rather random event.  Matt didn't predict what was going to happen here.  He and Liam (Vax's player) just rolled with it and turned it into a great story development.<br/><br/>*** End Spoilers ***<br/><br/>Thanks for the discussion, guys.  I've found that while Critters are nice folks and fun to follow, they haven't been terribly open to frank discussions about the game that include criticism.  I like the show and the game but I also want to be able to talk about it critically (not necessarily negative criticism) and it's nice to have a place where that can happen.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478863/#Comment_478863" name="Item_282" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-11T20:19:43+00:00" title="December 11, 2018  8:19PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2018 8:35PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh!

No effort = no frustration.<br/><br/>But I guess I was wrong.<br/><br/>Are they simply doing their best to whatever extent remains fun, not worrying about how it's all arbitrated, and then gamely rolling with whatever outcome arrives?

They'll use opportunities to do that if they come up but don't go out of their way to look for them. Standing up to evil as heroic figures takes precedence over trying to be smart about winning, I would say.<br/><br/>Some combination of trusting Mercer to make it fun no matter what and the pressures of being a good sport on camera seem to be a magic formula.<br/><br/>(Notably, one of the players left the show in the first campaign, and some of the viewers say that it's because he was starting to try too hard to win, create advantages for himself, optimize his character and his odds, and so on, instead of just accepting whatever was happening.

However, he does run Raise Dead a bit differently than the rules require.  The rules for the spell say that the character is returned to life if he/she is willing and at liberty to return.  It doesn't give any rolls that are required.  Mercer requires a roll at the end of the hour long ritual.  However, 3 people (generally party members) can take part in the ritual and add something to convince both the dead character and The Raven Queen to allow the character to come back.  It's actually quite a brilliant way to make the Raise Dead spell more than just a vending machine.  If you follow the show and are invested the ritual is actually quite poignant.  The party members provide mementos that represent their character's relationship to the dead and then say/do something to make their appeal.  I've stolen this from Critical Role and will be doing something similar in my games from here on out.<br/><br/>In the end, even after the roll is made the player of the character can decide not to come back.<br/><br/>In any event, Mercer didn't have to come up with anything.  During the ritual Vax traded his freedom in servitude to the Raven Queen for his sister's life.  Basically the player handed the DM a reasonable excuse to bring the character back and a wonderful plot hook.  This kind of thing happens a lot.  The players don't mind embroiling themselves into trouble or complication in order to make the game better.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478890/#Comment_478890" name="Item_286" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-12T16:37:47+00:00" title="December 12, 2018  4:37PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds really great!

For instance, asking an experienced player to "show how it's done" usually improves their performance simply because they now construe the other players as an audience that is paying attention to their behavior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478937/#Comment_478937" name="Item_292" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-13T22:06:25+00:00" title="December 13, 2018 10:06PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2018 10:06PM by hamnacb.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The opportunity doesn't always arise, but sometimes you can play a group against itself a bit regarding social censure: if the members of the group realize that they are effectively performing for each other, that can motivate the players to simply "be better" than they would otherwise be, simply because they become self-conscious and want to give off a good impression instead of being their horrible everyday selves.

As with all other folk art, although aesthetics are valued in the home campaign, they are not valued for their mainstream appeal or for their commercial success.  In a stream, you're performing not for yourself or for your fellow collaborators, but for the streaming audience. There's a tension to that which the regular "gang of pals around the table" doesn't re-create.<br/><br/>(And don't forget: what you're performing is the gathering of advertising data and your audience is the advertiser.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478944/#Comment_478944" name="Item_295" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-14T00:32:48+00:00" title="December 14, 2018 12:32AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2018 12:34AM by Hans_c-o.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, Jason - I was being a bit purposefully obtuse with my question, since the difference between performing for your friends and performing for an audience who will turn you off as soon as you get boring is obvious.

What a charming interview! I love it. Since looking it up I see a few people recommending it as THE starting point to introduce a non-gamer to D&amp;D. Nice! It reminds me a lot of the Mayim Bialik interview linked to earlier in this thread, as well.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, let's see what I can make of the most recent comments:<br/><br/>* D&amp;D is cool and popular now, and finally we can leave sucky not-fun roleplaying behind forever!<br/><br/>* Streaming D&amp;D is going to destroy our hobby and make us all thralls to the inexorable advance of the Capitalist Machine.<br/><br/>Hmmm...<br/><br/>(Though I do think there's some truth to both points of view. Watching online streaming play is probably helping people learn a lot better/faster than in previous decades; we can compare notes and look at techniques and note how the way our group does it isn't the only way it can be done. I'm going to do some of that in my next post!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479128/#Comment_479128" name="Item_310" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-18T23:42:53+00:00" title="December 18, 2018 11:42PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2018 11:46PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep thinking about how this game works, and how the various bits and pieces of D&amp;D's rules contribute (or fail to contribute) to the fun the players and the audience are both having.<br/><br/>For instance, when I watch this show, I love the story developments and the dramatic roleplaying scenes, as well as some of the sheer joy and laughter. But I get pretty well bored to death during the combat scenes. (And the sequence leading up to the clip I'm about to post was somewhere in the realm of 2-5 hours of nothing but combat... boring as hell, for a viewer. I wonder what it looks like to non-gamers, watching?)<br/><br/>Would this group and this show be better suited to a different formula for roleplaying? Different mechanics, different rules-light/rules-heavy design? Sometimes I think that something like a good PbtA game would suit them well, but then those games aren't usually *designed* with "exciting to watch" in mind. They have other drawbacks in this sense (e.g. a lot of out-of-character conversations, potentially, depending on the ruleset). I'll have to file that thought for later and come back to it.<br/><br/>But I know that *I* would enjoy watching <i>Critical Role</i> a lot more if the fight scenes weren't so long (an hour long on average, as we know from the stats posted earlier).<br/><br/>Earlier in this thread I mentioned that I'm excited by the phenomenon of streaming play, its popularity, and (in the case of Critical Role, anyway) the high quality of the play. However, I am also VERY disappointed by the lack of good advice, guidance, and help for people looking to recreate it.<br/><br/>I know that earlier in this thread, I complained about the content of the various "advice" videos, and (I think) many people took my complaints as attacks on <i>Critical Role</i> itself. However, what I was trying to get at was that I didn't see the actual kind of advice and techniques in those videos which could get a group to the same kind of play. I've seen far better advice and discussion elsewhere, and to me it's a shame if the kind of "DM Tips" videos I've watched are seen as the best available (and potentially being watched by thousands or even hundreds of thousands of gamers).<br/><br/>Now, thanks to the conversation over in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21890/perception" rel="nofollow">Perception thread</a>, I have a perfect example.<br/><br/>At the end of session 32, there is a tense moment as the party interacts with an old woman behind bars. There is some suspicion about her identity, and one of the players (Vex is the character) goes to the bars of jail cell to fiddle with the lock. The GM has the old lady come forward, as well, to "help" her, and then calls for a Perception roll.<br/><br/>Here it is - the link will start you in the right spot, and then you should watch for just over a minute:<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-B5sUXSaTHKc?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5sUXSaTHKc"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/B5sUXSaTHKc/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>As you can see, the Perception roll is successful, which leads to a big reveal (or, perhaps, rather, a mysterious detail which enables the big reveal in the following session). Mercer calls the end of the session, creating a dramatic cliffhanger and a perfect launching point for the next session. This is highly enjoyable to both the players and the audience, who start floating their favourite theories about what's going on. It's also very television-like.<br/><br/>Now, it's interesting because it's clear that Mercer has created the situation for this quite deliberately: placing this NPC there in the first place (if <a href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">@Gaerik</a> guesses right, he might have made the decision to do so at the end of the previous session, as the players have made no secret of their plans to infiltrate the castle via the underground entrance), then having her come forward to handle the lock (an entirely unnecessary and risky maneuver for her, if we think in-character for a minute), and finally calling for the Perception roll that leads to the reveal.<br/><br/>However, the roll obscures this somewhat, even as it signals a possible reveal and heightens tension.<br/><br/>What I would like to know is:<br/><br/>* What would have happened if the roll had failed?<br/><br/>Now THAT is the kind of thing I would love to hear Mercer make a video about. Creating this kind of thing reliably, and the techniques that go into it.<br/><br/>Have any of you watched enough of the show to take a guess as to what's really happening in this minute-long segment, and what techniques enable it?<br/><br/>(Cutting away halfway through a tense reveal is one he likes a lot, and it very effective. But creating this kind of thing in the first place, and doing so consistently, is less obvious.)<br/><br/>The best find would be a moment in play where something like this is intended to happen but the dice don't magically go the way the story wishes. Are there any obvious "missed reveal" moments due to player decisions and missed rolls, or does Mercer always deliver the delicious reveal, instead? What does it look like when there's some struggle in the process? I'd love to see an example of that.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479134/#Comment_479134" name="Item_311" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-19T01:10:19+00:00" title="December 19, 2018  1:10AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After reading a few old articles on clashes in our RPG culture I realized that these CR people are playing D&amp;D in a '<a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/theory/narrative/paradigms.html" rel="nofollow">collaborative storytelling</a>' way.

Why wouldn't she help if she has some knowledge about how to do it?<br/><br/>What I'm really surprised at in the above scenario is that Mercer didn't have the person who was trying to deceive the lady about trying to in fact pick the lock when she wasn't make a Deception or Sleight of Hand roll. If I were running this game, as soon as she said 'I want to motion like I'm picking the lock but not actually try," I would've called for one of those two rolls, with a failure being that the lady behind bars would be pissed at the party and not want anything to do with them (or something commensurate to her motivations, which again, not knowing the context, I know nothing about). Instead Mercer just lets her successfully deceive the lady with no roll needed.<br/><br/>ANYWAY, your point is well taken about the reaction to the Perception roll. "Make a Perception Check." <br/><br/>"Perception?!"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Oh shit!"<br/><br/>In this instance (as in many others, I presume), rolling Perception isn't primarily about a character accomplishing (i.e. noticing) something, but more about signaling to the players-as-audience (and the audience itself, naturally) that something dramatic is going on. If this were a TV show, we would have already had a scene with the lady behind bars that revealed and foreshadowed her motivation in the current scene. But since it's D&amp;D, we don't have cut-aways with only NPCs, so rolling Perception is a hint that Something Dramatic That The PCs Don't Know About Is Going On Behind The Scenes!<br/><br/>Fascinating. All the more so that I doubt Mercer or his players have thought about Perception in this regard; he's just using the tools available to him to get the effect he wants, RAW be damned.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Also: I've never watched this before and the fact that they have a stream of comments in the video as the game is happening makes me want to (!!!) stab (!) myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479202/#Comment_479202" name="Item_316" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-19T22:35:22+00:00" title="December 19, 2018 10:35PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2018 10:37PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans,<br/><br/>When it comes to the old lady's attempt to help with the lock, I still maintain that it was (in retrospect) a pretty transparent attempt to feed clues to the players. That's why Mercer doesn't ask for a Deception check, as well: there's nothing at stake here, and he's (probably) more interested in creating this cliffhanger moment, instead.<br/><br/>The context is that the "old lady" is magically disguised, and is actually a villain of sorts, who only has one hand. However, the disguise is purely visual: she looks like an old lady, but her physical form is still that of a one-handed woman.<br/><br/>If you were interested in maintaining your disguise (which she is), and (obviously) well aware that you only actually have one hand, why would you reach forward to do something entirely unhelpful, and use both hands to do it? (She knows full well that she doesn't have a second hand - that's not the kind of thing you forget, you know? - and yet reaches forward with both.) Either she is honestly trying to help (in which case she wouldn't bother to pretend to use the other, non-existent hand), or she's trying to play up the disguise (in which case she would want to keep the false hand as far as possible from potential detection).<br/><br/>If it was the other way around - someone with two hands, disguised as a one-handed person - it would be quite believable that reaching forward and revealing yourself could happen, by accident (you instinctively reach forward, forgetting for a moment about your disguise) but not in this case.<br/><br/>Of course, it works great, since we don't know any of this when we're seeing the scene unfold - it's only in retrospect that it's fishy, and a minor detail at best. In the heat of play it delivers perfectly. But I do think it's likely a "tell": Mercer was deliberately trying to create this cliffhanger moment here.<br/><br/>I still have no idea what he would have done on a failed roll, of course.<br/><br/>(On a sidenote, I'm not sure what you mean with your reference to the "RAW be damned". Is some rule being violated here?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479246/#Comment_479246" name="Item_317" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-21T13:54:20+00:00" title="December 21, 2018  1:54PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>:<br/><br/>Some musings on your post. Perhaps this would be more appropriate in the Perception thread, perhaps not. The roll of the Perception check in this scenario is not, I think, to discern a clue as to the identity of the character, but rather as a sort of obstacle that the characters must overcome to earn the knowledge. Without that obstacle, it wouldn't be "fair" to simply give the knowledge away, would it?<br/><br/>(Answer: it would because I don't know how anyone would miss the character having but one hand in the scenario, but Mercer is holding onto the veneer of what I believe the locals describe "sim play.")<br/><br/>I suspect that Mercer set the DC incredibly low to ensure that the roll would succeed. He wants the players to have this knowledge, but he is obligated, either by his sense of fair play or the rules, to demand a Perception check to grant this information. (When running 5e, outside of using Perception as save-by-proxy, I call for it very occasionally as a measure of acuity. How much information does the character gather and, more importantly, how <i>quickly</i>?)<br/><br/>To answer your question here:\n<blockquote>What I would like to know is:<br/><br/>* What would have happened if the roll had failed?</blockquote>\nThe information would have been revealed to the players (and audience) in some other manner. If the player missed the roll, the scene would have moved onward, only for some variation of the following to take place:<br/><br/>1. "You don't notice anything immediately..." but then the reveal happens anyway. The Perception check is there to see how quickly the character notices.<br/><br/>2. "The character turns away..." and he quickly calls for another Perception check from another player who might be in a position to see the non-existence of her hand. The Perception check <b>will</b> be passed before the end of the episode.<br/><br/>3. "Nothing seems amiss," and the scene continues with roleplay and cleverness until the opportunity for another "slip up" of the disguised character presents itself. Another Perception check is called for, perhaps from one or two participants, and the reveal happens.<br/><br/>The reveal must happen regardless. Although I have long had a sour opinion of Critical Role simply because of the playstyle, I refuse to harbor any sourness toward Mercer's ability to engage his players (and audience) and weave a story. It's not my preferred playstyle, but it's how most players want to play D&amp;D. It's a much rarer breed, in my admittedly limited experience, that wishes to author his or her own story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479257/#Comment_479257" name="Item_318" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-21T22:26:32+00:00" title="December 21, 2018 10:26PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2018 10:31PM by Hans_c-o.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>:<br/>The roll of the Perception check in this scenario</p></div></blockquote>\nI'd like to point out (with glee) that you've successfully constructed a sentence where the word "roll" can simultaneously mean itself while also taking on the meaning of the word "role" and in either case, the sentence makes sense and in fact means the same thing!<br/><br/>I think you just definitively solved the asinine old rollplay/roleplay debate in favor of BOTH!

Professional wrestlers are absolutely athletes and it is absolutely a tough, intense event. But they are putting on a show first and foremost in the same way that a circus performer is.<br/><br/>Sport wrestling, by contrast, is much less interesting to watch for anyone who doesn't know the sport. There is no performance for the audience, just the activity. Viewership of sport wrestling is typically people who have wrestled or have family in the sport.<br/><br/>I think that interest in professional wrestling doesn't necessarily increase participation in sport wrestling, but it doesn't take away from it either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479267/#Comment_479267" name="Item_321" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-22T14:58:20+00:00" title="December 22, 2018  2:58PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, televising Texas Hold 'Em definitely screwed with my ability to play Kitchen Table Poker, even while greatly increasing the number of poker enthusiasts overall in my social circles.<br/><br/><br/>I mean, it generated interest.

There is now at least one academic thesis written about the show. Skimming it didn't leave me with any particularly interesting takeaways, but it's fascinating to see that:<br/><br/>* The author has been following the show during most of the duration of her studies (or so it seems), and concludes the paper just before the final episode.<br/><br/>* Although I haven't seen the ending of the show, to be sure of this, it seems telling that the nature of the "final episode" was known before it even took place, much like the series finale of a TV show.<br/><br/>Here's a link to the PDF, and anyone is interested in reading it:<br/><br/><a href="https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/983446/1/Hope_MA_S2018.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/983446/1/Hope_MA_S2018.pdf</a><br/><br/><br/>2. Second, on the subject of Illusionism and GM techniques, an interesting encounter takes place in Episode 33 (part 2). The party is attacked by ghosts, who are capable of possessing player characters. They do so, turning three of the party members against the rest of the party, causing a PC vs. PC fight which is pretty brutal (and almost sees two character deaths).<br/><br/>According to Mercer himself (he confirmed this on Reddit), the encounter was designed or chosen with the presence of Pike (a cleric) in mind (the player was supposedly on her way to join the session; perhaps her surprise arrival would have been a very dramatic deus ex machina moment!). However, that player didn't make it to the session, which meant that the group had no real way to counter the ghosts' possession.<br/><br/>Mercer improvises two interesting effects which are quite fictionally compelling but do not have a legitimate basis in the rules. First, one of the characters (Vax) has been carrying a glowing symbol given to him by the cleric, and has a particular relationship to that character. Mercer narrates the symbol flaring up, has the player make a roll (a Religion check), and narrates how the cleric's voice speaks to him, freeing him from possession.<br/><br/>Second, the use of radiant damage in the fight, which shouldn't affect the ghosts possessing the PCs' bodies, is applied to them, allowing the party to eventually win the encounter. Nevertheless, it's a close one (and presumably could have been far worse, and very anticlimactic, if Mercer had not made these moves).<br/><br/>It's interesting; it's fairly clearly an Illusionist or Participationist technique, as far as I can tell, but is presented in a compelling way which fits the narrative and makes a lot of sense, story-wise (which is really well handled by Mercer).  Again, I find myself wondering what he would have done if the roll had been a miss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479276/#Comment_479276" name="Item_325" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-23T14:12:47+00:00" title="December 23, 2018  2:12PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't acknowledging Participationism/Illusionism the first step on the road to Hell...er, Road to Dirty-Hippy-ism?

Granted I have very little to base this on, as only one of my players across 2 campaigns is a Critical Role fan, but he does his best to play like the Critical Role players do because his interest in D&amp;D came from the show.<br/><br/>"Unfortunately none of the other players in either campaign has expressed any interest in the show (except one, but it took him over a year to go from episode 1 to 23, so I hardly count that), and as such they play nothing like the Critical Role players. I've considered canceling one of the campaigns because of it.<br/><br/>"That's the main reason I fully support people using this subreddit to find players for their games. Because if you want a game similar to Critical Role, that's how you have to do it, not /r/lfg. Unless you're lucky enough to know people who naturally play like that."<br/><br/>And:<br/><br/>"I sort of tried d&amp;d in high school and I was completely unimpressed and thought it had potential but didn't like the vibe, the way people were acting and thought the gamestyle was bad. I then saw Critical Role and saw...wait THAT'S an option? people can play like this? No i didn't think I would get a group of professional voice acors with lights etc. I just sought out more RP centered games online, and they were easy to find and I was happy.

I can understand why someone would dislike the typical high school D&amp;D experience but like Critical Role... but how are they now getting the Critical Role experience? Just enough exposure to Critical Role among the player base? I can't quite believe you can learn to play at anywhere near that level just by being a fan of the show.<br/><br/>The techniques I've seen Mercer talk about have been considered good DM advice for decades, I don't think just doing those comes anywhere close, I think the core of the Critical Role experience is how well it looks when it's those are done by professional, charismatic, good looking voice actors. Maybe I'm underestimating the power of showing over telling, but I don't see how you can pick that up from the show.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479319/#Comment_479319" name="Item_330" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-26T04:08:57+00:00" title="December 26, 2018  4:08AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2018 4:10AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't speak for a random stranger on the internet (and I would love to hear other people's' takes on this).

But I've seen some people play and come away with the impression that the game can only be suited to goofy, silly antics (or whatever other form their particular experience took).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479321/#Comment_479321" name="Item_331" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-26T10:49:22+00:00" title="December 26, 2018 10:49AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2018 10:49AM by hamnacb.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Reading people's commentary on Critical Role is also pretty fascinating.<br/><br/>Take a look at a couple of these comments:<br/><br/>"I sort of tried d&amp;d in high school and I was completely unimpressed and thought it had potential but didn't like the vibe, the way people were acting and thought the gamestyle was bad.

The game rules/system sure doesn't help: provide the players with a long list of carefully-balanced combat powers, and then wonder why they focus on that? Give the GM guidelines for balancing combat encounters and to give rewards for defeating bad guys, then wonder why the personal drama gets set aside?<br/><br/>But it's also that this style of artistic expression does require thought, effort, and work. I get the impression that D&amp;D players often expect that to do done for them, by the others: how likely do you think it is that the person saying "I love to RP but it's hard to find a group who is really into RP in the same way I am" is the one who is contributing the MOST in terms of drama, character depiction, and story development to the group's game?<br/><br/>Traditional gaming advice (as seen in those videos I've linked to earlier in the thread) lets these people down, I'm afraid. The GMs are given advice on how to structure a story and how to world-build, and then how to identify the "type" of every player and "provide" the type of fun each of those needs - 25% fighting, 25% intrigue, 25% traps, and 25% talking, let's say; the players are given advice on the best feats to choose and how to optimize their character for combat.<br/><br/>That's at the root of my dissatisfaction with this kind of advice and this kind of attitude towards gaming, and why I'm not happy to see it glorified and repeated in this context.<br/><br/>I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way, however. This note earlier made me happy:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/shimrod" rel="nofollow">shimrod</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The techniques I've seen Mercer talk about have been considered good DM advice for decades, I don't think just doing those comes anywhere close [...] Maybe I'm underestimating the power of showing over telling, but I don't see how you can pick that up from the show.</p></div></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479367/#Comment_479367" name="Item_337" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-29T15:24:43+00:00" title="December 29, 2018  3:24PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a way, that approach is just realistic: it's unlikely to have a group of people all ready to study advice, pick apart their experiences for lessons, test new approaches... More likely, one (or several) will have that level of investment, and they'll be the DM (or DMs), and the rest will be more along for the ride, than willing to drive. So there's a lot more DM advice than player advice.<br/><br/>But it becomes a bit of a vicious circle, where the expectation is set that the DM is the one (helped along by all this DM advice, and discussions with other DMs) to orchestrate this masterpiece game for and around the players. This then places quite a substantial burden on the DM, and is a reason why noticeably fewer people are willing to DM than to play.<br/><br/>There's an ongoing discussion in my long-standing group that's somewhat illustrative of what you're saying, I think: we're finishing up a long-running high-level game, and inevitably, there has been "not enough roleplaying", and the proposed solution so far is a list of overpowered spells to be banned from the next game. There is something to be said for removing elements which tend to short-circuit interesting situations in non-interesting ways, but we're not really examining our approach or our shared goals or which ones might not be shared, I expect that just means a different set of spells are now left at the top of the heap, and any undesirable behaviour remains the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479370/#Comment_479370" name="Item_338" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-29T18:26:49+00:00" title="December 29, 2018  6:26PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well spotted, the vicious circle effect.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479373/#Comment_479373" name="Item_339" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-29T19:53:28+00:00" title="December 29, 2018  7:53PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479378/#Comment_479378" name="Item_340" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-30T12:07:44+00:00" title="December 30, 2018 12:07PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy shit, we truly are in bizarro-world now.

A few years ago another group of friends also got quite pushy about streaming our sessions, with big ideas about fame. What's weird is that this motivation seems to work for some people: the first group started working on a logo, sound and video equipment, gathering players, picking a game.<br/>In my mindset, you first get back into gaming and then if everything works out smooth, start thinking big, but in their case it got them working and excited, which is good.<br/>Have you found other groups with similar proyects?

Maybe you'll get a small payday down the line, if you write a popular game of your own or your stream takes off.  But I think it's usually not about that.  Lower-viewership streams (not Critical Role) create a rpg streaming scene that people can join and feel a part of something bigger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479384/#Comment_479384" name="Item_345" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-30T17:00:56+00:00" title="December 30, 2018  5:00PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RPG takes a lot of time (no luck this solstice, it was all card games and guess what I draw).

I realize now that I've usually left this up to the game and the group, though, without making a concerted effort to do it when otherwise those things don't seem to come together - for example, I absolutely didn't communicate this in my latest 5e campaign - I had assumed that the nature of the starting situation (political, fairly serious, in a specific setting chosen to encourage investment in the players), would create this feeling of the campaign as a Serious Project. <br/><br/>It did not.<br/><br/>Whereas, for example, in playing Sorcerer and Burning Wheel, that investment has almost always been there without need for a specific discussion about it. Because most people who are going to play those games have read the texts, and the texts either specifically call this out as a goal (Sorcerer uses the band metaphor and even specifically says that if you invest in it, game night will very likely be better than watching your favorite TV show (!); Burning Wheel asks so much of the player that that investment is nearly a baked-in as a prerequisite to play).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479404/#Comment_479404" name="Item_349" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-02T01:15:30+00:00" title="January  2, 2019  1:15AM">January 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I've found that it's a good policy in player management to treat the RPG campaign as a Serious Project, as that generally causes an all-around improvement in how seriously the players treat the exercise.</p></div></blockquote>\nThis is a great point.  I've found a similar effect when traveling to game with a specific group or planning an all-day event.  The tone of the game changes when you frame it as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">project</span> you're committing to.  I imagine that starting a streaming show requires you to step up to that level.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">@Hans_c-o</a> I've had similar experiences with people who are committed to playing a specific system to the fullest.  I think it's both a result of folks investing in a game and having a clear, shared sense of how that system should feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480261/#Comment_480261" name="Item_350" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-09T19:02:51+00:00" title="February  9, 2019  7:02PM">February 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking about this thread recently when I stumbled across some pretty detailed and insightful commentary about the new campaign by a fellow named Mick Riley. He starts out with a very celebratory (perhaps almost fawning!) review of the first episode of the new campaign, breaking down in detail how Mercer constructs the opening session to perfection. (And I don't disagree with his observations, although I found the episode almost unwatcheable due to boredom - but it's true the Mercer does do a lot of things very well within the session.)<br/><br/>However, then I saw that he also did a "breakdown" video for the second session, and that was far more interesting, because the session was seen by many as a <i>failure</i>.<br/><br/>He seems well informed on Mercer's practices and techniques, and looks carefully at what elements of the game are prepared (for example, keeping careful track of which bits of description or dialogue are scripted). This is pretty interesting for the purposes of this thread, because he breaks down what he thinks Mercer's prep might be like and his various attempts to "keep the players on track". The analysis is thorough and seems very believable to me. It also fits well with our hypothesizing here in the thread, supporting the notion that Mercer (as he says in his own interviews and videos!) does NOT directly railroad the players, but he does prep content which outlines the adventure, and has to work to get the players "back on track" when they deviate from it. As we can see from this episode, however, Mick Riley argues, we can see what it looks like when it's not working well - in this case, a full episode of frustration, boredom, and fatigue, to the point where it overtakes the joy of play. (Riley suggests that if this happens at home, you should just call the session and pick it up another time, in fact.)<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube"

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The effect of Critical Role continues to be felt on the world of D&amp;D gaming. I did a lot bit of looking around online and was slightly (but not entirely) surprised to see a couple of interesting things:<br/><br/>First, a conversation on Reddit about "playing D&amp;D without so much violence". When some people recommended a variety of other games which they could play (although some of the examples were funny, just being games where violence is more dangerous, but still just as central), many people responded with some variation of, "What, there are other RPGs out there, other than D&amp;D? What's that like?"<br/><br/>Not entirely surprising, but it also feels like a bit of a throwback to the 1990's for me. Odd.<br/><br/>Second, there has been talk of something called "The Matt Mercer Effect" online now, starting (perhaps) here:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/a999sd/how_do_i_beat_the_matt_mercer_effect/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/a999sd/how_do_i_beat_the_matt_mercer_effect/</a><br/><br/>...and generating YouTube videos and articles (as well as incredibly gracious responses from Matt Mercer, which is so great to see). Apparently, D&amp;D players coming into the hobby from the show is common enough that it's now a recognized problem for people running or joining games. This goes from unrealistic standards to the rules Critical Role uses not perfectly matching the RAW to performance anxiety and players who seem to be "acting for the camera" instead of interacting with their friends, even when there's no camera. (And, in addition, some people don't realize that the point of roleplaying isn't necessarily to stream it online.) <br/><br/>There was one (to me) rather chilling comment from someone who runs a livestreamed game and watches the number of people viewing as they play, constantly looking at those numbers and getting really worried if they drop.<br/><br/>What a world we live in!<br/><br/>On the other hand, it sounds like Critical Role has really inspired some people to have "more roleplaying" in their D&amp;D games, and that can sometimes be a really positive influence.<br/><br/>Have any of you had any run-ins with the "Matt Mercer Effect"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481876/#Comment_481876" name="Item_352" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-11T19:17:24+00:00" title="April 11, 2019  7:17PM">April 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MatthewMercer's answer is classy as hell.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481877/#Comment_481877" name="Item_353" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-11T19:27:00+00:00" title="April 11, 2019  7:27PM">April 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What\u2019s perhaps even more impressive is that I\u2019ve looked up other conversations and videos, and he has found them and left equally classy answers there, too (on all the ones I\u2019ve seen!).

I like that a lot.<br/><br/>I haven't had to deal with the Matt Mercer Effect much.  Only one of the people at my table has watched the show and she's not naive enough to think our game is going to be like Critical Role.

If his game is <b>better</b> than your home game, he gets "Ugh, the Matthew Mercer effect is bad for D&amp;D, creates expectations we can't fulfill".<br/><br/>If his game is <b>not</b> as good as your home game, he gets "Oh, PbtA would suit his game better" or "Oh, he should do it more OSR style" or "Oh, why is their game so skillcheck heavy or combat heavy or w/e" or "Why does the party's cast of charactes look so alien compared to Elmore's picture in the 2e PHB" or w/e.<br/><br/><b>Leave Britney alone!</b><br/>Are you only gonna be happy when his game is an exact beat for beat copy of your own game?<br/><br/>One of my players is a fan and can like it for what it is. (And so do I; I've seen around 15 eps and had a lot of fun with them and the amazing cast and characters.) He doesn't have any expectation that Mercer has to live up to the same design philosophy that I do or use the same house rules that I do. The things that Critical Role <i>does</i> do well, this player tries to bring to our own table, which enriches it. The things that CR <i>doesn't</i> do as well as we do, well, he has generous oversight with them, appreciate them for what they are, and is just grateful &amp; happy that what we do in our own group works for us.<br/><br/>I could never record a video or podcast, I'd be way too nervous or want to edit out way too much of my gaffes and weird opinions. Matthew Mercer is an amazing on-camera talent in that regard, charismatic and a good host to this group.<br/><br/>He is also a reasonably well-read RPG nerd. Obviously he is familiar with PbtA since he is friends with S-G's own <a href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">@skinnyghost</a>. He also lets completely off-the-wall things happen. Unlike some other (really bad) DM advice out there, he doesn't cheat with dice or HP or stacking the Deck of Many Things. There is literally a show out there saying "here is how you use a trick box to make it look like a random draw but you have selected the card", and "if you have a d20 set to 20, and then roll another die, you can then lift your screen and show them the 20 and they'll think that you just rolled a 20". Mercer doesn't do funky bull shrimp like that. CR is a real game to them with real fighting, real spells, real abilities. Does he prepare encounters and serve them up? Yes, sometimes, but that's hardly an unusual or exceptional style outside of the OSR.<br/><br/>We wouldn't pick apart our friend's campaigns this way, like we wouldn't want to dissect Adam's City of Brass or Deliverator's AW&amp;W or w/e. It's like\u2026 <br/><br/><b>Mercer just plays normal D&amp;D.</b><br/><br/>It's just a lagom, normal game. Halfway between sandboxed and railroaded, halfway between improvised and prepared, heavy on the rules &amp; consequences for rules and abilities.<br/><br/>I run a much more extreme game when it comes to throwing all pacing, narration and story arcs out the window in favor of running a <i>world</i>. But Mercer isn't my polar opposite, which would be someone who is absolutely glued to story arcs and narration and railroading and illusion. Mercer is just a normal DM (coupled with an exceptional screen persona).<br/><br/>I really, really, really regretted slagging Wheaton and Titan's Grave a few years ago. I do like Wheaton, he seems like a cool guy. But compared to Wheaton's kinda railroady, very 90s-RPG style, Mercer is just\u2026 he just lets the characters do what they want to a greater extent. I don't turn to Mercer for someone to emulate since our table has a more extreme style. I'm much more inspired by someone like Koibu and his huge and open sandboxes. But have I got any major complaints with Mercer?

In fact that's kinda <i>more</i> to the point of what I don't want to pick on. Like, I said I regretted my criticism of Wheaton and TitansGrave. If he had been just some rando DM on a forum posting APs I could've been like\u2026 "Listen, it sounds like you have these and these and these issues. Here's some advice". What I forgot was that he wasn't. He was putting on a show &amp; putting himself out there in a way that I haven't.<br/><br/>I guess that's a dividing line here; people being <i>more</i> critical of them because "it's a show", or people being <i>less</i>?<br/><br/>I remember getting kinda pissed off at Chris Perkins for giving some advice that I at the time thought was iffy in the Robot Chicken Writer's Room one-shot he did because I saw that as an <i>advice</i> show. Whereas with his stuff for AcqInc or for DCA I'm like "OK, w/e, it's just a show".  <small>(Otoh I must've listened to that advice show 20 times so obv I found something in it that made me happy.)</small><br/>Same how I really really get bugged by bad advice from Matt Colville or Mick Ryley, people who I feel suffer from some fundamental misunderstanding about how to prep and run games \u2014 the same misunderstanding I myself was under for two decades! \u2014 and they've set themselves up to be like "hey new DMs look here and we will teach you" and I want to go like noooo... don't confuse others with your 90's style\u2026 <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> <br/><br/>But when I see a YouTube RPG "show" I don't really care that much if there's all kindsa fudging or handwaving or arc-writing or w/e, things that I would walk out if a DM did in a game where I played. I'm there b/c I click with the cast and characters.

Like you said, you would react differently if it were someone presenting an AP asking for advice, for example.<br/><br/>I sort of feel like it sounded like I was saying "it's okay to be negative because of reasons" and I regret it because it's not what I wanted to mean. If anything, I suspect we simply don't have particularly clear-cut frameworks for how to respond and interpret AP-as-entertainment. Is a GM an actor? A director? Should we treat the AP itself as candid/documentary-style? And how does that differ from the very intentional/semi-scripted aspects of the game itself that are its focus? And cetera and cetera...<br/><br/>I think it's relatively safe to say that Critical Role (just as an example) has an intention that is separate from the game that is being played in it...but the lines between the two can be extremely blurry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482254/#Comment_482254" name="Item_365" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T20:14:19+00:00" title="April 21, 2019  8:14PM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://twitter.com/matthewmercer/status/1120033252322840576" rel="nofollow">Here is Mercer's own take on this discussion</a>. \u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482271/#Comment_482271" name="Item_366" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T22:22:46+00:00" title="April 21, 2019 10:22PM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2019 4:33AM by Paul_T.">edited April 22</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that\u2019s really great.
