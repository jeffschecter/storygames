I'll be watching or reading something and it'll get my imagination going and I'll start writing up rules to emulate the genre. I hope to one day release a pdf and I have two systems that are close to completion but I want to make sure they're as good as they can be.  I was hoping that if people had time they could take a look over and give me some feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first is High Stakes. I'm passionate about comics and feel that there has yet to be a superhero game that truly captures the medium. To this end I've spent some time putting together my own rpg system called High Stakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that there are many superhero games out there but I'd thought I'd ask if you'd kindly look over my rough draft at the below link.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?myyxmmjxyzd<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I've tried to do is give the player the flexibility in the definition of their powers and abilities, giving them as many options as possible while keeping the system simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's based around the idea that heroes expend energy (either their powers, their luck, or other resources). When they fail at a task they become weaker but if they succeed they usually recover their strength, getting their second wind.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such the core mechanic is a cut down version of poker. When trying to succeed at a task the GM sets a target number (placing a card with correct face value face down). The players stake chips from their three hero pools (power, plot and resources) and if they stake equal or above the target number they pass the task.<br/>\nSo they can pass most checks but if they stake to much they'll get weaker faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn combat all parties pick a card, highest wins but they don't reveal this until everyone has staked at least 1 chip and someone calls. The winner gets an equal number of chips from their opponents ante as they staked so players can continue to stake in the hope of draining their opponents reserves and become stronger. Even if they have a losing card they can see if their opponent decides to 'fold' which means the opponent only loses half his ante.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there isn't a health system. Players just run out of resources. I think this better duplicates the ebb and flow of comic fights. The players can be as inventive as they like as they describe how they're using their various hero pools.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers are also rewarded with chips to replenish their pools by doing things typical of comics such as involving their supporting cast, patrolling and making revelations about their character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've run a few sessions to playtest it and its gone well. The system was able to handle a character who was a spirit that possessed inanimate objects, a speedster who used her media empire just as much as her powers and led them through an exciting high speed chase and final battle on pier as it collapsed into the sea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second game is Messengers. Inspired by programs like Medium, Millenium, Wonderfalls and even My Name is Earl I've developed a game where the players are chosen Messengers, receiving Messages from an enigmatic source.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Messengers have gifts such as postcognition, premenition, the ability to see ghosts and so on. Using these gifts they gather information about the Message to work out what needs to be done. Each piece of information leads them to another clue which gives them a plus modifier when they next use their gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game does not centre entirely around gathering information but rather what they do with it. Their gift might show them the identity of a killer but how do the Messengers make sure that person gets arrested? Similarly if they know a plane is fated to crash how can they stop it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMessengers allows a great variety of adventures given that the Message will motivate them to take interest in other people. It might require them to stop a couple breaking up, help someone achieve their goal in life or find a lost puppy. Each has just as much challenge as stopping a serial killer or preventing an accident.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a reward for carrying out the Messages the player characters receive karma which they can use to affect their dice rolls but also improve their characters lives or to increase their stats. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I'm aware there aren't to many games that cover this specific genre and I'm hoping it ignites peoples imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can download a rough first draft from the following link<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?9mwqm4zjmlc<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd appreciate any thoughts on these two.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180921/#Comment_180921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-30T19:24:48+00:00" title="November 30, 2008  7:24PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Both of these look interesting, thanks for posting them up. I've only read High Stakes over once, I'll probably try it out with some friends at some point. Here are my immediate issues:<br/><br/>1 - The name. It does not suggest "comic book game" to me at all. It's a good name, but it suggests to me a superspy game, or some genre that involves gambling.<br/><br/>2 - The base mechanic is wonky. I can see what you're trying to do with it but I don't think you get there. Let's say a character is trying to do something. They don't allocate enough chips to beat the difficulty number. They fail. They try again, they fail again. They are now <i>worse off for trying something</i> than they were when they hadn't tried anything.  This will encourage characters to <i>do nothing as long as possible</i>, in order to gauge the difficulty of tasks, then attempt to blow those tasks out. This is the exact opposite of what you desire.<br/><br/>What it appears you are after is a situation in which a character does something, does not quite succeed at the goal, escalates to trying more, then escalates to trying more, and eventually succeeds.  That can't work by spending out of a finite pool. I promise there will be no escalation.<br/><br/>Example: I have 30 points in a pool. I estimate the difficulty of a task at 9. It is in fact 13. I play 10 just to "be sure".  I fail.  Now in order to actually win I have to spend a total of 23 chips. That's more than twice what I originally thought the difficulty would be. The penalty for my mis-estimation is not the difference between my mis-estimation and the actual difficulty, or anything near it. The penalty is that I lose everything I risked. This is going to make me very very risk averse.<br/><br/>I can see where you're trying to go, and I agree - the vast majority of comic book conflicts escalate, they don't spiral downwards into flailing with the last ounce of strength, the last punch is the biggest.....I just think you need another route to get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/highstakes" title="highstakes"><img alt="highstakes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/highstakes">highstakes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181041/#Comment_181041" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T12:05:59+00:00" title="December  1, 2008 12:05PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your thoughts. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there needs to be that element of risk when attempting to resolve a task. It allows the player to show the same bravery that their hero must display. I take your point that if they don't try then they don't lose chips but it also means that they'll fail through inaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think the players and the GM need to be on the same page with the difficulty so the player can make a good guess about how much to stake. Most difficulty ranges will be quite low for most tasks, normally between 1 to 5, and more difficult tasks 6 to 10.  This allows a player to make a good guess so they should never be more that 1 to 3 points out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the important things to consider is that a player character is not on his own, he is part of a super group. The game tries to emphasise teamwork by encouraging teams to work together, pooling the chips that are staked. Even if they don't do this other players in the group will learn which stakes are to low. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe finite number of chips also drives the other part of the game, encouraging players to add comic book drama into their characters lives. They can have scenes that involve their supporting cast, who are often ignored or treated as a disadvantage in most systems, and use them as a resource, replenishing their chips. They can pursue subplots or even make revelations about their character that adds detail and excitment to the game. They can go patrolling or even just receive chips from their fellow players, showing again the importance of being a team.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards to spiralling strength the number of chips don't necessarily represent the power of the action. Say a player character stakes his last few chips fighting a towering monster. With no more chips to stake he calls and reveals his card. If he wins that strike is strong enough to stun the monster and gives the player character a second wind as he gets all his chips he staked, plus the monsters pot. If he loses that strike is just as strong but the monster was stronger and the player character collapses. It doesn't matter how few chips were staked, if they have the higher card they still win the conflict and get the pot.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring play testing players at first tended to stake about 2 to 4 chips higher than the difficulty. They would deal with the inital threat and then each have a scene with one of their supporting cast giving us all a good insight into who their character was.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey then started to embrace the chance to pool their efforts. Faced with a burning building the speedster rushed people out of the building will the mentalist used telekinisis to tip over a water tower and put out the flames. By pooling their chips they manage to deal with the fire quickly. While interrogating the arsonist the team leader used his diplomacy skill while the super strong member used his strength to intimidate the arsonist by bending iron bars.By pooling their chips they scared the arsonist so much he confessed to everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181051/#Comment_181051" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T12:40:46+00:00" title="December  1, 2008 12:40PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just think that any game that punishes people for trying something is not a good action game.
