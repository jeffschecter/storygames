It can be pretty easy, depending on what you do, and it's generally more profitable (not that many people make real money at RPG publishing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177447/#Comment_177447" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T14:22:41+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  2:22PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ever since Pelgrane's thread about advice, I've had a rant building up about self-publishing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis post is not that rant; Rather, I just felt like saying that. I'll probably put it up later, or on my LJ. <br/>\n<br/>\nRon,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy assumption is that getting it published is your goal, and you're non-specific about how or who.. Which is to say, I'm not going to assume your intention is to find someone else to publish it for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf that IS your intention, you won't likely find a lot of support here. This community was born out of the indie roleplaying games community, and still shares a lot of the same values. It's quite possible that you've not even considered the possibility that you can publish a game all by yourself, without massive outlay of cash and resources. I know I hadn't, before I was pointed toward the Forge, years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nFact is, these days it's really easy to publish, even if by publish you mean hardcopy books sold in stores. I've not successfully, by MY OWN standards, published a product, but I do have two fairly swank looking copies of games I've designed sitting on my nightstand. Oh sure, they're not as swank as they could be, because I screwed up on some layout stuff, and I did all the art and layout myself.. But they're still pretty sweet. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm hardly the best person to give advice on this, as I'm one of the people who doesn't have a book out there making money yet.. But I've seen the process, and I've done a lot of it, and I'm still doing a lot of it, and have been for many years... So my perspective is unique, at any rate. <br/>\n<br/>\nReally though, to get the best advice, we need to know what your intentions are. Why do you want to publish? Do you want to make money? Do you really just want a hardcopy of your game that you didn't print at Kinkos? Do you have an insane drive to create, and you want to inflict.. I mean *share* that with others? Depending on your answers, and how much effort you are personally willing to put into your project, and how much money you are willing and able to invest, the advice will be very different. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, lay it on us!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177505/#Comment_177505" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T03:13:14+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  3:13AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2008 2:49PM by Simon_Rogers.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As well as self-publshing being the best option in many ways, existing publishers do not want to publish other peoples' games. We've got RPG writers coming out of ears. These hawk-like megapublishers waiting to swoop down and make buckets of money at the expense of poor, exploited writers simply don't exist. Mongoose does Flaming Cobra, but I suspect this is more to give them some indie cred than to make them a lot of money. I have discussed publishing other people's stuff, but usually all I can offer is more sales, not more money. I discussed this back in the day with Paul Czege. I'm sure I could have sold twice or three times as many copies of MLWM, but even if I'd given him every penny of margin, he would have made less money.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin, Ken, and most of my other writers do work for hire. They want to be able to produce the work, knowing exactly how much they will get paid for it, then move on without worrying about any other side of the publishing business. It's specifically what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames Semple (who produces music for us) approached me, and he is incredibly talented, bring something completely new to the table. We simply split royalties. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, Ian Thomson, who has produced excellent PDF Dying Earth supplements has worked on a royalty split. He wrote, partially arranged illustrations and laid out the adventures. He (and we) have made very little money from this. <br/>\n<br/>\nGraham Walmsley who is doing a character generator and excellent Purist Trail of Cthulhu advenutre for us - split royalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend any new publisher to go the self-publication route at least to start with, even though it entails lots of activities unrelated to developing games. Establish your IP. There are lots of channels to market in addition to selling stuff direct, and they increase your potential income. The one place you are unlikely to want to sell stuff in the short run is through retail - the margins aren't there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one exception to this. If your priority is to get your game into as many peoples' hands as possible, so they actually play your game, and you aren't bothered about maximizing your income, then going to a mainstream publisher willing to take a risk of a decent print run who has channels to market is still a good option. But good luck finding someone willing to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177514/#Comment_177514" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T05:38:25+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  5:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to echo Wolfe entirely about how easy it is to publish your own game now, once you have taken the big step of actually creating it.<br/><br/>I have published one game, and before I did it I was under the impression that being a games published was a really big deal financially. I'd heard that printing books cost thousands, that it selling it meant making deals with distributors, signing soul-eating contracts with retailers and the like. Likely as not all those things were true once upon a time, but they aren't now.<br/><br/>So the steps I went though to publish my game (because although there is loads of good advice out there I don't think a summary hurts)\n<ol>\n<li>I wrote it</li>\n<li>I played it with friends to test it</li>\n<li>I got some people who weren't my friends to play it / read it / tell me about it</li>\n<li>I did artwork for it (and also bought artwork from people, this was the first step that cost money)</li>\n<li>I got someone to lay it out for me (because he knew what he was doing)</li>\n<li>I took that layed out file and sent it to a US printer (Fidlar Doubleday) who printed 150 copies for me</li>\n<li>Those copies were sent partly to me and partly to Indie Press Revolution in the US</li>\n<li>I sold my copies at cons, IPR sold theirs online ... and there you go</li>\n</ol>\nThere are three bits in there that cost money (art, layout and printing). You can do the first for free (have no art, draw your own, use free art), and the second (lay it out yourself or have a friend do it not for money). The third usually costs a few hundred dollars, because printing is cheap now, but you can do that for free as well, either by releasing your game in PDF, or by using a print-on-demand service like Lulu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Black" title="Black"><img alt="Black" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Black">Black</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177830/#Comment_177830" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-09T03:27:25+00:00" title="November  9, 2008  3:27AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had actually thought of publishing the game ourselves, but thought that it would cost a vast amount of money, all the things mentioned above about layout play testing and the others have been done, its getting it into as many peoples hands as possible that is the problem once we did publish ourselves (if we did that is).
