We rounded up some friends and gave it a go.  But it's my friend's <i>very first time</i> GM'ing, and we ran into some rough patches, caused by my initial resistance to some GM-force.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to facilitate my friend's Dream Campaign, because I like it when my friends are happy.  But I'm concerned, too, because my friend wants to do a very ambitious Illusionist game using a traditional system.  I have played in very similar games with different GM's, and those games <i>sucked</i> for me, and I've got a lot of gamer-trauma associated with those styles of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI clearly need to alter my play style, and/or suggest some GM'ing techniques in a manner that won't bug my friend.  I'd appreciate suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n======<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - the basic idea of the campaign is something like this--and <i>I am entirely projecting here</i> because the GM hasn't really said what the campaign's about, we're just playing <i>Traveller</i>, but this seems to be the idea based on a few stray comments:<br/>\n<br/>\nA long-term Space Opera game involving a group of good-hearted mercenaries engaging in counter-terror operations in a region of space with disproportionate strategic importance, with a lot of high-risk combat, and plenty of questions about who to trust, and what's really going on, and a lot of reference to the Big Unanswered Questions of the <i>Traveller</i> setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn play and discussion,<br/>\n* The GM is very clear that there are mysteries &amp; conspiracies in this game, and we might not solve any of them, or even learn that they exist.<br/>\n* There's a GM-PC character, whom I foolishly alienated before realizing he was a GM-PC, leading to some tension at the table<br/>\n* There are some pseudo choices, of the, "Do you do X?  No?  Okay, nothing happens until you do X" type<br/>\n* There's a script worked out in advance, and the GM will reveal it to us as we move through it<br/>\n* The appeal of the game for the players, as far as I can determine, is all about Sim exploration of Setting<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very much not the style of play I'm used to; in some ways, it's the kind of play I've been trying very hard to avoid; but I want to figure out how to make it work for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the first question is: in Sim play, one of the big things is celebrating genre conventions.  The thing is, I don't know <i>jack</i> about <i>Traveller</i>.  What's some of the stuff I can do to make the distinctive elements of <i>Traveller</i> really sizzle as a player?  My guy is a very seedy wetware surgeon disgraced after a series of unethical experiments on terminally ill patients, now acting as an itinerant gene-splicer and smuggler of bio-contraband one step ahead of the law -- so anything that directly relates to this, or some piece of the setting that I can weave into my play, would be a huge help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second question is: how do I learn to love the GM-PC?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third question is: I know there's a lot of discussion about converting Illusionism into Participationism on the Forge, but it is very long and kinda fumbly as people are working out the meaning of the terms and whatnot.  Does anyone have a concrete list about how to address that stuff?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185843/#Comment_185843" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T18:05:06+00:00" title="January  3, 2009  6:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>What's some of the stuff I can do to make the distinctive elements of Traveller really sizzle as a player?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Not really anything.

Briefly, the PCs are teleported to a strange new world with a whole bunch of other people, one of whom, "the Colonel" is establishing civilization and order and expects the PCs to join ranks. In that game I immediately jumped off the tracks and tried to get home. All the PCs seemed to think this was a good idea as well. The GM was accommodating, but we went off into the unknown and never got to the fun. Lesson learned.<br><br>So the first thing I would do is craft character beliefs that enthusiastically support the GM set up. My character sheet should have had "I am looking for a great leader to follow!" in bold print.<br><br>In your case, I would do this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>There's a GM-PC character, whom I foolishly alienated before realizing he was a GM-PC</blockquote>Belief #1: I must impress GM-PC and win his trust!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>There are some pseudo choices, of the, "Do you do X?

I'm entirely unfamiliar with <i>Traveller</i>, so I don't really know what I should be noticing and grooving on.  Chris Kubasik wrote an awesome summary of the game as sort of a science-fiction version of [i]The Man Who Would Be King[/i], which is fucking brilliant, but that apparently isn't the Counter-Terrorism Technothriller that the GM is going for...                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185849/#Comment_185849" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T19:48:50+00:00" title="January  3, 2009  7:48PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing, it's to understand if your friends is playing like this because he think that it's the way you'll have more fun (after all, this is what it's written on a lot of traditional rpgs...), or if he simply doesn't care.<br><br>In the first case, simply explain what you want from gaming, and what you don't want (yes, I know that that it's not so easy in practice, but I don't see another way: do you really want to sit for hundreds of hours of THAT kind of game?)<br><br>In the second case, see him for pizza or for a movie, not for gaming.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185851/#Comment_185851" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T20:39:24+00:00" title="January  3, 2009  8:39PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, <br><br>So, I'd like to be all awesome and make this work for you. But truth is, if you don't know Traveler or the particular angles of Sci-Fi that your GM is using Traveler to hit, don't like being told a story rather than telling it, and may have a pixel-bitching GM.... then there isn't a lot you can do. <br><br>I mean, you can probably get some of the pixel-bitching (if its actually that, hard to tell from your summation) to stop by talking to the GM. Many groups can work out, over time, a kind of social signal system for those times when you get the "do X or nothing happens" pseudo-choice -- but its still a psudeo-choice following the GM's story. There are ways to learn to engaged with the internal state of the character in unavoidable circumstances which are quite fun for some players. There are ways to shift the game, if the GM will help, towards living in the world ('making memories of events you didn't actually live") rather than passively eating a story. <br><br>But all of these, they're still a style of gaming it sounds like you don't like. And doing it in a game with a genre you don't know. <br><br>So yea. My advice is either have some really honest talks with the GM, or cut bait.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185858/#Comment_185858" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T22:12:04+00:00" title="January  3, 2009 10:12PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple thoughts:<br><br>First off, do NOT engage in Adventure-Avoidance. Take the hook and run with it.<br><br>Second, this kind of set up, from when I used to run stuff in the way you're seeing the GM set it up, was always meant as an initial starting point, from which things then diverged, based on what the players were digging.<br><br>As play progresses, the Gm will tend to burn up their own initial set-up ideas, and more and more gear the game towards what the players are bringing to the game. This is a sort of natural progression.<br><br/>Finally, talk to the GM ahead of time a bit about scene-cutting, scene-framing, and fast-forwarding. If he gets it, it'll help avoid all kinds of pixel-bitching bullshit and fake choices. Trust the GM and run with it, and explain that you're really okay with jumping ahead to the exciting bits. Also, get your fellow character players involved with this, to make sure they don't engage in Adventure-Avoidance.<br/><br/>This too will help burn through the GM's plans <b>fast</b>, and get to the point more quickly where he is now gearing future adventures to the stuff the player-characters are up to.<br/><br/>In the course of going through the initial adventures that the GM is so hopped up to run, make sure to engage in extremely brief side ventures with your charactre that you're actually interested in. Suggest NPC contacts for your character. Whatever you do, don't side track badly. You want little vingettes, not spotlight hogging two-hour side-tracks. You're laying the foundation for future adventures by quietly feeding info about your interests to the GM. Think of it as reverse-illusionism. Also, you'll end up leading by example and the other layers will likely follow suit.<br/><br/>Finally, go rent Firefly and watch it. Make sure the GM has watched it. Hell watch it as a group. While you're watching it, make sure you make a comment like "Man, that's what I want a space game to be like: See how they hopped right into the story. That's awesome". Hopefully, everyone else will catch the hint.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185862/#Comment_185862" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T23:02:24+00:00" title="January  3, 2009 11:02PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2009 11:18PM by komradebob.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple other tips:<br/>Figure out which member of the Interstellar A-Team your character is, and what the other characters are. Everyone should have a really key thing they're good at during action sequences, and a second thing they're good at in non-action sequences. Make sure everyone is very clear on those things, especially the GM!<br/><br/>Also, this type of GM, if I'm right, will only have a couple of things in any given session that they desperately want to have in play: A cool villain, a fight scene at some nifty location, whatever. If they get to work that in, they'll be happy as a clam and give lots of leeway on the other stuff. Do what you can to help them get that into play, the same way you'd drive stuff towards the interests of your fellow players in a Narr game.<br/><br/>Finally, be aware of the Dr.Jekyll/Mr, Hyde GM approach. If this guy is at all like I was for many years, he'll be a bit of a soft-touch with things like PC death and TPK events, EXCEPT WHEN HE ISN'T!!!!<br/><br/>Meaning, you're probably safe surrendering or being captured.

That's like the perfect <i>Traveller</i> game."  So I'm like, "Whoa, I really dig <i>Firefly</i>, this will be great."  But the GM really meant to say, "Gang of misfits go on the mission of the week.  They talk about their feelings and whatnot in between."  Whereas I see <i>Firefly</i> as, "Adorable character archetypes resolve their personal issues through mission-of-the-week shenanigans."  This was a little frustrating to me, as I'd based my character on a mixture of Simon-the-Doctor and Jayne-the-Lout, only to be told this wasn't really appropriate to the game.  I think I've managed to resolve that dispute, but I think we were both frustrated with each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185887/#Comment_185887" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T08:26:00+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  8:26AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm.

Maybe it's more about exploring situations that result from a certain group of characters faced with missions, as KBob alluded to with his "A-Team" reference?  You can have good Sim play without really giving a fuck about "the world" of the game as long as you can generate some cool interactions.<br><br>My own most fun approach to the kind of GMing you describe is to team up with the GM.  "Okay, you're here to show us the cool plots and elements you came up with.  My character has his own brilliant plan of how to use these things for his own agenda!  I now care about everything you want to show!"  I strive to forge connections.  Offer things to NPCs, establishing good relationships with them.  Advertise yourself as a potential balance-tipper for every plotline.  "NPC Fred wants to overthrow NPC Lou and get his castle?  Well, our party is the perfect choice for a recon group to set up the overthrow by gathering info and knocking off sentries!"<br><br>Often, I wind up co-conspiring with the GM and betraying my fellow PCs.  GMs in this position love having a player to feed info too -- they don't want to "give away their secrets too easily", but keeping them secret from most of the players is the perfect midpoint!  Then, when I'm in the know, I can help steer the other players toward what I can identify as sources of player fun -- kind of being a player-centric GM translator.<br/><br/>That's all I have to add; most of what KBob's said has worked in my experience too.<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-David<br/><br/>P.S.  One specific technique for low-impact metagame communication: Ponder aloud about the possible meanings of things the GM has tossed out that might be hooks, giving him a chance to say, "Intriguing, eh?" for some, and, "Actually, that didn't seem important," for others.  Some GMs are more willing to do this than to answer direct questions like, "Which way is the plot?"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186076/#Comment_186076" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T14:13:49+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  2:13PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some more techniques/advice:<br/><br/>(Assuming that the other players are having a good time, of course.)<br/><br/>Problem 1: I don't know enough about Traveller/the game world<br/><br/>Ask the GM if you can change your character to be some kind of outsider or amnesiac. Someone who also doesn't know about what's going on. Then you can honestly ask about "how stuff works" in-game, and potentially use that information to create fun situations, especially by misunderstanding how things work, and playing off your character's ignorance.<br/><br/>It also helps remind the GM and other players that you, the player, don't know how the Traveller-verse works. They'll be only too happy to explain things to you. <br/><br/>Problem 2: What to do during the railroad?<br/><br/>I think the role of players in such a setting-exploratory railroady environment is just to come up with fun creative actions. Create weird situations (hide in the bathroom for no good reason while the Big Bad is exploring the ship, take the local Baroness hostage) just to see what happens. Once the appropriate story challenges are spotted, make it a game for yourself to come up with the most wonky and unusual way to solve them. Just try to do crazy stuff and see if it works.<br/><br/>Problem 3: Loving the GM-PC, contributing to the story<br/><br/>Of course, feel free to use indirect methods when direct ones fail. Mention outloud your theories about how things "really are". Make up some reason why the GM-PC is actually a really important person for you to befriend ("I just know he's secretly a rebel leader... that's why he's trying so hard to act like he's pro-Empire!"). The GM may end up using your ideas in the long term, even if for now everything just thinks you're crazy.<br/><br/>Speculate outloud out-of-game, and speculate outloud in-character as well. Eventually your ideas will work their way into the game and into the story.<br/><br/>If that fails for the GM-PC, then make a secret plan with the other players to kill him off. I'm with Luke on that one.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, of course, always mention stuff that went well during the game. "That was great!" Or even if it hasn't happened yet: "I love how the Princess, who we initially thought was a villain, is turning out to be in love with character X!" (Of course, the GM didn't know it until you said it, but now he does, and he just might go with it, especially if the other players light up when they hear that comment from you.)<br/><br/>If the people are fun enough, and all enjoying the game, you might be able to enjoy it as well, so long as you don't let your expectations climb too high.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186098/#Comment_186098" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T15:06:36+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  3:06PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2009 3:06PM by Alan.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone asked your friend wants to run it this way?
