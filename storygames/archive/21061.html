That's pure TotM.<br/><br/>In my group, we have an occasional player (not always there) who likes to use a map for the mazes, and I've been pretty cruel towards him. I've suggested he just make a node map (even for places where the DM map is gridded out completely), I showed him how I used to do them while playing text adventures like Zork. Looks sorta like a mindmap or flowchart. But the big rule I have is "I, the DM, am never ever going to look at that map. Don't show it to ask, nothing like that," I mean I sometimes look at the maps they've made after the session, pretty good usually.<br/><br/>I'm usually telling them things like "You can probably figure that behind that door is that bedroom you visited earlier, it's got to be the other side of the door in that room you never opened." Getting lost in the dungeon isn't really a thing in my game, I tell them if they do, but they almost never do because of the genius guy. In the group where I am a player once the lights in the dungeons went out and the DM took our map away. That was probably the most interesting moment because I stopped seeing myself as ant from top down and started imagining feeling the dirtbrown dungeon walls ahead of me.<br/><br/>I <em>never</em> say "north" btw. I point and say "left", "across" etc, that's one of the things I always have to mind when reading room descriptions in the modules. I am very deliberate in the way I've designed this and it's not really part of any OSR tradition, not even from the local group that taught me how to do it. But video games like "Hunter, in Darkness"have inspired me.<br/><br/>And I point alot, go up and measure things against the wall etc. Try to use some larpiness.

Usually, they map.<br/><br/>I happen to have a bunch of images of all the DM and many of the player maps from our last campaign.

When the players know that making maps is going to help them in concrete ways they get into it.<br/><br/>When we started off we had a regular who loved mapping more than anything, and set up a google drive folder. Every week, they would collect maps from everyone else there who kept them and combine them into his edited version. They would then charge in-game currency for access to the folder (contributors would get it for free or at least a discount, of course).<br/><br/>I do have to encourage new players to try it, because they certainly don't know about it's power. It also is a quick way of putting a new player into an important role. I am typically very helpful, glancing at a new player's first map and making the odd correction\u2014for the first little while. As they start to descend deeper, I start to use North less often and Left more often\u2014again with the idea that careful record-keepers will have an advantage. I am also quite generous to people who play Dwarf characters, I will often tell them a direction or distance that I wouldn't share with other characters.<br/><br/>What does it look like to reward mapping? Secret rooms in negative space on the map is a start. But one-way doors, or routes that are blocked by unusually difficult monsters who must be navigated around unless the party wants to take big risks are good. Sloping passages between levels, long stairs that skip levels, or sub-levels\u2014because knowing what level you are on, and a better map means you are quicker to orient yourself. Multi-part mechanisms. Cave dungeons where levels aren't horizontal, or other overlapping passages.<br/><br/>I also very very much love the player maps and sharing them as the product of my game in an artistic sense. I am hoping to maybe put together a little zine publication out of one of the dungeons we spent a lot of time in last year, from the players maps. One of my favourite parts of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461989/#Comment_461989" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T05:27:54+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  5:27AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2017 5:30AM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm happy to see people enjoying making maps and using them.

Please don't take this as a sort of refutation of your experience with these features with mapping because it does look that they enhance mapping and feel genuinely rewarding.<br/><br/>But in order to be perfectly clear about my technique I want to talk about what I look for in a DM map that works well with my style, and what I have to avoid because it rewards mapping so much that the players might demand that we switched to detailed mapping for them.\n<blockquote>What does it look like to reward mapping?</blockquote>\n<dl><dt>Secret rooms in negative space on the map is a start.</dt><dd>I'm really glad you started with this one because this is the one thing I have to be careful to avoid when choosing or making maps to run. Secret rooms, yes please, but the traditional "hmm, there should be a room here, look at this missing space" I don't rely on because that would make the players want a map that's gridded out perfectly. So one of the modules (Barrowmaze) that I really, really loved as a player (among the best experiences I've ever had ), I've hesitated to run for my own group because I was under the impression that it uses this design feature a lot, and dungeons that rely on it lose quite a lot of the experience since I discourage detailed measuring&amp;mapping.</dd><dt>But one-way doors, or routes that are blocked by unusually difficult monsters who must be navigated around unless the party wants to take big risks are good.</dt><dd>This I really love though, and see as a big plus when I'm choosing or making a DM map.

The GM only interferes when the mapping errors are so obvious that the characters can directly observe their error by looking around them.\n<blockquote>Do you draw a map at all?<br/>Or do you just use the GM's descriptions?<br/>Do you use the same method for both exploration and combat?</blockquote>\nWe don't map during combat. We've recently sometimes done a bit of positioning work with miniatures for certain combats, in which case the GM quickly places stuff on a battle map to indicate terrain, but that's not the mapping process - it's a separate thing.<br/><br/>In general combat descriptions of space are more immediate and less detailed, being as how the characters are usually focused on the presence of enemies, obstacles and exits, rather than the usual exploration detail.\n<blockquote>If you draw a map, is it a precise map? Like on squared/hexed paper, with precise measurements and directions as part of the GM's description?<br/>Or is it more of a conceptual/artistic/vague map? Something useful to help orient yourself in a maze, but not really a 1:1 representation of the dungeon.</blockquote>\nUsually the maps are the precise sort you're thinking of - 10 feet per square and so on. This conceit relies on the dungeon having been designed to such a scale, though, so the players are quick to abandon precise scale if the dungeon features a lot of precision-unfriendly, nonstandard geometries.\n<blockquote>Do you have the GM draw/deliver the map for you, while she describes it?<br/>Or do you draw it yourself? And if so, does the GM checks your work to ensure it is correct, or not?<br/>And if the map is not accurate, does it have any in-game consequences?</blockquote>\nWhen I GM, I only interfere when the player is drawing complete hogwash that the character, being there, would immediately spot as such. I will also clarify myself as much as necessary while a player is still learning my particular descriptive jargot.<br/><br/>It is entirely possible for mapping errors to lead to consequences. The most common one is that the players miss something or misanalyze the dungeon in some way.\n<blockquote>Is map drawing something the whole group somehow engages with and enjoys?<br/>Or is it something that only one of you (the cartographer) cares about? If so, does it bother the other players? Is it a necessary (?) evil?<br/>Or otherwise, what do you find fun and engaging about it?</blockquote>\nIt's how the game is played, I don't think that the players have strong feelings about it either way. They are free to drop it if they want, but they don't want to, because mostly they don't want to put in the concentration to build a mental map instead.<br/><br/>The big, fat advantage of a paper map is that it enables the players to relax: only one player needs to listen to the GM carefully room by room, corridor by corridor, while the rest can focus on other aspects of play. When something important occurs, the players can consult the map to get a quick sense of where the party is and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461997/#Comment_461997" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T07:59:45+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  7:59AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2017 8:15AM by adamwb.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do think\u2014and I read your other necro'd thread just after posting this which made this all the more clear\u2014that the first point there is definitely a do-or-do-not thing. As in: you've decided to not have concrete numbers for distance, and as such those things are absolutely not going to be a productive part of play, so you should avoid them. I made a decision that went the other way: I wanted to make maps a certain way, and I knew that I had to justify them.<br/><br/>But! I love them. Things about distance that I love: when the player keeping the compilation map discovers that different people have mapped a space different ways and they insist that the group goes back to check it out, even if they were just 10' off. Or: after exploring different parts of the dungeon, they discover that the passages overlap by just a little, and they end up spending a night figuring out whether they are in overlapping caverns or in a different level all together. Or: during a desperate fight, the party is cut off from itself and starts making guesses about how the dungeon fits together to blindly use <em>dimension door</em> or transform into something that can knock walls down. Or: a level that has parts that absolutely don't connect to each other without going to another level, and the party knows exactly where the thing they are looking for is but can't get to it without a major detour or major magic. Or: one player decides to start building their maps as architectural drawings in 3d in google sketchup.<br/><br/>Oh: I also like that they can be emergent\u2014that new players can start off making a not-to-scale map and get along just fine with that\u2014until they discover a secret corridor and realize that they could have spotted it's route already. I explain my procedures of making maps, sure, and offer help for new players, but I'll never stop them from using whatever tools they are comfortable with.<br/><br/>By multi-part mechanisms I mean puzzles that involve multiple rooms that affect one another, so a given trip to the dungeon means going back and forth through known or semi-known territory. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/10/how-unexplored-generates-great-roguelike-dungeons/" rel="nofollow">I just read some really interesting theory from a video game designer/math researcher</a> about how to structure this stuff that I am eager to think about the next time I sit down to make a dungeon.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I haven't so much had a chance to engage the same kind of dungeons I'm creating recently so I can't speak to what it's like on the other side of the table, so much. In the off-again-on-again stars without number game we play I've certainly done lots of mapping but it tends to be node-and-point style, in part because scale is so flexible there with vehicles and great visibility in the dark/lights and all kinds of other things. Actually another thing that other thread made me think of is how to present ranged weapons differently in my booklet\u2014because in the dungeon, and especially for new characters, the differences between them don't matter, everything is measured by in the light/outside the light/outside the room.<br/><br/>Here are a couple player maps though:<br/><br/><img alt="dragon's lair" src="http://adamwb.net/images/sstabz/dragons-lair.png"/><br/><br/><img alt="dungeon" src="http://adamwb.net/images/sstabz/dungeon.png"/><br/><br/><img alt="moor marey" src="http://adamwb.net/images/sstabz/moore-mary.jpg"/><br/><br/>These are all pretty old now, I should ask for some recent scans.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>There are other drawbacks too to specific mapping. For a while I was explicitly offering copies of the library map (the second pic is a small part of level one), compiled by that one former regular, of the main dungeon for groups of new players at eg. con games, available for in-game currency at its author's suggestion. But as the dungeon evolved\u2014I added a lot of additional passages and sub-levels\u2014it started to become a handicap. Even before that, new players tended to assume the map was complete, despite my telling them that if it's on the map, it's been explored, and so is likely to have less treasure/danger/adventure, they would try to follow the passages that were explored. So now I still bring it in my kit but I never offer it\u2014only players who are determined to find everything in town get it, and those players are ones who have had much more chance to learn about its limitations, and hopefully are ones who are more literate in some of what it represents, including its limits.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it was Ben Robbins or someone else talking about games based on his game but someone strongly suggested in some of the West Marches writing that there only be one map, a communal map, but this sort of thing makes me not think so, or at least that it's more complicated. Knowledge or ownership of the map is a major agency in the game, it lets you make a plan for the group, it lets you be a leader. But different groups need to access it differently, and sometimes a rumour is better than an measurement.<br/><br/>Certainly also the dungeon on a perfect grid is a weird anachronism in a fiction-first game. Sometimes I have urges to struggle against it: I am improvising a castle based on a plan of an eleventh-century Norman keep I found on wikipedia, let's say, and it's obviously not built on a real grid. But to say a room is roughly 10 feet across is a useful shorthand regardless, and I don't think it's too much to ask to recognize the map as the same kind of abstraction for the sake of the game as the general-store equipment list, or the organization of adventurers into Fighters, Clerics, and Magic-users. Like lots of things in this style of play, it's an object that bleeds back and forth between rules and fiction depending on the situation. So yes, I tell new groups, you should have two people make a map. What if one of them gets eaten with it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461998/#Comment_461998" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T08:22:48+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  8:22AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2017 8:33AM by adamwb.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh! something Eero said is really important: the players choose what speed to move at and what to map.<br/><br/>In the wilderness this is really visible in my game: in a boat, they cover distances in 24-mile hexes, where on foot, in 6-mile. They use a flying boat to get everywhere and sometimes when they have a long way to go they go up above the clouds and fight cockatrices and giants in order to be able to travel in 96 mile hexes and not worry about all that stuff.<br/><br/>Even in the dungeon, sometimes they know they want to get somewhere quick in the dungeon and are happy to use a map they already made or to just jot things down hub-and-spoke style and move quickly without measuring. But always, always they will decide differently than I have. In the examples I posted, the isometric 3d map is incredibly more detailed than mine, which I had made up on an index card in the hour before the session. If they had stuck with it they would have figured out how everything connects and I would have been checking their map to make sure I had the distances correct on mine! Instead they figured out that the actual dragon was in a different cave a mile North and this one just had like some spooky water spirit that could answer questions at the cost of your soul and poison air that killed their top magic user who was flying ahead to scout.<br/><br/>And all of this matters because of wandering monsters, which are based on time spent in the dungeon and number of hexes traversed (or time spent without moving) in the wilderness. Which i wonder if perhaps play a lesser role in your game Sandra, or are determined rather differently?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462000/#Comment_462000" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T09:06:01+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  9:06AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam &amp; Eero, great posts!

"Relax" is the perfect word for it but with the relaxation went my lack of engagement. I experimented by deliberately avoiding looking at the map and my imagination became much more vivid.<br/><br/>The shared map in the middle of the table had another great advantage, we players used it to talk to the GM. "We go here [point super deep into the dungeon, but everything already explored], let us know if we meet anyone on the way." or "We want to tear down [i]this[/i] wall and we want to build a new wall [i]here[/i]". It really sped up play. But, drawing the map slowed down play more <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> + it created a "the map is the territory" feeling for me, that those paper scrawls were the canon reality, and not the solid rocks and broken bones that really made up those tombs.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, oh! One thing my players did when confronted with a maze! They painted marks on the walls of that maze! That's the sort of "first-person thinking" that gets me wet as a DM!<br/><br/>Again, <i>please</i> don't stop doing what you're doing, you've got something great going there. For me, it would be too big a sacrifice from the play elements I value but for you, that sacrifice seems to have been an investment, an investment that has reaped great advantages, not only costs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462017/#Comment_462017" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T16:58:20+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  4:58PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2017 5:06PM by adamwb.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i recently had the pleasure of seeing a table full of new players open a door which a previous group had written \u201cdanger\u201d on because they were curious why someone would put that word there, only to lose half their number to striges so i certainly am on board with players marks in the dungeon! <br/><br/>actually, experienced players trying to warn new ones about the dangerous parts of the dungeon is one of my favourite tropes. one of my top stories ever was of a long-ago level one party led by a semi-regular who had been trusted with the group map\u2014but the treasure was thin and the new players were starting to chafe at his authority as he started to tell him that they couldn't go to a certain unexplored area because the previous mapper had measured out where a staircase came down from above that was known to be guarded by a wight. the disastrous ending involving him cutting off the cocky explorers from the party with burning oil to prevent the dead thing from following them back to the group, and one of them shooting him with an arrow through the flames in retaliation before being drained by the monster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462018/#Comment_462018" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T17:39:06+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  5:39PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            love it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462026/#Comment_462026" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-16T19:00:01+00:00" title="April 16, 2017  7:00PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to make a pretty strict rule about "measurements" and "accurate mapping".

I won't correct it unless there's some obvious mistake due to miscommunication on my part.<br/><br/>However, if you want to make a detailed, accurate map, you've got to have methods and time to do that. Running through a cavern with a torch ain't gonna do it. Now, maybe the group has the liberty of doing so... but, more likely, they'll be lacking either the resources, the skills, or the time - in which case out come the wandering monster rolls (or whatever else you use to pace the game in the dungeon).

If you're into "old school" dungeon crawling, than mapping is not a necessary evil but a desirable feature of the game. It's part of the experience, the same as making sure you have a 7 feet wooden pole to poke stuff at a distance, a mirror to check around corners, parchment and ink to map the dungeon at "exploration speed", and enough torches to last for the planned exploration time. It's a feature, not a bug.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're playing something like Dungeon World, than you'll probably just rely on the GM and be a lot more flexible with the mapping (if needed at all). But than again, DW doesn't even assume you need torches and that they only last X amount of time, etc (IIRC). It's a very nice game, but not Old School in any way whatsoever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462065/#Comment_462065" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-17T22:55:22+00:00" title="April 17, 2017 10:55PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm extrapolating from the previous posts, especially the ones with links to actual maps.<br/>And a bit from what I remember of my old Red Box days.<br/><br/>Nobody mentioned a specific game, but I'm assuming no one took DW as an example of OSR gaming <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>I personally am thinking about Red Box D&amp;D (not even 2nd or following editions) or stuff like Into the Odd, Lamentations, or maybe Torchbearer.<br/><br/>Peter what is your personal experience with OSR map making?<br/>Are you usually a GM or Player?<br/>Could you go through my first post and answer to some of those questions?<br/>It would be very interesting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462066/#Comment_462066" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-17T22:57:54+00:00" title="April 17, 2017 10:57PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your game is incoherent (not in a bad way) D&amp;D then maybe an exact map is not necessary. <br/><br/>For Molday D&amp;D games that are strictly adhering to exploration over combat then yes mapping is essential.

I played D&amp;D back in the old days (almost 25 years ago!) and then moved to AD&amp;D 2nd ed at some point but dropped it 20 years ago or so. It wasn't quite my thing. Also played Warhammer RPG and other stuff along those lines back then. My experience with dungeon crawling was as a player, but we never emphasised the whole map-making thing. Mega-dungeons were never in play.<br/><br/>Today, I'd totally play OSR in hardcore mode, especially stuff like LotFP and DCC and modules like Anomalous Subsurface Environment, Peril on the Purple Planet, Deep Carbon Observatory, etc. But I'd never GM those things. It's just not my style. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But who knows, I do have LotFP, so it could happen.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462070/#Comment_462070" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-18T01:37:39+00:00" title="April 18, 2017  1:37AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>From what I can gather ...<br/>Maps are cool artifacts and props, but producing them during actual play is usually seen as a pain that no one (except a few choice people) actually enjoys. And this is assuming that the map-making actually serves a practical function within the adventure.<br/>A chore. A necessary evil.<br/></blockquote>\nMost people in my game who map enjoy mapping. That might be some self-selection. But it is a choice like any other that the group makes when entering a new environment: part of this style of play is deciding who in the group is responsible for different things, whether that's who is walking at the front of the marching order, who is bringing fireball and who is bringing wizard eye this time, who is getting the precious healing resources, etc.<br/><br/>Also, mapping is a skill both in abstract and in particular, as the mapper learns the style of description the referee uses as well as the assumptions and style of a particular dungeon or level, or the different rituals of hex wilderness maps. The better a player gets at it the more fun they have.<br/><br/>I mentioned above encouraging new players to map who aren't inclined to do so. That's not because it's not enjoyable, it's because it is not always obvious how important it is.<br/><br/>I also wish I did more of it as a player and I am always ready to do it when I play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462073/#Comment_462073" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-18T05:04:25+00:00" title="April 18, 2017  5:04AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2017 5:16AM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hasimir, yeah, I was more of an outlier than an S-G consensus represention, but I do stand by my experiences and method. Hope noone felt I was misrepresenting the OSR-cred and practices of S-G.<br/><br/>I should've mentioned the games. In the game where I'm a player, with the map in the middle of the table, we've been playing Labyrinth Lord and Lamentations of the Flame Princess WFRPG with The Lost City, Barrowmaze, ASE and Dwimmermount.<br/><br/>What I run as DM I've talked about many times. A very deliberatery drifted 5e.

As a player, though, we've been hitting the modern OSR classics.<br/><br/>But, the practice of DM drawing the map deprives me of that old school sensation. They obv changed to that practice for a reason, but, I haven't protested.

On the one hand, it's deeply connected to my own sense of nostalgia, maps are awesome. I make quite nice dungeon maps (if I do say so myself), and I enjoy watching others make them - and there's a private joy when I see someone who has made a map of a space I've designed.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in my experience the player-mapper stands apart from the group to a certain degree. They're engaged in their own private sense-building of how the dungeon is laid out, and I find that the logistics of making their map equally visible to others tends to keep their spatial understanding isolated to just them.<br/><br/>The back and forth between GM and mapper isn't something other players can really jump in on, except perhaps for the two sitting immediately adjacent to them.<br/><br/>The other thing is that despite loving map-making myself, I tend to prefer theatre-of-the-mind <i>play</i>. What happens in complex spaces (by which I mean anything worth mapping) is that it tends to act like a magnet for the conversation. It's a crystallization of the mapper's understanding of the dungeon, so they tend to want to talk to the GM in map terms.<br/><br/>"Where is that on the map. Okay.. we're here, so where's the orc?"<br/><br/>I don't feel the same way about wilderness maps, because a) the percentage of time you spend mapping is a much smaller portion of play, and b) the scale is so obviously different from poking around and fighting that the two activities don't collide the map-vs-theatre-of-the-mind sense that dungeon maps do.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I've played another play style where the GM drew the map on a gridded whiteboard as we moved. That strikes me as a miniature wargame (which I also like), and quite a different experience. In that, the whiteboard map becomes the authoritative sense of where we are and what's going on, with additional descriptions (eg. "the walls are slimy") as mental additions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462169/#Comment_462169" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T04:03:09+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  4:03AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you hit several of my experiences perfectly, Fuseboy!
