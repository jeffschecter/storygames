An Asynchronous convention, but held on locally-synchronous weekend. 7 PM, wherever you are, or all weekend meeting up virtually with friends across oceans.<br/><br/>I'm thinking across multiple channels, so you'd have IRC/Skype/distributed games, as well as local meetups and house cons. Maybe some of the house cons could arrange audio/video so that there was a non-local seat at one table, with a player Skyping in or whatever.

I know people who regularly have a remote player (the robot head), and it seems to work fine, time differences aside (they play trans-Atlantic). I've played with a robot head GM and it worked well.<br><br>I guess what I'm imagining is a regular, normal old house con, but with parallel events all over the world on the same weekend. Game locally, face to face, in your own language. If anybody wants to hook up via robot head, that's totally great, but that wouldn't be the focus of the global event. Internet-based games (a la iCon) would also be happening that weekend. Maybe there would be a dedicated forum for coordinating, match-making, and sharing stories. There could also be some light programming, like "everybody try to run a session of Danger Patrol called <i>Atomic Queen of the Uranian Blast Pits</i>" or something.<br><br>Again, I'm just daydreaming at this point. Assuming it were to happen, given the shape of theyear, when would make sense to do something like this?

Like, May, or January (end of).<br/><br/>As far as online play goes, I used to play globally on online chats, and we worked out the time diff and language barrier no prob. People were able to organize when they wanted to play, and adjusted according to everyone's schedule. Typing is a different medium than talking, but I'm sure we could find a way to work it out! I like the forum idea. Or using twitter or another tool for real time updates. This kinda reminds me of that game of IAWA people were playing with two tables, one table was the gods and another the mortals who were affected by them. It'd be neat to set up events like that, or tournament style, so that even though we weren't in the same room we were affecting each others play.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280577/#Comment_280577" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T06:25:36+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  6:25AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason: Ah, I misread you first as well.<br/><br/>A "gaming con" that is basically parallel.
