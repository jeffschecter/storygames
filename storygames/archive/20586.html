The game is a quick, one-shot story game about surviving a harsh or alien wilderness. <b><a href="http://www.bendutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Perseverant-RPG-v0.7.pdf" rel="nofollow">You can read the game here</a></b> (about 60 pages including a 3 page quick start in the back).<br/><br/>I'll be acting as the facilitator, but I will make a character once I see things slow down a bit as I did last time. I'd like at least two other players than myself, but up to a total of five will work. To expedite, I'll use one of the starting scenarios from the back of the book: Jadid Sector, a space opera-esque exploration mission.<br/><br/><b>Changes from previous playtest:</b><br/>- Addition of Resource stack<br/>- New severity rules (roll under party size, add to party size. Roll over party size, keep.)<br/>- Overall cleanup of the text.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><b>Basics of a character</b><br/>Each character is made up of four descriptive <b>traits</b><br/>1. History<br/>2. Method<br/>3. Ideals<br/>4. Drive<br/><br/>When posting, briefly list your four traits and any relationships to previous characters that you can think of. <br/><br/><b>Basic resolution</b><br/><br/>Describe how you're trying to overcome the challenge, noting up to three relevant "cards" (your Traits or Relationships). You roll 1+ the number of denoted cards d6. 4+ is a success. Success lowers the challenge's severity by an equal amount. You return cards to your hand for each success you rolled, and leave others out of your hand for each failure. Complete failure (no successes) elicits a Setback.<br/><br/><b>Additional playtest rule: Resource Stack</b><br/><br/>When you first create your character, come up with one Resource that any one of us can use. I'll update this OP with those resources as we make some. There's more info on pg 52.<br/><br/><hr/>\n<h1>J\u200bADID\u200b S\u200bECTOR</h1>\n<i><br/>We are the first humans to attempt to colonize this new,<br/>exciting, and dangerous region of space</i><br/><br/><b>N\u200bATURE</b><br/>Alien Space\u200b: Bizarre planets, inexplicable phenomena,<br/>and sentient cultures hostile to humanity.<br/><br/><b>E\u200bRA</b><br/>2483 CE\u200b: Science has advanced to interstellar levels.<br/><br/><b>G\u200bOAL</b><br/>Establish a foothold\u200b: We\u2019re the tip of humanity\u2019s spear.<br/><br/><b>L\u200bOCATIONS</b><br/>1.

Critical temperature warnings, pressure leaks, and the ever creeping streams of liquid hot magma poured toward the <i>Luddite.</i><br/><br/>Yavin knelt on the edge of the brittle obsidian as the lava pooled and poured around him, he knew it was his time to make peace. At least he'd die trying to save his friends. The pressure built up inside and he felt his eyes begin to bulge, the heat instantly evaporating the sweat from his brow and back. He kept hammering away at the gravimetric nodule on the <i>Luddite</i>, it was almost in place.<br/><br/>Just - one - more - <i>hit!</i><br/><br/>Yavin shrieked in pain and terror as his atmosuit's defenses finally faltered under the intense heat of the lava. His nerves were seared away in an instant, and he knew that everything below his waist was gone. Blackness took him, and his comrades saw that he only had time to fix one of the nodules - they still had to get them aligned in order to get their failing ship off of this crumbling volcanic planet.</blockquote>\n<i>So I threw a fodder NPC away to set the scene.
