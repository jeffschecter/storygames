I use Aces as high cards. Ben and I were also using jokers (as defense only wild cards -- they stop anything but can't be used to attack or reverse). It worked well, at least in a single-deck game. The only reason that jokers aren't in the current document is aesthetic (there's something of an aesthetic mismatch for me between playing cards and kung fu already, and the jokers are an ultra strong reminder of it, so I tend to take them out).<br/><br/>Speaking of card rankings, I should also add that when cards of the same rank but different suit are played against each other, I use the ordering rules from bridge because they're well known (from highest to lowest: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs).<br/><br/>2. Yes! If you have an idea of what the other player has, sure, you can call out their less powerful traits. Once I replace the current "placeholder" martial arts with the developed ones, there should also be other reasons for sometimes choosing lower level traits -- due to the ways different styles will interact.

His discoveries, which were verified in our play:<br/><br/>1. There's a pretty simple optimal strategy in which you never actually attack.  You just block, dodge, and use reverses as your attacks, because reversals serve double duty (as a block and attack) and that means you wear down your opponent's cards faster and can get those late hits in when the other guy runs out of cards.<br/><br/>2. As in the above, effective defense is SO much easier than effective offense.  This also means that combos are almost universally a bad idea, because it's so easy to block them and they use so many cards that, if you don't land it, your opponent pummels the crap out of you when you run out of cards.<br/><br/>3. Neither of these are really noticeable as long as both players are attacking roughly the same number of times in each round and throwing combos about as often, but when someone starts playing a strong defensive game, their odds of winning go up drastically.<br/><br/>Now, it may be that some of this will change in the final version, when you have different forms interacting in interesting ways, but one thought we had was to try to simulate the slow accumulation of damage that happens when you block all the time in Street Fighter.  This would also help differentiate blocking from dodging.  Like, maybe if you block X amount, the other guy still gets to grab a card and record a hit.  Or something like that.  There's also that SF thing where a high block can be countered by a sweeping kick, which can only be dodged, not blocked.  I'm not sure how exactly you'd replicate that, but it's another thought.<br/><br/>Anyway, just thought you'd be interested in what happened for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140185/#Comment_140185" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T07:35:04+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  7:35AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2008 7:57AM by Eric.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...big error in my post, reposting when corrected...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Forest" title="Rich Forest"><img alt="Rich Forest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2304/2385429537_23274b76cf.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Forest">Rich Forest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140196/#Comment_140196" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T08:27:38+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  8:27AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback. That matches my experiences as well. (And in fact, it used to be even worse in the earliest versions of the game, when Spades was a trump suit.) <br/><br/>This confirms my general suspicion that there are still too many ways to defend successfully, and reversals are too effective. Your description of combinations rings true to me as well. One of the current rules, that where both players are tied, the player with more cards has to play next is something of a kludge to help fix the problem, but a) it doesn't really solve the fundamental issue and b) I dislike it in principle because it messes with the free flow of initiative at the core of the system. It's a tacked on solution that still doesn't go far enough. <br/><br/>I have some ideas about how to fix this that have to do with restricting the availability of blocks and reversals by style, so that (for example) a style like Boxing might get full access to blocks and reversals to defend against strikes but only partial access to blocks (and very limited reversals) against kicks, and maybe no blocks or reversals at all against grapples. Something to that effect. I have not worked out the implications fully, though. Your suggestion about block damage has merit as well. Actually, following up on it, it might also be possible to give characters a small pool of points worth of maneuvers based on style. So, for example, a boxer might be allowed X number of blocks per round, Y number of reversals, perhaps also limited by type. <br/><br/>I'll put some thought into it and try to get some ideas into the text. <br/><br/>I am really happy to hear any other suggestions, of course. My main concern is to try to solve this problem while a) allowing a certain amount of style variation that b) doesn't bog down game play by requiring players to track too many pieces all at once. <br/><br/>So thank you! I'm out here thinking and listening. <br/><br/>Rich                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140242/#Comment_140242" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T12:39:02+00:00" title="April 17, 2008 12:39PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sans the more detailed rules for styles, what if you just increased the base damage of an Attack to 2 while keeping the damage of a Reversal at 1?<br/><br/>Also, paired with this, you could have Blocks reduce damage by 1, while Dodges negate it entirely.

I'd be particularly interested in what behaviors develop in the basic system in your play (I suspect they'll match Jonathan's and my own, but sometimes people do come up with interesting workarounds). And then I'd be interested in how your proposed changes play out, as well. My experience has been that the game can still hold together with about a one (maybe two) card starting gap between players, but not much more than that. If unblocked attacks knocked two cards out of the opponent's hand, that might shift the balance too far... but then again, it might just work. <br/><br/>I'll definitely have to test it out. <br/><br/>Thanks for the suggestion.

A Like slapjack, I'd suggest having a card onto which players have to play theirs. So that everyone has a target, and you don't get people slapping down cards in different areas. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, for the really competitive, you could have a rectangle... if the card is not entirely inside the rectangle, it is put in the damage pile. The rectangle is only large enough that one card must end up on top of another... call it the arena...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for players being forced to attack... you have to put in a taunt rule, ala TROS. Play a card and announce Taunt - describing the associated taunt - if the player can't defend, he's forced to attack. He doesn't take damage, but he has to attack next. At the very least, if you don't adopt something like this, discarding to force the player to attack should require that taunting should be described. Or taking no stance, from the TROS rules... Hmmm....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not clear... if you attack me, do I have to defend by playing a card? Can I just take it? The way the rule is currently written, it's not clear whether or not I must respond with a card. Makes a huuuuge difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, very similar but slightly different, if a player has a card that could defend, must he play it to do so? Or can he play a card that fails intentionally, even though he did have a card that could have won. I'm not sure if there are strategies where this would be tactically sound, but there might be. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs it stands, can a player with more cards choose to discard down to less than his opponent, rather than attack? Or is it only when they are tied that this is an option? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI sussed out the strategy that Jonathan notes right away. The blocks are too powerful. They allow you to get a lot of milage out of your low cards that you can't get from using them to attack. It's not the reversals that are the killer, it's this effect (reversals only make it worse). Yeah, the Samurai masters would approve, but this probably doesn't make for good play. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... how about a block prevents the "hit" from being scored, but it hurts to block, and you lose a card anyhow? Just what occurs to me off the top. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor Combos, to make them more desirable, the opponent has to throw down a defense card, but it only works against those cards that it's higher than, and the others in the combo score. The defender can, therefore, choose to throw down extra cards, which can also block the cards in the combo based on their suit. So if you lead your combo with a nice light initial punch, then the opponent has to decide wether to try to take it all out with one big dodge, or to take out that element with a lower card, and risk taking some damage from the stronger follow ups, or he might cover his bases with some blocks. <br/>\n<br/>\nWould make for some much more intense strategy. And it counters the other big advantage of defending, which is that you know what you're up against. Combos obfuscate your attack. In fact this might be so good that it might eliminate single card plays. But that might be just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also note that there's a built in "feint" maneuver. Make to throw down a card, but don't quite get to setting it down, hoping to get the other player to react too quickly. He may end up hitting the table with a card that's not well thought out, or he might reveal a card only to pull it back before it hits the table. Now you have some info on his hand. If he sees that you're not revealing it, however, he'll pull up in time. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you see this in play? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, this entire game is somewhat related to the Game Theory idea of Nim. But with hidden information. Interesting. I think that you should not reshuffle until something makes that happen in play, or you're forced to. A fun mechanical thing. Players who have good memories will have some advantage in play (the boardgame designers tend to say that "hidden trackable" information is bad, but in a game about speed... allow them to track on paper if they like, go ahead. And fast players may stomp em.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a standard part of most card games, and most players don't mind it (in Sheepshead, you must memorize every important card played in order to play well, and there are recognized methods for accomplishing this).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'd prefer to use the jokers. But what you really need to do is give them some special power. Like capturing a card from an opponent or something. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140380/#Comment_140380" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T13:29:21+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  1:29PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2008 1:30PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one more thing to add to the above post:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really want to weaken reversals, have them have to discard a card to do a reversal. They can sacrifice a low card to do so, and they'll probably score a card from their opponent when their nice high card (since it beat another of that suit), hits. Strategy becomes trying to get your opponent to reverse on a card that you have an even higher one of that suit. So he burns his cards reversing, and you reverse him right back. <br/>\n<br/>\nGives a good reason to throw that 8 of spades when you're holding the ace... but will the opponent fall for it? Of course, if he reverses your 6 with an 8... and you have the Queen... does he have that king that's still out there? <br/>\n<br/>\nOr does he just think you're out of spades. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why it's probably good that a player can play to fail when he doesn't have to. You could block with that King of spades against his ace of spades, but maybe it's better to let that ace hit, and lull your opponent into a false sense of security about whether or not you have any spades left. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140475/#Comment_140475" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-19T10:58:36+00:00" title="April 19, 2008 10:58AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Rich,<br/><br/>My friend Jason and I played this a bit yesterday; we're both huge wuxia fans, so it was a lot of fun!<br/><br/>Since it was my first time actually getting to play it, we went with the rules as-written, rather than trying any variations.  The strategy played out pretty much exactly as expected, with both of us warily holding off on attacking, until it became clear that one of us had to take the initiative (the person with more cards).  We had several "double reversal" instances like what Mike mentions above, which were super fun when they occurred.  He'd play a card, I'd reverse it, and then he'd reverse on top of that.  More than anything, those instances captured the feel of a crazy kung fu battle for me.<br/><br/>We also had the same question come up that Mike mentioned above: Do you have to play a card in response to blow?  If you can't block, dodge, or reverse an attack, do you just take it (and lose a card) or do you have to lay something down that doesn't work and then take it, effectively losing two cards?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
