I'm just lamenting the fact that there is so much story- and indie-gaming awesomeness going on in and around MA, and it has all happened since I moved away.  Seriously, I feel like I'm missing out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sort of turn this thing towards usefulness, I'm thinking of trying to take an active hand at the LGS here; find out what distributor(s) they get their RPG stuff through, see if it's feasible for them to start stocking small press stuff, possibly start running weekly games of different indie stuff to introduce people and get a bit of a community going.  Anybody have any advice on that front?<br/>\n<br/>\n(This moroseness is probably based on my leaving my play group behind in CA, and also being physically ill - sicker than I have been in the last couple years.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58701/#Comment_58701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T08:52:47+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  8:52AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find the best way to talk to LGS people is just to go up and ask.

Not the nicest gaming store I've ever been to, but far from the worst.  Another part of my ulterior motive, aside from pushing the anarchist hippie gaming agenda, is that I've been thinking of trying to run con games at some point, and it seems to me that running semi-anonymous games at a local store is a good intermediary step.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58799/#Comment_58799" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T14:06:59+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  2:06PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2007 2:07PM by J_Walton.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Atlanta is right in the middle of the hunting grounds of The Wolf.

You just don't know who they are.  All you need is a way to identify them.<br><br>Findplay, if it gets functional, is a good start.  So are local gaming conventions, as well as related conventions.  Take a look at board game conventions or SCA groups and the like.  I guarantee you there are some roleplayers among them.  And then there's a little shindig near you called <em>DragonCon</em>.  Start identifying gamers, gathering their contact information, and then start putting together little one-shots.  Pick a nice, neutral location like a park on a weekend and get together a handful of folks to try <em>Roach</em>.  Then the next month (or the next week, or whatever), get a slightly different group of people together and play, I dunno, <em>Octane</em> or something.  Repeat as necessary.  Eventually you'll be in a position where no matter what you want to play, you'll know a few guys who'd be interested in playing it.<br><br>If you get really energetic, you can <a href="http://nerdsocal.com" rel="nofollow">put up a website</a> to <a href="http://nerdnyc.com" rel="nofollow">help gamers network</a> and before you know it, people that you introduced are off gaming on their own.<br><br/>This is one of those things where your biggest enemy is overcoming the initial inertia to start.  Once the ball gets rolling, however, gamers start coming out of the woodwork like <em>crazy</em>.  I've been consciously and intentionally networking gamers for just over one year, now, and I have more gaming opportunities than I can fit into a week.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59984/#Comment_59984" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T14:34:18+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  2:34PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's kind of a strange, but I don't own <i>Roach</i> or <i>Octane</i>.

There wasn't much activity on it for some time, then one of the members (hi Matt!) invited a few other members (myself included) down to the pub and we spent a few hours talking about the games we all want to play and how we can make Portland a better place for Indie games. Matt ltached onto the idea that he could use the group to pitch a different game every month. I wasn't too suprised to find that once someone offered to facilitate a game there would be plenty of people willing to play it. His first go was Roach back in Jan, which went really well. Travis Brown latched onto the idea that  out lack kluster loal show Gamestorm could be repurposed as a 3 day indie game event. He's organizing a booth, scheduling games and panels, setting up demos and getting people excited for what has traditionally been a dull con. For my part, I've decided to organize an almost monthly game night at my home where I invite over 10-14 people and we play games. The first time I did this was in Jan. We had Beast Hunters and Panty Explosion, and the whole thing went pretty well. We're trying it again this Sat with Capes, Sign in Stranger and The CrossRoads of Eternity. Should be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when Colin, Mathew, Travis and I first sat down at the pub we thought putting together and encouraging an Indie games community in Portland would be a lot of work. Turns out it was complete cake, and players have come out of the woodwork. The one thing we are still missing though is a local store that carries the games we want to play, but even without that we've been able to build a nice community.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I just got Don't Rest Your Head and Panty Explosion in the mail today, so I'm off to spend some time reading 'em.</div>\n</blockquote>\nThanks for ordering Panty Explosion!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
