Part of my disappointment is the disappointment of high expectations.  Being a big fan of Dragon Age: Origins I wanted this game to excite me as much as the PC game has, and with Chris Pramas as the designer I figured there was a pretty good chance of getting just that.  Unfortunately...no.  At best the mechanics of this game are "functional" frequently they're downright "meh" and at worst...some really poor gamer math.  Now I suspect that much of the weakness in this design is the result of needing to put out a licensed product on a time limit, I don't know that for sure, but it seems a reasonable assumption.  Now given that they've indicated that this game became the best seller at the Green Ronin store for the year in the very first day it was offered it seems like it was a good business decision (depending, of course, on how much that license cost) but I'm interested in whether the game is actually worth playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Disappointing Thing #1:</b>  I was really hoping for a detailed setting guide to Thedas, something that would take the amazing wealth of little details uncoverable in the game from dialogs with characters and read in books and organize it into a text that I could refer to long after the game is no longer installed on my hard drive.  Unfortunately that was not to be.  The setting information is scanty, and in some cases contradicts the PC game.  Worse IMO is that it falls prey to the usual RPG setting text error of declaring the setting as if it was Fact-From-On-High.  The beauty of the Dragon Age Origins setting is that so much of it is presented from a variety of perspectives, many of which are contrary...leaving the player (much as with real world history) to piece together their own understanding of events.  Not so the TTRPG where everything is laid out in far less interesting "this is how it happened" fashioned.  Verdict:  I already know more about the setting from playing the PC game then the RPG provided.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Disappointing Thing #2: </b> The game is designed to be incomplete.  The box set currently available is "Set 1" the book refers to Sets 2, 3, and 4 being on the way (though it doesn't indicate what those are).  Why is this disappointing rather than merely annoying?  Well because the rules for playing Gray Wardens...not included in Set 1.  Yup that's right.  The whole point to the PC game...not included in the TTRPG.  Further, while the characters can level all the way up to 20, much like the old D&amp;D; box sets, only levels 1-5 are included in Set 1.  I suspect they'll be doled out 5 levels per set requiring a ton of book hunting and flipping to find the level information you're looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Disappointing Thing #3: </b> Not only can you not play a Gray Warden, you are specifically forbidden from playing nobility...even the lowest rung of nobility, the knight.  Yep...the rules are quite clear...you must "earn the right" to play a nobleman or Gray Warden &lt;shakes head sadly&gt;.  So get this.  In the PC game there are 6 possible character backgrounds.  2 of them are nobles.  And within the first couple hours of play you are recruited into the Gray Wardens and spend the rest of the game as a Warden.  But not in the TTRPG.  So any PC gamer new to TTRPGs who picks up the game thinking of maybe continuing the adventure of their favorite character...nope.  I still can't fathom that design decision.  If I were designing the game, the ability to play the continuing adventures of your PC character would be design goal <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  Oh, and two of the starting characters are Dwarves from Orzammar...and you can't play them either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Disappointing Thing #4: </b> Some of the most boring dice mechanics of recent years.  So here's the system.  Roll 3d6 add them up.  Then add your attribute (-2 to 4).  Then, if you have an appropriate focus +2 (yeah...there are skills...but the skills don't have levels...its just a flat +2 for having it).  Roll against a GM set target number.  Here's the big twist...one of the d6 is a different color (the Dragon Die), and the number rolled on that die is the degree of success.  Also, if you happen to roll doubles then the number on the Dragon Die gives you "stunt points" to do extra tricks with.  Kinda cool, but that means all the fun stuff you might want to do (like mighty blows, or duel weapons strikes) you can only do if you randomly roll enough stunt points.  That's it.  Quick, easy, functional...but hardly state of the art.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Disappointing Thing #5: </b>  Ok...so an average attribute is 1.  A good starting attribute is 2.  And if you're a warrior you'll probably have a focus in your preferred weapon group.  So you're rolling 3d6+4.  The typical opponent has a defense (target number) of 12-15.  Which means at 1st level your dedicated warrior has an 83% chance of hitting the weaniest creature in the bestiary but only a 50% chance of hitting one of the tougher ones.  A less fighty character (say with only 3d6+2) the chance is 62% to 26%.  Thing is...as you level up...you really don't get much better.  Since the skills have no levels, the only way to improve is increase your stats.   By 5th level you can only improve a stat by 2 points, but more likely you'll spread that around more.  After that...there is no improving your chance to hit that I saw.   Typical damage is 2d6+2 while most monsters have 16-22 HPs so you need to hit 2-3 times to kill a creature.  That's like 3-6 attacks to put an opponent down.  Pretty bog standard make initiative roll, make to-hit roll, roll for damage stuff.  The only excitement comes from maybe, once in a while, rolling enough random stunt points to do something else besides say "I attack...again"<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Disappointing Thing #6: </b> Ranges, special moves, and the like are all given in yards.  So no abstract, creative, or clever positioning mechanics going on here.  More bog standard moving minis around on a map and measuring distances.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Conclusion:</b>  1994 called, they want their game design back.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246388/#Comment_246388" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T00:20:57+00:00" title="December 13, 2009 12:20AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is as I had feared.

Only in easy tasks is it possible to get a mediocre level of success.  Say your rolling 3d6+2 if the difficulty is 12 you can succeed with any number on the Dragon Die.  If the difficulty if 18, then you can't ever succeed with anything less than a 4 on the Dragon Die.  No scraping by by the skin of your teeth on the harder rolls makes the system rather dubious to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills as yes or no toggles seemed nifty to me too, when I was reading the character creation rules.  But when you do the math its really annoying.  First, any fixed add on a summed die pool has completely different effects depending on where the difficulty is set.  Say you're rolling 3d6 +2 with another +2 for having the skill focus.  If the task is Hard (TN is 15) then the focus means you only have to roll an 11 instead of a 13 to succeed.  AN 11 is twice as easy to roll than a 13 so that mere +2 just doubled your chance to succeed.  If the task is only Challenging (TN is 13) then the focus means you only need a 9 instead of an 11.  A 9 is only 50% easier to roll than an 11.  If the task is Imposing (TN 19) then you'll need to roll a 15 instead of a 17 with is about 5x easier to do.  So, on the surface you'd think...ok having a focus helps more with the harder tasks than the middle of the road tasks...that kind of seems sensible.  But then you realize that that effect doesn't really kick in until the rolls are whifftastic anyway (even with the focus you only have a 10% chance of making an Imposing check).  Second it means that even though the characters are expected to grind through 20 levels...they never really get actually better at anything.  They'll get better at more different things...but once they buy a +2...that's it.  Third...from a character perspective it means all trained swordsmen are equally good...there's no variety.  There's no phenomenal master swordsman.  Once you're trained you're the same as everyone else...that strikes me a profoundly uninteresting.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading the dice in multiple ways had a bunch of potential.  Like say...Rolling Doubles (which I think is about 1 in 3 rolls if I did the math right) lets you immediate take an extra turn for that powerful combo move.  Or rolling high on the Dragon Die gives the player the ability to name one additional benefit that happened from the roll, or things like that...that would have been cool.  But the implementation as is, is a definite missed opportunity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nojh" title="Nojh"><img alt="Nojh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nojh">Nojh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246411/#Comment_246411" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T07:52:36+00:00" title="December 13, 2009  7:52AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. So how does the setting guide stand on its own? Is it enough information about the world to run/play a game of DragonAge from first to fifth level? I do think your expectations here were a little high. Expecting an RPG book to present a world setting similar to a novel or video game while unique, would also make the actual game play difficult for your GM. Additionally I've never found an RPG book or a guide book that offers more than a little extra information than the source material, at best. Most of the time it just offers a condensed version of what you need. Hopefully this book gives you that at least. Thats what I've come to expect. I cite the Warcraft/World of Warcraft RPG for examples of this. Besides, most RPGs only ever offer you an overview of the world to start with anyway. Details are what expansions are for.<br>\n<br>\n2. I followed the design blog of the game. If I remember correctly, the game is designed to be a gateway RPG for those who play the video game but don't play tabletop RPGs. Yeah I know there is nobody here who does that but video gamers who don't outnumber us traditional gamers by a significant amount. So it makes sense to make a game that, at its core, is simple, but can be easily expanded later. Which means multiple sets. It sounds like you personally want to wait till set 3 or 4 comes out and you can start the game as an advanced character similar to your video game character. I can understand this. I don't necessarily like playing first level characters <br>\n<br>\n3. Well I can fathom a reason. Obviously the first-fifth level characters are not as powerful as your starting computer game characters. So this was a decision for gameplay vs realism. That being said I think perhaps you are justified here. People are going to expect to be able to play a gray warden at the very least. So they probably should have released both Set #1 and Set #2 (where I assume you're likely going to be able to play Wardens and Nobles) at the same time. Bad marketing decision I suppose.<br>\n<br>\n4. I feel it is a poor expectation to always expect an "innovative" mechanic system. You should instead ask if the game mechanic system best supports the game play you like and/or fits the theme well. In this case it sounds like the mechanic system is both simple (for introductory players) and fits the theme of the game (having stunts and degrees of success). It is simple enough to be a gateway for new players which fit their design goals.<br>\n<br>\n5. 50% chance of hit against the toughest enemies if you're trained, sounds pretty decent to me. I mean we're talking about the /toughest/ enemies in the world right? So a first level character can hit a dragon 50% of the time. That seems impressive to me. Or am I misunderstanding? I can understand the disappointment of missing when you really want to hit.But if you spread those 3-6 hits among a party of players, that doesn't sound so bad.<br>\n<br>\n6. Personal preference for myself is not to mix in real world units too. Unnecessary complication. But I think that is mostly my emotional baggage from high school geometry class.<br>\n<br>\nUltimately though it does sound like a game that the more experienced of us want to wait for more books before we jump into it. Unless we're uber fans of the video game.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246415/#Comment_246415" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T08:40:23+00:00" title="December 13, 2009  8:40AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing I thought of when reading that resolution system description: roll a 4th die as your Dragon Die and don't add it into the total, but DO count it for doubles.

That being said I think perhaps you are justified here. People are going to expect to be able to play a gray warden at the very least. So they probably should have released both Set <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and Set <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (where I assume you're likely going to be able to play Wardens and Nobles) at the same time. Bad marketing decision I suppose.</blockquote>\nExcept the starting characters aren't more powerful than a character from the TTRPG.  Starting characters in the DA:O video game are level one with standard stats, one skill, and one talent.  Same starting abilities as those that TTRPG characters get.  <br/><br/>As for playing a Warden, I've got to agree with your sentiment, as well as the going one with others here too.  In the video game you become a Grey Warden by about level three or so, depending on how quickly you move along.  That's well within the confines of the "Level 1-5" area of Set One of the TTRPG.  And the Grey Wardens are a perfect entry into the world of Thedas.  There's monsters to fight, politics to figure out, all of that good stuff.  I can't think of a better situation for a campaign set in DA:O, especially for that "new to gaming" market that Green Ronin is aiming for.  And that's the main reason that I am skipping out on the set.  Not being able to play a Grey Warden out of the box seems like a massive misread on the setting and video game that inspired this RPG, and it leaves me suspicious as to what else they may get wrong.  <br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this game as well.  I love the video game with all of my little gamer heart, and have spent way too many hours doing the first playthrough of it.  If I do decide to run some adventures in the DA;O world, I may just take Green Ronin's superb Song of Ice and Fire RPG and use that instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246420/#Comment_246420" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T08:53:40+00:00" title="December 13, 2009  8:53AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the chance of getting a double on 3 dice is 44%, so pretty often.

And just because RPG setting books have a tradition of suck, doesn't mean we can't set the bar higher.  There are plenty of ways to deliver setting in an RPG book that would have been superior to the way it was done.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) That goal is poorly realized.  If I'm a player of the PC game who is trying TTRPG for the first time, I'm going to expect to play my Noble Dwarf Exile from Orzammar who is recruited into the Grey Wardens and goes on a quest to save the world.  I'm going to expect to hit 88% of the time, to attack several times in a 15 second round, and to choose which special attacks I want to use and what order I want to combo them in...because that's how the PC game works.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead what I get is no ability to play nobles, no ability to play dwarves from Orzammar, no interesting Origin stories already laid out for me (or even a place where I get to create my own), No Grey Wardens, characters who attack once per 15 seconds of fictional time and once per 2-3 minutes of real time, hit only 1/2 the time with no ability to choose my special attacks at all unless I get a lucky roll.  If this was to be a gateway RPG for the PC gamers than design goal numero Uno should have been to capture the experience of the PC game.  The game should have started you out with the characters from the PC game as sample characters, the character creation rules should have looked similar to that of the PC game, the players should have started as heroes not as scrubs and the mechanics should have been fast playing yes...but also interesting and able to be manipulated in fun ways.  As a gateway game...IMO  Epic Fail.  Only long time TTRPG gamer grognards can be forgiving of the flaws in this game because they're the flaws we've been used to forgiving for years.  For gamers who already think TT Roleplay is lame...they're going to look at this game and say "yup...lame...like I thought".<br/>\n<br/>\n3) They should have started from the premise of playing Grey Wardens period.  Only TT gamers are obssessed with the "I want to play anything" idea.  PC gamers are used to playing the characters the game allows.  If I were designing this game I would have gone back to the last Blight so as not to trample on the subsequent PC titles, and set the game up to showcase the campaign of the Gray Wardens to end the Blight...cuz that's what Dragon Age Origins is about.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Boring is not good.  Lame is not good.  Bad math is not good.  Its not a question of innovative means complex.  Hell, look at Don't Rest Your Head...a wonderfully fun, flavorful, and thematic die system that's a breeze to use.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) No, you're talking about the toughest enemy in the book...which is a Dragonling...the book only includes the weanie monsters.  No Alpha versions, no Drakes, no Dragons.  Perhaps set 2 will introduce Advanced Focuses to let you hit the tougher monsters but the monsters in the book are all the low level stuff.  And 50% to hit for a dedicated fighter?  When in the PC game your dedicated fighter is going to hit in the 85% range.  And swing MANY more times than you can resolve easily on the table top?  Just a really bad way of capturing the feel of the PC game, and a demonstration of embedded TT gamer-think...Initiative, Roll to Hit, Roll for Damage...Bah.  Why not one roll that tells you not IF you hit.  But instead, how many times you hit.  Maybe a pool where each die is a blow, and if you can get the right combination of numbers you can string together an Overwhelm or Assault combo?  Lots of better ways of portraying Dragon Age combat than was done here.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) I'm not talking about real world units vs fictional units.  In the game, range is almost immaterial.  If you can see it, you can hit it (unless its a cut scene monster that won't let you attack until the cut scene is triggered).  The only thing range does is give you a penalty if you're beyond "effective"...which is pretty invisible in the game.  As for melee -- the only thing that matters is which characters are ganged up on which monsters, which characters are getting ganged up on, keeping your mage out of melee, and taking a flanking position.  There is no "movement rate" or engagement range, or any of that classical TT RPG baggage.  Why not go with a system that models how the PC game plays.  These are the monsters. Put your characters up against each monster.  Any left over monsters the GM puts where he wants.  Then you can have Talents in the TT game similar to the PC game.  In the PC game one of the most important Tank powers is Taunt...which gets the baddies to focus on your tough guy instead of your mage.  So hey a focus that lets the player take one of the monsters the GM was allocating and make it attack him instead.  Then you have these little knots of whose fighting who and who's sniping from the outside and which rogue is going from engagement knot to engagement knot avoiding attacks while dishing out massive back stab damage.  It would not have been hard to create a system that works like that...instead of works like a tired old hack of D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lost opportunity here is tremendous.  If I had the time, I'd talk myself into designing "Drakkon Era", the Dragon Age RPG the way it could have been done...so that it actually plays like Dragon Age rather than like some warmed over GURPs light.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246425/#Comment_246425" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T09:23:48+00:00" title="December 13, 2009  9:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what happens in the TTRPG when your hit points go to zero?

Perhaps GR are in some ways hoping to recreate the intro roleplaying experiences that many of them remember from the boxed sets of the late 70s and early 80s.  I'm just speculating on all this, but it's possible that some of the default assumptions of retro-tabletop are clashing or competing with the game experience of the Dragon Age video game.<br><br>Also, you wonder in these sorts of licensing situations, when the game is on a short time table, at how much access Green Ronin got to the Dragon Age video game pre-release.  I fully agree with Ralph that, ideally, what you want is a tabletop game that replicates and then extends the experience of the licensed property (and stand-out products like Mouse Guard certainly do this).  But working with a big, secretive company like EA on an unreleased product is not the same as working with an independent comics publisher on a published property (and even then Luke seems to have had several headaches with Archaia).  Honestly, I don't think I'd want to work on the adaptation of a video game I couldn't personally play through, but that may not have been the case here.<br><br>However, Chris did post that "I would draw inspiration from the computer game, but ultimately the tabletop RPG would be its own animal."  Personally, I agree with you that this is probably the wrong decision for a licensed game hoping to bring new players into tabletop, that it would be better to replicate the video game experience more closely, so, in the end... yeah.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246444/#Comment_246444" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T11:44:32+00:00" title="December 13, 2009 11:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2009 11:47AM by J_Walton.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just found verification of my Olde Skool theory:<br><br><i>I designed a new game to capture the feel of the Dragon Age world, but I did so very much mindful of the history of tabletop RPGs.

I felt like there were still important things we could learn from those games, lessons perhaps forgotten over the years to the detriment of the hobby.

My expectations for both products were fairly low.<br><br>Dragon Age managed to disappoint even given those low expectations. Its a low quality traditional roleplaying game, poorly customised to the setting, Not only that but its woefully incomplete.<br><br>Doctor Who on the other hand is outstanding. If you get your hands on a copy, do what I did. After you've finished taking in the work that went into layout and incredibly high production values open the Players Guide to page 53 and start reading the rules on how a Skill roll works, the importance of intent in determining the outcome, the introduction of complications, the use of 'Yes, and' or 'No, but' to build stories and the importance of player narration. Now turn to page 74 and read the whole section on story points. By this point you should be feeling that maybe there is more to this game than almost any other licensed game. I then turned to the GMs guide and read about social conflicts, checked out the section on using any skill in a conflict, and then headed to the sections specific to its subject matter (Dr Who). By this point I knew I had something special.<br><br>Does the game introduce anything truly new? Not that I've found, but it full of ideas which have proven very successful good story games. Reading it reminded me in many places of reading Spirit of the Century. Its beautifully produced, complete in and of itself, and perfectly customised to its source material (Dr. Who). The main thrust looks to have been a rules light friendly introductory game and I think they've done it brilliantly.<br><br>I should add one issue I have with Doctor Who. The core dice mechanic of  'Attribute + Skill + Trait + 2d6 vs difficulty number' sounds vaguely intuitive. Its not. There is just too much number crunching there. They should have found a way to simplify this. <br/><br/>(Just to avoid any suggestions of bias I should point out that I have done play-testing for Cubicle-7 but prior to playing a Dr Who demo at IndieCon and then receiving it through the post last week I knew nothing about it)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246460/#Comment_246460" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T14:59:58+00:00" title="December 13, 2009  2:59PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff, Jonathan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat confirms my suspicion that much of what should have happened in the game (i.e. what I wanted out of it) could not due to timing and licenses.

To a certain extent, I think it's not insane to think: "Tabletop used to be much more popular than it is now, in terms of sheer numbers of participants; there must have been something to those old games," even though I think there have been huge social and market changes since the early decades that help explain a lot of that.  And as a designer, it's hard to not think: "What got me into this hobby in the first place? How can I make that happen for a new generation?" even though the new generation (assuming there will be one, which is a huge assumption in the first place) probably wants very different things.  So, yeah, not the decision I would have made and potentially an unfortunate one for the success of this particular game (we'll see!), but I can kinda see how Chris got there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246511/#Comment_246511" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T04:27:05+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  4:27AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Good stuff, Jonathan.<br><br>That confirms my suspicion that much of what should have happened in the game (i.e. what I wanted out of it) could not due to timing and licenses.

But it looks to me like they sacrificed a lot of depth and quality in order to get the game out by a specific deadline.  If the plan was, from the beginning, to only release levels 1-5 at first, then I don't see why they couldn't have waited longer for the CRPG to get further along in development.  This is especialy true for the setting content.  How much playtesting does that take?  <br/><br/>In light of the new information, the game smells even more of a rush-job-just-slap-it-together-hurry-we'll-fix-it-later trying to cash in on another game's big release.  I'm sure it will result in a handsome initial injection of cash for the company but the long term damage to the game will likely be fatal.  Wouldn't surprise me if they blow thru everything they make on the initial release before the third release comes out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246615/#Comment_246615" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T12:37:22+00:00" title="December 14, 2009 12:37PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2009 12:38PM by John_Powell.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow I sense a lot of... hate? dismissal? of this game by folks who haven't bother to play it.

The question then becomes one of criticising the business choices around how the license was structured, why so little information was obtainable up front, whether the game would have benefited from being released in 1Q 2010 if that meant more information would be available to incorporate into the design, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut since I have zero information to go on to talk intelligently about such things, I'll limit my comments to the design itself.  So I think the DESIGN would have benefited enormously from not being finished until the full information was available.  But the actual unit sales may (or perhaps not) have suffered tremendously.  But any comments I'd have on such would be pure POMA speculation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to summarize, then, I guess I'd say.  "There are parts of the design that are just flat out weak.  Some of those weak parts may well be not the fault of the designer designing a weak game but the fault of the business/license constraints that the designer was forced (chose?) to work within.  So to an extent the blame shifts up the chain a bit."  Although I have no inside knowledge on how involved Chris Pramas was at the higher level decisions too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246652/#Comment_246652" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T15:51:17+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  3:51PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Powell</cite>Wow I sense a lot of... hate? dismissal? of this game by folks who haven't bother to play it.

What I hate is the consistent nature of the mainstream RPG industry to march out licensed product after licenced product or retread of an old game after retread of an old game.  It's no different in Hollywood.  Cinema is dying.  For every Avatar we get twenty movies with the number 2 or 3  after the title or thirty pasctiche romantic comedies.  From the information I have (which is admittedly limited) it just seems this was a rush job to cash in on another game's big release rather than a serious attempt to make an eduring game that will last far longer than its electronic counterpart.

I dig the thorough review, but talk of "WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?!?!? WHO IS TO BLAME?!?!?" aren't all that helpful. The product will stand or it will fall, and it's a little weird to capitalize on either until one of them happens. Or to anticipate good/shitty sales when the thing just made its way out the door...<br/><br/>Great, thorough review though. I'm not so down on the conservative mechanics, but Ralph does a great job of summarizing them nonetheless. In fact, Ralph does a pretty phenomenal review method between this and Warhammer 3e: Thorough, detailed, biased, knows his audience. He didn't hit a sentence he didn't like and dismissed the whole product wholesale or anything like that: He dug and dug and dug to present all the qualities. Anyway, I hope we see more in the future. (also, I changed the category to "The Game Report" to reflect the review).<br/><br/>Video game emulation concerns aside (in terms of rules): You can't play a Grey Warden out of the box? Or a Noble (1) dwarf from Orzammar (2) (perhaps the most compelling and interesting of the intro scenarios of the game, even more than the female-city-elf one that I settled on)? Weak. Fucking.

In fact, such a grid would completely ruin the feel IMO since the nice thing about DA:O combat is how fluid it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou enter an encounter area, you pause the game to ascertain the threats.  Its a mix of Hurlocks and Genlocks, mostly white with a couple of yellows and a mage in the back.  There's two melee guys in the short distance to the right and two more in the short distance to the left.  In the mid distance there's an archer on either side and in the center a yellow melee guy with two more melee guys.  In the far distance is a yellow mage and a yellow melee guy in the center and another archer to each side.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so I send my tank and support melee guy up the middle to engage the yellow melee guy.  The amount of time it takes him to get there is so minimal that to have to count it out on a grid would be irritating at best.  I'd just say "an unengaged guy can move 2 range bands to engage an enemy" and leave it at that.  The 3 center guys all start hitting on my tank to little effect.  My archer and mage start throwing ranged fire at the enemy mage, my archer using the suppressive action to deplete his casting.  The melee guys on the near flanks probably start to rush my archer and mage.  I wait until they get close, then I have my tank throw down a Taunt.  The flanker dudes turn and rush to beat on my tank instead, again they get there almost immediately so to have to move on a grid seems unnecessary.  Meanwhile I have my support fighter trigger Threaten so he can peel the heavy hitting yellow dude off my tank.  My mage goes through the first (maybe second) round of heals for my fighters.  After the yellow guy in the center goes down (possibly with some help from my mage if its taking too long) the two fighters focus attacks on each of the white melee guys in turn taking each down pretty quickly.  Somewhere in here we pop a couple of Warcries to knock everyone down and stun them or a Rally or Berserk power to get bonuses, and, of course, a slew of sheild bashes, pummels, assaults, and overbears (all powers that can be activated manually or on automatic triggers you get to set). Its likely that another couple of rounds of healing are necessary during this.  At all times this is just a knot of guys in the center of the screen wailing on each other and trying to pop powers to stun and knock down the baddies before they stun and knock down you.  The enemy mage is probably at 2/3 to 3/4 strength depending on how much the mage got to shoot at him vs. healing or helping take down the melee guys.  But between the suppressive fire (which has probably run out due to depleted stamina) and having to heal himself he ideally hasn't had time to cast to many nasty spells (like Winter's Embrace that not only does damage but freezes you to get beat on by the melee guys or that nasty pain chamber one).  After the melee guys are done, the tanks rush the mage, finish him off, then its mopping up the rest.  Rushing the mage takes very little time, and there aren't really any zones of control in the game.  If a melee guy tries to intercept you just pretty much keep going and he winds up getting maybe a free swing (no biggie) and then chasing you until you stop moving, which usually will be the next time you engage in a melee...which forms another little knot of dudes wailing on each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a rogue with back stab you add some flitting about from one opponent to another, maybe running between knots of guys to dish out your back stab damage, but still the moving about is a non issue.  There is a Combat Move ability but what it does is increase the angle at which your back stab can land (i.e. makes the target have a bigger flank).  It doesn't actually make moving about any easier...because moving about is already so easy its not a thing that needs to be managed.  In practice if one of the above melee guys rushed my mage, and did not respond to my tank's taunt, I could peel my support melee guy off, send him to the rear to kill the lone baddie, who likely only got 2 maybe 3 swings (to minimal effect) on the mage before he turns to face the melee guy, kill that guy, and then run back to the main melee with my tank...all so quickly that on the table top I'd be inclined to just teleport him from engagement to engagement.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn occasion there are some choke points to deal with or some traps that you might trigger if you go rushing around, but those are easily dealt with with mechanics other than a grid and minis I'd say.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the above is an illustration of what combat feels like in the PC game...and what IMO it should have been designed to feel like in the RPG.  LOTS of potential for fun tactical choices, but no need I can see for moving around with minis measuring inches of movement rates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246801/#Comment_246801" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T09:40:22+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  9:40AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2009 9:40AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like a pretty bog-standard adaptation to me, which to me fits because I found Dragon Age to be a pretty bog-standard action-RPG. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246803/#Comment_246803" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T09:53:00+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  9:53AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The grid thing is a straw man.

Also I agree that Rob's review is pretty solid as well.<br><br><br>===<br><br>This is neither here nor there, but about two nights ago on my PS3 I put the game <i>out of its misery</i>. That is to say, I finished it with something like 25 hours of total play (not counting an extra hour or two to go through a bunch of the opening scenarios). My OCD need to be completist and follow the game to its end completely hijacked the absolute boredom I had going through about 90% of the game, including two times about 60% through the game when I decided that I was bored enough to quit, only to later read gamefaqs and find out that I had stopped right before a particularly interesting boss fight. <br><br>The only parts I really liked were the intro scenario (I stuck with female city elf, but several of them were cool), some bits about the Fade, the Orzammar parts (cool adaptation of a self-important caste system that you can really feel by playing the game), the Grey Warden Comprehensive Entrance Examination, and the final send-off where at the final climax of the game you get to high-five your party and talk about what they will do next. I found everything else, in all of the game's entirety, to be boring, bland, derivative and done-to-death (from pretty much every single character interaction, every sidequest, every single portion of the main quest, every bit of Fetching A to Help NPC B, every note, every journal entry, every world codex). <br><br>The only NPCs I ever cared about more than a tinkle were Shianni (?) the Elf Chick I Wanted To Have My Character Make Out With but Couldn't, King Blonde Guy, and Poison Mage Guy In Prison. The only characters in my party I liked were Chantry Chick (I had a hard time remembering her name because it was so similar to the name of the character I made up kinda randomly, so it was hard to tell them apart at times) and my War Hound: Everyone else was forgettable (I never once used the elderly mage lady or drunk dwarf) or a dope/dick. All the crafting was boring, most of the fighting was repetitive other than the boss battles, and the majestic scenery wasn't all that majestic (After seeing all sorts of cool fantasy landscapes in Morrowind, I was expecting more: Instead, we get pretty scenes of what could otherwise be New Jersey, but with a stone tower here or there). All in all, I think the game was totally overhyped, was expecting something far more fantastic.<br/><br/>To its credit, the CONCEPT ART for the game, as well as the FMV animation previews (the party attacks a dragon in the snow) was TOTALLY BADASS. I have no idea what happened between that and the game, though: I think most of the vibrant-ness of the art must have washed out into a dull grey as it was translated into the game. Like how Yoshitaka Amano's character sketches for games like FFVI (FF4 in the US) turned into 8-bit sprites. But the Green Ronin game has a lot of that art, it seems, so that gives it the edge in my opinion.<br/><br/>The music was cool, save for the emo rap-rock at the end credits (as soon as the credits rolled I was in the kitchen, washing dishes). I plan on selling my copy as soon as humanly possible.<br/><br/>===<br/><br/>Anyway, I shared the above not to be a dick but to make a point: Some people here seem to LOVE the setting behind Dragon Age, but don't like the mechanics. While everyone's got their opinions and all, I wanted to demonstrate that, as Walker P points out above, innovation isn't the end-all: Because I personally found the world of Dragon Age (the setting) about as innovative as every homebrew setting you've ever designed for AD&amp;D back in Junior High School, but with more writers and better art. So while I am reading about the lack of innovation in the mechanics and nodding silently along, I don't jump to the conclusion of "...therefore it's bad." It might not be my cuppa, and it doesn't seem to emulate the more interesting parts of the CRPG (Grey Wardens and Nobles and Dwarves out-of-the-box), I don't begrudge their stated goals of "old school but new again".<br/><br/>Time will tell if it puts butts in chairs. Even if it brings in dozens/hundreds of gamers who like the console game, who end up never venturing outside of the confines of the Dragon Age RPG, I still say that counts for somethin'.

The best of it centered around magic and the fade (the dream world that was the source of magic and the home of demons), the consequences of that element in the game were amazing on the world and your character.  Then there's the choice of who to support among the dwarves, what to do in Redcliffe and how to resolve the Elven situations.  That's something I havent seen in a CRPG before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weak parts of the game were the combat and character building.  Guessing which spell or ability to take was rather hit or miss, some were really effective others seemed like a waste of the pick.  The combat wasnt necessarily bad or anything but it was very video gamish, fighting through hordes of enemies over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me the strengths of this game match well with many indie games much more than it does with an old schoolish retro style gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nedited to add.  I've heard that playing on a platform compared to the PC makes a big difference as well.  The battles arent nearly as difficult on the platforms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246977/#Comment_246977" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T18:24:12+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  6:24PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, the setting is pretty much the unholy lovechild of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones--which I enjoy very much <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  But so far it's nothing more extraordinary than that.<br><br>A couple of nights ago, I lay in bed reconsidering a choice my character made.

The very nature of old school design puts a tremendous level of responsibility on players that IMO harms accessibility.  Just because the books are thin doesn't mean the act of play is easy.  Put yourself in the shoes of someone who's never table topped before but is a fan of the PC game.  How many such people are going to be able to GM an old school game successfully.  I mean the GMs job in an old school game is 1 part novelist, 1 part entertainer, and 1 part game designer.  I can't see how that can be considered "accessible".  Now take a look at it from the players perspective.  Old school play is like a sandbox of possibilities.  Playing Dragon Age on the PC is like watching a semi interactive movie.  There are flags hovering over people's heads telling you who to talk to, and dialog trees that you can follow to get the next clue.  You can click on your "Journal" and it will tell you the next thing you need to do to progress in any one of your active quests.  Now put that player in a sand box and tell him he can do "anything".<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah maybe a few players will have an OMG epiphany moment.  But I think far more will have an OMG how-the-hell-do-you-play-this-thing moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOld school design only seems accessible to us grognards. To anyone else its bizarre, alien, and largely unfathomable.  It hard to think of a WORSE way to introduce new players to role-playing...except maybe some of the Ueber Crunch fetish designs<br/>\n<br/>\n.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247559/#Comment_247559" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T17:03:20+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  5:03PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno.

Especially since entertainment media nowadays is inundated with the tropes of a trad rpg (hit points, etc).  <br><br>I do agree that the "sandbox of possibilities" is not an easy thing to grasp, and it's certainly not the most accessible approach.

I quit the game in boredom about 10 hours in. <br><br>It occurs to me that much of the joy of Dragon Age was lost on me because of my relationship to computer RPGs. A lot of folks seem to like Dragon Age in marked contrast to Elder Scrolls or WarCraft or one of the other anime-esque/baroque CRPGs that have dominated the market in recent years. Have a serious fantasy game with modern graphics and game play, but minus living in giant mushrooms, elves with four foot long ears, or big eyed anime girls seems pretty exciting when the dominant games on the market have large servings of all that. <br><br>But me, I haven't been playing those games. I haven't played CRPGs for years, and so when I got Dragon Age it really just seemed like a prettier version of a lot of the games I used to play. And while I'm sure there are some interesting stories and characters in there, they weren't there soon enough or with enough craft to make me give a crap. <br/><br/>My reaction to the TTRPG was, perhaps not shockingly, almost exactly the same.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247599/#Comment_247599" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-19T11:37:35+00:00" title="December 19, 2009 11:37AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2009 11:38AM by Brian_Minter.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Old school design only seems accessible to us grognards.

I mean, you can't play the actual video game without either developing skills in video games in general or stumbling around making mistakes and developing those skills, right? Didn't we stumble when we learned tag, chess, football, D&amp;D, Dogs in the Vineyard, and how to act on a date? Why not this? People stumble in Penny For My Thoughts and reading the instructions is <i>part of that game.</i>  Everyone screws up all the time forever.

It's just a skill, that's all, you start with none of it, you follow the directions as best you can, making some mistakes, you learn from others, you learn from reading, you learn from life, you grow, you gain some modest degree of mastery, then go on the internet and everyone screams that what you've done is a horrible mistake and a waste of time and if they had <i>their</i> way, nobody would ever value what you value again.  Thus the circle of life continues.  Mistakes, growth, aspirations, wonder, and the internet destroying it all, squatting in the center like Kali with rabies. <br/><br/>I bear a warning. The next generation will look at narration passing (or Your Favorite Mechanic) as the symptom of horrific weakness. They will disdain it. They will sneer at it. "Oh, look at those narration passing story games." they will say, sniffing haughtily, on the superInternet messageboards. "Aren't they amusingly primitive? And the fools who worked very hard to get good at narration, and passing things along and, what did they call them? 'Bangs'? Oh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, it's not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just completely terrible design in every way and everyone knows it forever, I hope I never see anything like that again."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247710/#Comment_247710" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T00:03:26+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 12:03AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2009 12:25AM by Alex.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>I really wish this game had stronger support for new players. I just can't get past the "Grey Warden" thing.<br/><br/>I think an effective intro game absolutely needs to simplify not only the mechanical setup but the narrative stuff, too -- lay out a clear reason for the characters to be involved with each other and give them something to work towards. In the context of traditional RPG-party tropes, the Grey Wardens are absolutely perfect for this: people of diverse skillsets and backgrounds, usually acting in small groups, trying to accomplish some kind of really big, important goal. And, importantly, being a Grey Warden also demands that you distance yourself a bit from your old life, which totally frees you up to have characters like nobles and Circle mages and escaped slaves and assassins without messing up the wandering-adventurer dynamic by introducing holdings, servants, superiors, solo side jobs, &amp;c.<br/><br/>The whole "Grey Warden" shtick is something obviously designed to be the glue that holds the Dragon Age setting together. I don't understand why the designer would want to pass that up.<br/><br/>Does the tabletop game have something else that can "fill in" for the Grey Wardens as the unifying premise?<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247713/#Comment_247713" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T00:47:12+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 12:47AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11153" rel="nofollow">GM FIat and Fudging conversation continued in this thread over yonder.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247818/#Comment_247818" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T10:40:49+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 10:40AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any reason to think that the DA math does tend to lead to wonky fudge-necessitating outcomes?

I haven't played the CRPG, but I'm not sure how relevant that is. There are certain things CRPGs do very well that a TTRPG just plain can't do. It's far better to emphasise the things which a TTRPG is good at, and skirt around the strengths of a CRPG.<br/><br/>With regards to not being able to start as nobles - the default setting of Ferelden has nobility and rank based on fighting prowess. If you're level 1, you're not going to be high rank - that'll come after a few adventures when you've proven yourself as a worthy fighter. The whole set up struck me as rather well designed.<br/><br/>As for the mechanics, they're close enough to d20 that most people wouldn't be confused by it. I liked that having a flat +2 for skills is far better than anything more detailed. 4e and SWSE went that direction, I see no reason to make it more complicated. The degree of success system does have some wonky math, but it's better to have wonky math than something complicated. The stunt die system I think is also quite smart. Playing 4e gets tedious because you're always making a choice each round. Having it only come up once in a while means play won't get bogged down.<br/><br/>While the system is simple, that simplicity lends itself to some good playtesting, and the design definitely reflects taking into account problems that make gameplay unpleasant in other systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263303/#Comment_263303" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T23:15:26+00:00" title="March 21, 2010 11:15PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>As for the mechanics, they're close enough to d20 that most people wouldn't be confused by it.</blockquote>\nDo you mean, "<i>people new to rpgs</i>* won't get confused by it because d20 is simple" or "rpg gamers won't get confused by it because they know d20"?

Rehash fantasy settings are fun in a tabletop when my group and I can inject my own awesome influence into the proceedings but they are total crap in a video game.

Sprinkle on transparent pseudo-ethical choices (Should my character kill and eat babies... or start an orphanage?) and you have 10 years of Bioware.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Read the Rob Donoghue review, and I basically agree with it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263326/#Comment_263326" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T04:05:29+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  4:05AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">With regards to not being able to start as nobles - the default setting of Ferelden has nobility and rank based on fighting prowess.

But if you go with the assumption that people who want to play the TTRPG are doing so because they want to further explore a lot of the cool stuff from the video games (being a Grey Warden, playing the nobility, going past level 5 [which is usually accomplished during the Origin phase]), which is a pretty safe assumption, then it's not unlikely that they're going to be disappointed. Some who played the video game will want to play out the stuff you *couldn't* do in the video game, and it's possible that they'll be just fine with the initial offering.

Of course, 1-3 and 4-14 was a better split - you figure out the system, then you get everything else, but still covering just some basic stuff that's internally consistent in set 1, so you get the rules, and then introducing the other stuff makes more sense, than introducing everything at once and being incomplete in some aspects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263411/#Comment_263411" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T10:53:30+00:00" title="March 22, 2010 10:53AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, look at it this way. Computer RPG players are used to being able to get started right away, and learn as they go. Even through an intro quest that doesn't have much to do with the main quest. Keeping things simple and straightforward is the way to go. Keep the rulebooks small, so that you can get started quicker. Computer RPG players are also used to buying expansions. Having a set 1, and following with sets 2, 3 and 4 would seem perfectly natural to them. Pick a gaming convention that's well understood, similar to CRPGs in some ways, but still different, that's known to be fast and you'll hit the spot better than going for something that's overly complicated. The first time you play D&amp;D you're thinking it's cool that you can play an Elf, not worrying that you can't be a Gnome Paladin. The desire for more options and depth comes after playing for a while, but the systems that develop as a result make the hobby walled in. Going back to the roots, with similarities to the system that got (most) everyone into the hobby makes a lot of sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263437/#Comment_263437" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T11:44:56+00:00" title="March 22, 2010 11:44AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2010 11:45AM by Cedric P.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Imagine trying to do Oblivion as a TTRPG.

Range would be one of those things, rate of attacks, how much money you have, how much you can carry, wounds and their associated penalties, whether you have necessary components to cast spells. I've seen people playing RPGs with a binder where they flip back and forth through multiple pages that are all one character sheet to keep track of what they're doing. That's going to a lot of work, and a computer still does it all better. <br/><br/>Speaking of a Final Fantasy RPG, the one thing a TTRPG can't do well is the 5-6 digit damage totals per hit. Equipment is a bit easier with it being slots (depending on the game) instead of an encumbrance system. It's somewhat the same for wargames. You can play a strategy game that simulates fatigue, morale on an individual level, physics with wind. There's no way Warhammer or anything like that can compete - all Warhammer really has is the tactile feel and the fun of painting your miniatures. And D&amp;D on an official level robs you of that by pre-painting the minis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263479/#Comment_263479" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T14:06:19+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  2:06PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2010 2:06PM by Tulpa.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>RE: things computers do better.<br/>\nWithin Dragon Age specifically, a lot of stats are listed as fractional percentages.

Regardless of the bioware game, none of the choices are ever really challenging or delve into grey areas of morality. I can't think of any situation where there wasn't a blatant goody two shoes right answer without any sort of consequences. Let's break down the choices and consequences of the example you chose Vernon:</p>\n<p>(1) Kill the kid, this is right out as the obviously evil choice. The kid didn't do anything wrong, he was just born with magic and his mom fucked up by keeping it a secret. I don't know the consequences to this one but I'm guessing all that'll happen is Alistair will whine at you for fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p>(2) Kill the mom, this is the mercenary impatient option. She volunteered herself and admitted guilt to her actions. Alistair whines at you for fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p>(3) Save everyone and make everyone happy. No consequences! You know how it will turn out because you have just defended the town from attack and taken back the castle. What can happen? The same thing again? You already dealt with that.</p>\n<p>The problem: I have played Bioware games before. I have come to expect these set up choices where they try to push poor options on you before giving you the good option. Along every step of the conversation you can say "But there has to be another way~~" and lo there is because bioware can't sell making difficult decisions, but they can sell populist games that appeal to the illusion of difficult choices, recycling the same dilemmas and structures in every single game.</p>\n<p>As for a few counterpoints to "I'm saying it was very much an ethical choice and the deepest ethical choice you'll get in a CRPG.": The first two Fallout games, Arcanum, Planescape: Torment, Deus Ex, I suppose Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines but that imported the lame morality slider from the tabletop games.</p>\n<p>I can give specific examples in all of these games if you want.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263501/#Comment_263501" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T15:20:32+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  3:20PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Speaking of a Final Fantasy RPG, the one thing a TTRPG can't do well is the 5-6 digit damage totals per hit.</blockquote>\nYep, but look at Super Console, the game manage to emulate the mega digit damage and mana points in a nice way by using percentiles bars. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>RE: things computers do better.

I imagined what it'd be like to be the human noble who says "You know what? Fuck the treaties. I'm going to find my brother." DA:O is fun. I really, really enjoy the origin sequences.

Tulpa</cite>The problem: I have played Bioware games before. I have come to expect these set up choices where they try to push poor options on you before giving you the good option. Along every step of the conversation you can say "But there has to be another way~~" and lo there is because bioware can't sell making difficult decisions, but they can sell populist games that appeal to the illusion of difficult choices, recycling the same dilemmas and structures in every single game.</blockquote>\nAlthough they did a bang-up job with Orzammar -- there's a genuinely difficult decision there, two of them in fact.  Choosing between Bhelen and Harrowmount seems clear-cut enough, but when you get to the end of the game it turns out that it wasn't so clear-cut after all, and I'm still not sure how I feel about that choice when I go back and replay it.  Likewise, while it looks like you have a standard Bioware not-actually-difficult choice when you get to Branka, they put some teeth into it; one option is not decidedly superior to the other, and you could justify your choice either way pretty easily.<br/><br/>There's just a lot of good shit going on in Orzammar, especially if you include the two dwarf origin stories.  Seriously, whoever wrote that material could've worked at Black Isle Studios, that's how good it is.<br/><br/>(edited for mild spoilers)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263522/#Comment_263522" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T16:47:48+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  4:47PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robin,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think our differing bases of talk are making it very, very difficult to communicate.

Some people just don't want to read through that much. The 64 page count of the DA books make them easily readable in one sitting. If it has that huge amount of information, you'll have players deciding to give up if they have to spend that much time just reading the rules before they get to play. DA has limited options, it's set in Ferelden, gives you a few classes and some background options. You roll your stats, swap one, roll modifiers based on background and move on. Starting a character isn't hard - you trade quick and easy for complete with every option. That's better if you want to bring new people into the hobby. A full game detailing all of Thedas with every character option would only be appealing to existing TTRPG players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263525/#Comment_263525" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T16:57:40+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  4:57PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But starting as a noble has nothing to do with numbers... o.O<br><br>The problem here is TTRPG baggage.

By only looking at character generation, you're looking at a small piece of the picture. Oblivion has easy character generation, but the underlying system is a nightmare to figure out. Ease of character generation in a CRPG says nothing about its appropriateness or applicability to a TTRPG.<br><br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>For a game set to follow a computer game, you HAVE to allow the players to make the types of characters they can make in the computer game. So, yes. It's pretty much ALL about the characters.</blockquote>\nNo. For a game designed to introduce new players to the hobby, you have to keep things simple. Dragon Age keeps things simple. Ferelden, due to not having slavery is more recognisable than the rest of Thedas. You're not stuck with having to learn a new setting and social structure along with new rules. The Grey Wardens were exiled from Ferelden, you're not going to play one from Ferelden or in Ferelden. Expanding the scope of the set to include more of the world to actually support Grey Wardens would be a bad idea, as it would increase the page count, and leave a good chunk of it incomplete. Ferelden as presented is complete. Nothing else is really described, but you've got a complete and internally consistent location to adventure in. In Ferelden, the nobility is based on fighting prowess. If you start out with noble level fighting ability, you're at the top of the starting levels. That doesn't do any good because the advantage of leveling up is it allows you to gradually learn the system. Including Grey Wardens and Starting Nobles in Ferelden would make for a bad game, as it would stop making any sense.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Go play the computer game.

But as the CRPG is about an exception, why force this historical quirk (which probably was included in the CRPG only so the protagonist wouldn't have a jolly band of Wardens he could call upon to smite the monsters) as an argument to disallow the class which is the CRPG is about?<br>\n<br>\nTo me it just seems like a strategy to bait buyers into also buying the next book. And that it was a bad design-decision. And that the TTRPG is a worse product because of it. And that annoys me. Because if they wanted players to be able to play awesome G-Wards of the bat,  it wouldn't be hard to find a reason to include them. Maybe the age in which it's set Wardens could be common in Ferelden?

They know many of us roleplay so they bought the TTRPG. <br><br>They were baffled that they couldn't play Wardens. This issue is further complicated by the fact that they want everything Dragon Age and bought the novels. The 2nd novel is doing really, really well. It's selling around 45-50 copies a week on amazon. They bought this before buying the RPG. Which I suspect exacerbated the problem. The 2nd novel is about: <br><br>"A King guides a motley crew of Grey Wardens through the treacherous Deep Roads to help them find a missing Grey Warden." <br><br>This novel is selling twice as much as the previous novel which doesn't feature Wardens. I'm sure that isn't the only reason. But the way my friends go on and on about this issue makes me think it is a significant factor. <br><br>Granted I believe the novel covers a different location and time period than the RPG (and the computer RPG). But my friends don't care about those sort of technical details. I'm sure there are lots of valid and well thought out reasons for the decisions behind all these products. But after playing Wardens in the CRPG, reading a whole book about them, all they want to do is play them in the TTRPG. And just like the video game, a lot of people want to play the exception, not the rule. They aren't going to spend time thinking about the good reasons they weren't included. <br><br>I feel for the situation.

This isn't intended to be a declaration of hatred, and I don't intend to hold this against you in other discussions. However, you refuse to listen to anything that disagrees with you, and only pick at nits to support your points. You refuse to get the proper ground-level knowledge to discuss the reasons why this release is flawed. We no longer have any basis to discuss this topic. Oh, and yes, I knew the Wardens had been exiled. You learn that during the game intro. We're past that now, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you've managed to express what I have been trying to say much better than I have. It's about moving from game, to expectation, to wish fulfillment. The designers apparently had something different in mind about the expectations, and therefore have failed to properly fulfill the wishes. This doesn't make the game bad, but it certainly does make the game disappointing. As I said upthread, as soon as I realized there was a TTRPG, I started thinking about the opportunities for play that I couldn't get with an on-the-rails computer game, and those opportunities definitely involved Grey Wardens.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've also piqued my interest in the associated novel. It sounds like the story that's mentioned, where Maric went off with the Grey Wardens, and thereafter lifted the exile. I'd been hoping to hear more about that over the course of the game, but now it sounds like that tidbit was a hook to hang a novel on. Shameless commercialization, which I am perfectly okay with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263678/#Comment_263678" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T09:29:50+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  9:29AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kapsberger</cite>To me it just seems like a strategy to bait buyers into also buying the next book.

In the game, you have to get all this info by browsing around quest logs and informational notices scattered across several dozen menus. In this book, it's all in one place.

I've actually read the game from cover to cover (or rather, page 1 to 66 on both files), so to suggest I'm not qualified to talk about it is a bit bizarre. Certainly playing the CRPG is of value, but it's by no means a pre-requisite, and certainly not moreso than reading the TTRPG. I wouldn't suggest that anyone needs to read the TTRPG to talk about it either, but in terms of importance, the TTRPG is what we're actually talking about so it trumps playing the CRPG as far as being qualified to speak on the topic goes. <br><br>I don't have a problem with the notion that some of the decisions may have been <i>bad</i> - while I don't agree with that, it's a matter of opinion and is a defensible standpoint. The notion that the decisions were poorly thought out isn't defensible. For every gripe anyone has about the TTRPG, there's a good explanation for it, and all the components integrate very nicely. If you haven't played the CRPG, there's no sign that anything is missing, and if you've got experience with a variety of rules and presentations in RPGs, you can tell that it was put together with a lot of deliberation and purpose. Saying it was poorly thought out is straight up false.<br><br>We can use an essay analogy here. You can have a very well written essay, and in a vacuum, anyone reading it would likely be quite pleased with it. If however that essay were an assignment for a University class, and the essay weren't on topic, it would receive a poor grade, but that poor grade would only be for being off topic, not on the grounds of it being poorly written. Any professor familiar with the general subject matter could say whether it's well written or not. Someone in the class could tell whether it was on topic or not.<br><br>That's the problem here, people are confusing on topic with well written. And some people are only familiar with the topic, and haven't actually read through it, and are unfortunately making judgements on both counts, while they're only qualified to make (some) judgements on one count. I'm getting my hands on the CRPG soon enough, so I'll be able to formulate my own opinion on how well the TTRPG nails it, but that's not something I need to do to be able to say how well thought out and designed the TTRPG is - that's evident from the start.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263772/#Comment_263772" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T17:01:47+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  5:01PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2010 5:05PM by Valamir.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Hello pot, meet the kettle.

I've got well over 100 hours in the CRPG and have read both TTRPG files quite thoroughly more than once.

Otherwise, leave me out of your rantings and ravings.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think trying to offer an opinion on a licensed product where you have absolutely zero knowledge of the license is rather questionable.  You can't claim the game is well designed and well thought out unless you can judge how well it depicts the licensed property it is tied to.  Until you've actually played through the full CRPG, you really have insufficient information to go on and should probably have reserved the bulk of your comments until you actually...have a clue what you're talking about...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263779/#Comment_263779" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T17:34:35+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  5:34PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, you asked for it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><strong></strong>The game is designed to be incomplete.  The box set currently available is "Set 1" the book refers to Sets 2, 3, and 4 being on the way (though it doesn't indicate what those are).  Why is this disappointing rather than merely annoying?  Well because the rules for playing Gray Wardens...not included in Set 1.  Yup that's right.  The whole point to the PC game...not included in the TTRPG.  Further, while the characters can level all the way up to 20, much like the old D&amp;D box sets, only levels 1-5 are included in Set 1.  I suspect they'll be doled out 5 levels per set requiring a ton of book hunting and flipping to find the level information you're looking for.</blockquote>\nIt indicates what you'll find in Set 2 - Grey Wardens. That addresses 2 of your concerns in one.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><strong>Disappointing Thing #3:</strong>Not only can you not play a Gray Warden, you are specifically forbidden from playing nobility...even the lowest rung of nobility, the knight.  Yep...the rules are quite clear...you must "earn the right" to play a nobleman or Gray Warden .</blockquote>\nYou didn't read the background info on Ferelden, if this doesn't make sense to you.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I still can't fathom that design decision.</blockquote>\nTime to read through it one more time. This time thoroughly.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><strong>Disappointing Thing #4:</strong>Some of the most boring dice mechanics of recent years.  So here's the system.  Roll 3d6 add them up.  Then add your attribute (-2 to 4).  Then, if you have an appropriate focus +2 (yeah...there are skills...but the skills don't have levels...its just a flat +2 for having it).  Roll against a GM set target number.  Here's the big twist...one of the d6 is a different color (the Dragon Die), and the number rolled on that die is the degree of success.  Also, if you happen to roll doubles then the number on the Dragon Die gives you "stunt points" to do extra tricks with.  Kinda cool, but that means all the fun stuff you might want to do (like mighty blows, or duel weapons strikes) you can only do if you randomly roll enough stunt points.  That's it.  Quick, easy, functional...but hardly state of the art.</blockquote>\nYou really want difficult dice mechanics for an intro RPG? Simple mechanics - the likes of BD&amp;D and Traveller are what got people into the hobby in the first place.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br><strong>Disappointing Thing #5:</strong>Ok...so an average attribute is 1.  A good starting attribute is 2.  And if you're a warrior you'll probably have a focus in your preferred weapon group.  So you're rolling 3d6+4.  The typical opponent has a defense (target number) of 12-15.  Which means at 1st level your dedicated warrior has an 83% chance of hitting the weaniest creature in the bestiary but only a 50% chance of hitting one of the tougher ones.  A less fighty character (say with only 3d6+2) the chance is 62% to 26%.  Thing is...as you level up...you really don't get much better.  Since the skills have no levels, the only way to improve is increase your stats.   By 5th level you can only improve a stat by 2 points, but more likely you'll spread that around more.  After that...there is no improving your chance to hit that I saw.   Typical damage is 2d6+2 while most monsters have 16-22 HPs so you need to hit 2-3 times to kill a creature.  That's like 3-6 attacks to put an opponent down.  Pretty bog standard make initiative roll, make to-hit roll, roll for damage stuff.  The only excitement comes from maybe, once in a while, rolling enough random stunt points to do something else besides say "I attack...again"</br></blockquote>\nFunny that you're complaining about this while later on you mention that in the game you hit 85% of the time. 83% nails that pretty well. Also, in a computer game you often make multiple standard attacks before doing anything interesting, unless you're continually pausing. It's not too different from waiting for Limit Breaks or Overdrives in Final Fantasy, and beats combat slowing to a crawl the way it does in 4e which gives you more options than just "I attack".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br><strong>Disappointing Thing #6:</strong>Ranges, special moves, and the like are all given in yards.  So no abstract, creative, or clever positioning mechanics going on here.  More bog standard moving minis around on a map and measuring distances.</br></blockquote>\nTotal failure to read the books. It addresses this specifically, and you're just plain wrong.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br>Skills as yes or no toggles seemed nifty to me too, when I was reading the character creation rules.  But when you do the math its really annoying.  First, any fixed add on a summed die pool has completely different effects depending on where the difficulty is set.</br></blockquote>\nThat's a trade off with bell curves. It keeps the results more consistent, and you're thinking about it wrong, the modifier moves the tip of the bell curve.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Second it means that even though the characters are expected to grind through 20 levels...they never really get actually better at anything.</blockquote>\nImprovement is an illusion in other games - the difficulty scales up with your capability, the odds never really change.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>They'll get better at more different things...but once they buy a +2...that's it.  Third...from a character perspective it means all trained swordsmen are equally good...there's no variety.  There's no phenomenal master swordsman.  Once you're trained you're the same as everyone else...that strikes me a profoundly uninteresting.</blockquote>\nYou don't know this, you've only seen the first five levels. Reviewing without reading thoroughly is one thing. Reviewing products which haven't been released is an entirely different low.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>barely.  And just because RPG setting books have a tradition of suck, doesn't mean we can't set the bar higher.  There are plenty of ways to deliver setting in an RPG book that would have been superior to the way it was done.</blockquote>\nThe problem is you were expecting all of Thedas and it gave you Ferelden. It's your expectations that are the problem, not the setting, which is presented very well, and has a lot of strengths. Of course, you didn't read through it thoroughly so you missed how all the pieces fit together.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br>Instead what I get is no ability to play nobles, no ability to play dwarves from Orzammar, no interesting Origin stories already laid out for me (or even a place where I get to create my own), No Grey Wardens, characters who attack once per 15 seconds of fictional time and once per 2-3 minutes of real time, hit only 1/2 the time with no ability to choose my special attacks at all unless I get a lucky roll.</br></blockquote>\nHaving Origin stories would seriously increase the page count and would seriously bog down character generation time. Not a good goal. Why would you play a dwarf from Orzammar when you're in Ferelden? Why would you play a Grey Warden when you're in Ferelden. Again, your expectations are more of a problem, once you saw it was set in Ferelden you should have looked at what it has to offer, rather than complaining about it not having what it quite logically wouldn't have.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>If this was to be a gateway RPG for the PC gamers than design goal numero Uno should have been to capture the experience of the PC game.  The game should have started you out with the characters from the PC game as sample characters, the character creation rules should have looked similar to that of the PC game, the players should have started as heroes not as scrubs and the mechanics should have been fast playing yes...but also interesting and able to be manipulated in fun ways.  As a gateway game...IMO  Epic Fail.</blockquote>\nCompletely wrong. The number one goal is to make it a quick and concise read, make character generation easy and the mechanics simple. If you fail at that, you have nothing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>If I were designing this game I would have gone back to the last Blight so as not to trample on the subsequent PC titles,</blockquote>\nWow, only 9 pages in, and you're already skimming. If they set it in the last Blight they couldn't call it Dragon Age. It would have to be called Exalted Age, and that'd make for some unnecessary confusion in the TTRPG market.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Why not one roll that tells you not IF you hit.  But instead, how many times you hit</blockquote>\nBecause then you'd have the monsters doing the same, and character death would be quick and frequent.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>In the PC game one of the most important Tank powers is Taunt...which gets the baddies to focus on your tough guy instead of your mage.  So hey a focus that lets the player take one of the monsters the GM was allocating and make it attack him instead</blockquote>\nYeah, a TTRPG already did that. D&amp;D4e. It's not newbie friendly.<br><br>All you're doing is complaining about it being different, there are several points that quite clearly tell that you didn't read through the whole thing thoroughly, and just skimmed through it looking for the parts that covered what you wanted to play instead of reading through it to see what it actually offers.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263781/#Comment_263781" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T17:35:41+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  5:35PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Ralph, to be fair, the setting is by far the least interesting part of the CRPG to me, so I didn't really have any complaints about the tabletop for not being 1-to-1 with the licensed setting.</p>\n<p>Does there need to be rules for playing a Grey Warden, if you've already played the CRPG?</p>\n<p>Think about it.

Seriously?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire point to playing the CRPG is to play a Gray Warden.  If you can't see how making players wait for a supplement to allow them to do the only thing in the game worth doing is a questionable decision then I can't help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are apparently unware that large chunks of the background provided in the TTRPG directly contradicts the background presented in the CRPG.  If you'd asked when the thread was new I could have quoted you paragraphs and pages, it's been too long now but when you finally actually play the crpg perhaps you'll pay close enough attention to the background to discover that for yourself.  As for having to "earn the right" to play a noble.  I started first level as a noble.  Before my character had done anything significant he was a noble.  If I can start as a noble right off the bat in the CRPG I should be able to start as a noble right off the bat in the TTRPG.  Again, if you can't see the logic in that...I can't help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for "difficult" mechanics.  If you can't see how you can make mechanics that aren't bland, boring, and completely devoid of flavor (specifically the flavor of the CRPG) without being difficult, then perhaps you haven't played very many games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the odds, my character maintained an 83-88% hit percentage through the entire game including while fighting monsters of much higher level.  As the party tank, I was typically taking on the more powerful monsters, leaving the easy kills to others.  In the TTRPG you only get a hit percentage that high fighting the weak monsters and quickly drop down from there.  Which I explained in the very text you quoted, but apparently you were in too much of a rush to disagree with me to read it closely.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you start telling me things I'm wrong about.  I think not.  Ranges for all missile weapons are given in yards.  Not range bands or abstractions like close or far...but yards.  In the CRPG the range is all but irrelevant.  Rare is the occassion where you can't hit any monster on the screen from anywhere on the screen you have a line of sight from.  Getting the line of sight is far more important than range.  Yet the game measures everything in yards.  An absolutely unhelpful unit of measure unless you're using minis and a map marked to scale.  If not, if you're just using your imagination, there are more helpful ways to treat range.   Plain wrong?  Who is failing to read the text.  Do you find any clever positioning mechanics?  No?  I believe that's what I said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you're going to try to tell me what my expectations are...that I was expecting all of Thedas...perhaps you're not aware that the entire CRPG is set in Ferelden...which is also where the entrance to Orzammar is...in Ferelden.  Oh right...you're not aware of that...cuz you haven't played the game.  Is it starting to sink in how little you understand even the fundamentals of what you're talking about yet?  You who haven't played the CRPG at all are going to try to correct me when I explain how the TTRPG is a poor fit and a mediocre adaptation of the CRPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nSerioulsy Migo...don't bother to respond until you've actually played the game.  Bottom line is this...a licensed product that does a poor job of emulating the license it holds is not a good design.  Period.  Regardless of how good you think the game is if it were designed to stand alone, it wasn't it was designed to fit a license, which means its going to attract people who are attracted to that license.  Those people are going to have certain expectations about what the game should deliver based on that license...and if it doesn't deliver that...it fails...regardless of whether or not what it does deliver is good or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't buy the TTRPG because I wanted a slick fast playing homage to old school nostalgic gaming.  I bought the TTRPG because I wanted to recreate the experience of the CRPG at the table.  (Which is what the purpose of licenced games are in case you were about to criticize me for having that expectation).  It does a poor job of this.  If you want to dispute this...come back when you've got 100 hours of play in on the CRPG.  Until then you're just talking out your hat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263847/#Comment_263847" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T03:46:42+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  3:46AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw that coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyone interested in taking the discussion in a new direction?

I played through five of the six opening/background acts (before settling on "City Elf") and was through the big bad battle of blood and chaos in about 9 hours or so? If you pick one single lifepath, you probably only need about 4-5 hours into the game before coming to the same conclusions that you did.<br><br>I don't really have an issue with the rules of the CRPG not matching to the rules of the TRPG: The dice mechanics seem ok to me, the range thing isn't a killer for me (since I largely handwave range in games anyway, which I think most people end up doing, based on anecdotal experience from way back in AD&amp;D 2e). And I'd hate to see a 1 to 1 correlation between CRPG and TRPG for combat system, as it's just hit rolls over and over again which would be godawfully boring doing live with real dice (I don't think anyone is advocating that anyway).<br><br>But I think my comments on the background elements still stand: If it doesn't make sense why folks are so confused/dumbfounded by the lack of nobles, Orzammar and Grey Wardens out of the box, then all that does is indicate that they haven't spent even 30-60 minutes on the source property.<br><br>Not that I'm all over Dragon Age as the end-all, be-all property anyway: Ralph loves the game, and spent a lot of time on it. I found it kinda plain, and after about 10 hours basically spent 10 more hours rushing to the end.

He's not saying that the tabletop <i>rules</i> need to match the computer game's.  He's been abundantly clear about that.<br><br/>From what I can tell -- and I've gone back and re-read his posts, so I'm confident about this -- he was trying to make you understand that when you've got a computer game that lets the player start out as a noble and then start playing a Grey Warden within the first couple of hours, that's going to set an expectation for incoming players.  The computer game has told them that they can be nobles and Grey Wardens right out of the gate, and to some (I would suspect MANY) of those people, that's what they're going to think the tabletop game is going to provide to them.<br/><br/>When the tabletop game says "Er, no, sorry, you've got to play a whole lot before you can be a noble or a Grey Warden," it comes off as a bait-and-switch.<br/><br/>This has fuck-all to do with the rule systems involved; this is just a matter of <i>expectations</i>.  If I sold you a tabletop game based on Doom, you would expect that you could play a space marine and fight demons, and rightfully so -- because that's what Doom on the PC let you do.  I can't say "Well, no, the tabletop Doom will only let you start off as a recruit, and you have to do Earthside guard-duty missions until you get up enough experience to qualify for a trip to Mars and demon-killing skills."  (Well, I could, but I'd be a total jerk if I said that.)<br/><br/>It's tricky to balance this stuff, I know, but if the tabletop game says "You can't start as a noble" and the computer game says "You can totally start as a noble," that's a problem.  It might not be a huge problem, it might not be a deal-breaker, but it's a definite disconnect between the tabletop game and the source material...and for a game that's meant to introduce people to tabletop roleplaying, I'm not sure that it's necessarily a good idea to say "This thing you could do in the computer game?  Yeah, fuck you, you can't do that."  Stack up enough little "No-you-can't"s like that one, and you might make a newbie player wonder just what the heck this has to do with the CRPG in the first place.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263927/#Comment_263927" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T13:13:34+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  1:13PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2010 1:14PM by Cedric P.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite><br/>You can't recreate a CRPG experience at the table, no more than you can recreate a TTRPG experience on the computer.</blockquote>\nWe already discussed a little bit about this, but is this a fact?

As a qualifier, I've played through the game, twice, and read the RPG. I enjoy the system, but it isn't what I wanted. I could care less about playing a Grey Warden. What bugged me the most was the lack of nobility, which I'm inclined to think will also be in set 2, and the way magic items are handled.<br/><br/>Yes, magic items.<br/><br/>In the video game, lyrium potions drop frequently and can be bought from almost anyone; you can even craft your own right off the bat. The RPG makes it sound extremely rare on page 39 of the Gamemaster's Guide. Without crafting rules, you have to houserule how rare lyrium potions are; to make it more videogame-esque, I houseruled that characters were unconscious until end of encounter unless all characters were killed. I found myself houseruling enough to make it feel like Dragon Age that I decided to use a different system because my players were looking at me like, "This isn't Dragon Age at all..."<br/><br/>Which brings me to point 2: Next-set-itis.<br/><br/>The idea that nobility, Grey Wardens and crafting are debuting in set 2 is ridiculous. Though it may be an introductory set, having something as basic as crafting a lyrium potion should have been included in set 1 because the videogamers are going to ask for it. The fact that Dragon Age was treated like a run-of-the-mill tabletop RPG is exactly what turned me off.<br/><br/>All in all, my experience with Dragon Age the table top RPG was lackluster as a translation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mearls" title="mearls"><img alt="mearls" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mearls">mearls</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263972/#Comment_263972" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T21:17:39+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  9:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do folks feel about DA as an RPG aimed at beginners, especially in play?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways, it felt to me that the pitch toward newbies is actually aimed at old school players (Look, it's basic D&amp;D all over again!), not actual, never-played-an-RPG-before gamers.

The missile weapons (and distances) are provided in yards, which most people I know are pretty familiar with as a real world measure.

If my imagination says I'm 50 yards away and yours says I'm 80 yards away and my weapon has a range of 70 yards, who's right?  If it doesn't really matter, why are they there.  If I'm on one side of the street and you're on the other, how many yards away is that anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's pretty much no answer you can give to any of that that isn't based on your past experience as a TTRPGer.  A CRPGer doesn't ask any of those questions.  The game he's used to playing treats range instantly and automatically...typically by simply changing the color of his targeting reticule after his weapon is described as "Long Range" or "Short Range".  A Board gamer doesn't ask any of those questions.  The game he's used to playing has rules that are explicit an unambiguous and doesn't in the least bit rely on judgment.  A non gamer of any kind doesn't ask any of those questions.  To them yards are important only on the football field, the last game they played probably involved rolling 2 dice and moving that many spaces, or trying to guess the picture their partner is drawing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly in a TTRPG do you have to ask those questions, and only a TTRPG veteran thinks they are simple or intuitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nA game designed for newbies to RPGs can't rely on hoary old RPG wisdom handed down by oral tradition from the 1970s.  Take a look at how 3:16 handles range.  Explicit and unambiguous.  And far more accessible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf" title="Gavinwulf"><img alt="Gavinwulf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf">Gavinwulf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264437/#Comment_264437" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T21:36:43+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  9:36PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I myself couldn't stand the video game, I tried to like it.

I was trying to put my finger on it, and now it's clear to me.<br>\n<br>\n(My copy of the game is at work, so I'm going off memory here.)<br>\n<br>\nOn one hand, the game is aimed at beginners. On the other, there are a ton of TTRPG assumptions built into it. For instance, character creation is random yet the first step tells you to imagine what your character is like. That undercuts the entire point of random rolling. The nice thing about random generation is that you throw some dice and the game then tells you what character you should play. There's no worry about getting it wrong.<br>\n<br>\nThat kind of thing is really important, IMO. Beginners hate screwing up, and they particularly hate it when they're not sure why they're making a decision. When the game tells you what to choose ("If Intelligence is your highest stat, play a wizard.") that's less pressure on the player.<br>\n<br/>\nThing get even worse on the GM's end. There are almost zero guidelines for how to match monsters against the characters. The GM assigns XP based on difficulty *after* an adventure. There's no mechanical way to judge how tough a situation is until after it's over, and even then the mechanic is "The GM decides how hard it was."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe random encounter tables in old D&amp;D were great for beginning GMs - roll a die, look up the result on a chart, and that's the critter in that dungeon room. All of that randomness pushes the work into a purely world building, plot crafting, space. Even a complete n00b can do that - it draws on general skills most folks have before they crack open an RPG.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264445/#Comment_264445" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T23:44:13+00:00" title="March 29, 2010 11:44PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mearls</cite><br/>The random encounter tables in old D&amp;D were great for beginning GMs - roll a die, look up the result on a chart, and that's the critter in that dungeon room.

I had a friend who got his start in gaming by buying an old D&amp;D; module, and somehow managing to play it with a friend, without a PHB or a DMG. He wasn't even a particularly innovative player, either, just willing. The first game I'd read cover to cover and tried to run without a friend telling me half the rules, when to roll and what to roll was Shadowrun 2E, likewise not the most accessible game in the world. I can't speak for the text of Dragon Age, but I figure the rules can't be more intimidatingly complex than that, can they?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think maybe you just have differing values for the term 'effective' than John does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265228/#Comment_265228" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T14:12:22+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  2:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite><br>I think maybe you just have differing values for the term 'effective' than John does.</br></blockquote>\nSaid a mouthful there. As far as I can see, this whole thread is mostly about Ralph's advanced cultural agenda in redefining what usability means for a roleplaying game. Basically it's an argument between "if it's like Red Box then it's usable" and "we have new standards against which Red Box is not at all usable". Dragon Age is just an excuse for this more general discussion, it seems to me. It'd probably be much clearer if Ralph raised a counter-example, some concrete steps that could be taken or have been taken in rpgs to make them more effective as introductory games for videogamers.<br><br>It's easy to symphatize with Ralph on this matter, not the least because I've been working on rpg usability myself through the last couple of years, and am pretty convinced that there are things that can be done to traditional rpg texts to make them more accessible and usable outside the tradition. I'm not so sure that I would consider all of Ralph's specific points too cogent (not convinced that the license is that significant for the usability experience, for one thing), but I haven't seen either the video game nor the rpg under discussion here, so what do I know. The basic point is pertinent, however: there are many radical things that could be done to make rpg texts more usable, and as far as I've heard this new game does nothing of the sort, but rather cleaves close to archaic traditions of the form. So if it's to be considered usable for beginners, then we're basically affirming the idea that practically every mainstream rpg text since the mid-'80s is more or less usable in this regard. Perhaps that is the case, but if it is so, then the whole topic of usability seems like a non-issue.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Just because something is usable for beginners doesn't mean it's optimally usable. Just because I could read and parse out how to play Shadowrun from the text doesn't mean that FASA couldn't have done a better job of facilitating that.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsability and user testing are still incredibly useful concepts for RPG design. I'm still waiting for John to start that discussion on User testing. I guess I could have done it in the interim, but hey...<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from amusing banter and stories, I read S-G for discussions of things that worked in play, what didn't work in play, what could have worked in play, and what can be done to improve play. I have a folder full of links for discussions useful to my process with Mage Blade which includes several that have nothing to do with my game, but which introduce or discuss concepts that I want to think about in regards to how they may affect specific mechanics, procedures and methods of communicating in Mage Blade. Among other things, I'm trying to glean usability techniques from discussions which may only tangentially relate to it. That's part of why I kept tuning back into this thread, apart from the innate human urge to pick at wounds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265321/#Comment_265321" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-03T10:22:47+00:00" title="April  3, 2010 10:22AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>So your opinion is that someone who has never played a TTRPG before, but is familiar with the concept of playing a character in a story from CRPG play could pick up the box set and with a group of similar players, play the game effectively without the assistance of someone who's been reading rpg texts since 1978?</blockquote>\nYes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265331/#Comment_265331" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-03T11:29:13+00:00" title="April  3, 2010 11:29AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, John.  I find that highly dubious and would predict far more attempts ending in flameout and failure than success, but we can all dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nWolfe, I think the key word in your posts above is "willing".  With enough will man can do any thing.  As JD Corley is found of pointing out even the most atrocious gaming instruments can be made to play sweet music (with enough will).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think the standards for useability are dramatically different today than when my friends and I got started in roleplaying with a mixed assortment of Basic and 1ed Advanced D&amp;D; books (that we didn't realize weren't supposed to be the same game) and a mess of notebooks full of our own inventions to fill in the spaces where we had no books.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the 10-15yr old demographic which is when most gamers first get introduced and hooked into the hobby.  Today TTRPGing has to compete with:  World of Warcraft, XBox Live, DVDs, Netflix, OnDemand, streaming video, You Tube, Web 2.0 social apps, texting and chat, hand held gaming devices, 3D movies, and a whole host of entertainment fomats that didn't exist in 1978-1986 when I was getting into gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key measure IMO is "how long till the fun starts".  What all of those things I listed above have in common is near instant gratification and accessibility.  WoW is tremendously layered and nuanced and complex to master...yet you can also start playing almost immediately from the time the game is installed.  Its not just "Complex" vs. "Simple".  I think the above demographic today has no more trouble with mastering complexity than we did back in the day.  Instead its "degree of fun per unit of time".  How long till the fun starts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving to sit and scratch your head and try to guess what the GM is supposed to do to make the game work...its doable...with sufficient will its totally doable.  But I think far far fewer people today are going to be willing to do that than were willing to do it back in the day, simply because there are so many other fun forms of entertainment that don't take so long to get working.  Not that there were all that many people willing to do it back in the day as judged by how small this niche hobby has always been.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as a reminider, I'm not saying all RPGs need to be targeted towards beginners in this way.  I'm merely pointing out that if if Dragon Age was meant to be, as some have suggested it was...by my standards...epic fail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265346/#Comment_265346" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-03T13:18:01+00:00" title="April  3, 2010  1:18PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>The key measure IMO is "how long till the fun starts".</blockquote>\nI think that's one thing that people look for, I think there are other tastes, though, too.  When I was younger, I learned to play the clarinet not because squeaking and squawking and honking badly for week after week was fun... it wasn't fun, it was frustrating and lame. But I was willing to invest because I knew there was fun up the road. I think games can promise the same thing effectively.  "I don't know how to play this game, agh!"

Playability and understandability first. Faithfulness comes after that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br>When the tabletop game says "Er, no, sorry, you've got to play a whole lot before you can be a noble or a Grey Warden," it comes off as a bait-and-switch.</br></blockquote>\nWhen I played Baldur's Gate I expected my Thief to be able to climb walls and Command to allow for more than just "Die", that's a similar bait and switch.

For instance, character creation is random yet the first step tells you to imagine what your character is like. That undercuts the entire point of random rolling. The nice thing about random generation is that you throw some dice and the game then tells you what character you should play. There's no worry about getting it wrong.</br></blockquote>\nYou have a brief idea, roll the dice, trade two stats if necessary to get it. If you think of a really detailed character you might have a problem, but that even crops up with point buy systems which are more complicated and supposed to handle any character concept. In my experience newbies pick one thing or idea that they're interested in, they don't get excessively detailed.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266047/#Comment_266047" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T00:00:15+00:00" title="April  8, 2010 12:00AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talking about levels 1-5, that's really not as big of a problem as it seems. I ran an AD&amp;D 2e game at a con, one of the players had his original PHB from 1989 so he'd been playing for over a decade. The pregen characters I made were levels 8-10. He'd never played characters that high before, as everyone he'd played with would always stop and make new characters around levels 4-6. I also remember making a vast number of low level characters for AD&amp;D but not going very high with them. 1-3 in BD&amp;D is a little bit short, but 5 is actually a pretty solid range. I think the biggest problem with it will be the sales pyramid - probably 4-8 times as many of Set 1 will be sold as Set 4.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11096/dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11096/dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11096/dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11096/dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11096/dragon-age-ttrpg-a-brief-review/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11096%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11096%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
