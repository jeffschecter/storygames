                    So, I'm sitting here trying to figure out what the GM's role in Misery Bubblegum is.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the players are in charge of their internal and relationship conflicts.  Literally, the cards are sitting right in front of them.<br/>
<br/>
And, as the GM, I'm usually holding a bunch of "External Conflict" cards.  But, really, those aren't singing ... like, at all.  When you're dealing with "Relationship:  You don't deserve what you have" a conflict like "External:  Your world is under attack" can never be anything more than a grace note.  At least that's what it's looking like in play-test.<br/>
<br/>
And, looking at it, I think it's because the external conflicts are all phrased as threats and constraints.  They're meant to inspire players to <b>react</b>, but all of the internal and relationship conflicts are meant to inspire players to <b>act</b>.  There's an incompatibility there, and people are consistently choosing the active rather than the reactive course, and pushing the external conflicts to one side.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that something as simple as rephrasing the external conflicts as <b>prizes</b> rather than <b>threats</b> could have a substantial effect on game-play.  Isn't that strange?  But something like "Prize:  Peace" (or "Prize: Safety" ... two difference conflicts there!) looks like it will work a lot better with the rest of the game than "Threat:  External attack."<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?  Do you think I'm making too much of such a subtle change?                </div>

                            I think it makes sense. Because of the internal focus that you describe the external threat isn't going to have a lot of probative value -- it puts the action back in the external world and thus not where players are tending to concentrate. <br><br>The oportunity to gain something that shifts the internal landscape in a way that you want, otoh, could be a huge incentive. The only question I have is how you make sure you give the character the right conflicts -- as if you have a "win this conflict get "saftey"" prize and the character doesn't want saftey, what happens? <br><br>Or does it at that point become sort of a dialogue between players and the GM? By seeing which prizes they chase after and which they don't, everyone at the table gets a clearer understanding of what's going on?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Immediate reaction:  Thinking that external prizes ("Lisa agreed to go to the prom with me!") are the solutions to internal problems ("I feel so alone ...") is pretty key to the whole teenage experience.<br/>

                            Heh.  Okay, here's some thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
There should be value to winning the prizes.  They should have some benefit in terms of facing your internal problems ... indeed, they should have a benefit to <i>whoever</i> wins them.<br/>
<br/>
But if getting the date to the prom is <b>actually</b> the solution to feeling so alone, every game ... urgh ... that's not what I want either.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very tempted to apply the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction" rel="nofollow">Dollar-Auction</a> technique to the whole situation:  Make the prize <i>way</i> more valuable than you need to spend on your first effort to achieve it ... and likewise, make it more valuable than it costs someone else to try to take it away from you.  Eventually, folks end up putting more resources than the Prize was worth because <i>by God</i> they're not going to walk away from all the resources they've already sunk into trying to earn it.                        </div>

                            Tony, <br><br>I like that.<br><br>I like it because it should work from a game perspective, and because it works from a thematic perspective. After all going to prom actually can help you feel less alone and network and get a girl and all that crap. But when you so overinvest in the point of prom that it becomes bigger than everything else then it becomes a problem all its own. <br><br>And god forbid you get there and then not be able to follow it through....<br><br>So what if the prizes weren't things that were done when you got them, but only gave you a chance to do some kind of contest that others couldn't do? Like if the prize "take the cheerleader to prom" doesn't give you happiness, but just lets you have a conflict that could solve something for you -- or could only make it worse. <br><br>(To give a horrible, crap ass shit example, Fallout Boy's video for "Dance Dance" where one nerd is saved and the other damned by trying to do essentially the same thing at the school dance.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Oh, that's a neat idea.  In order to resolve your personal conflicts you need to <i>first</i> win an external whatsis.<br/>
<br/>
Even more fun if there are less external whatsis's ("whatses"?) than there are internal conflicts around the table.<br/>
<br/>
Hrm ... I'd have to figure where the break between relationships and internal conflicts plays into that.  I could imagine, for instance, a Prize helping you resolve a relationship issue and then the relationship issue helping you resolve an internal conflict issue (or vice versa ... prize -&gt; Internal -&gt; Relationship).  That might be neat too.                        </div>

                            Is there a way to make it a free choice of goods somehow? IOW, real life and fiction both produce outcomes in which any of the following could be the case, right?<br><br>1. I get to go to the prom with Lisa and it makes me feel less alone.<br><br>2. I get to go to the prom with Lisa and it makes me feel more alone than ever.<br><br>3. I don't get to go to the prom with Lisa but I feel less alone anyway.<br/><br/>4. I don't get to go to the prom with Lisa and it makes me feel more alone than ever.<br/><br/>5. Feeling less alone causes Lisa to go to the prom with me.<br/><br/>6. Feeling more alone causes Lisa to go to the prom with me.<br/><br/>Any of which can be satisfying story outcomes. Picturing the game as meaning that an "I don't want to feel alone" card and a "I want Lisa to go to the prom" card are sitting on the table, the player should be able to "play for" either or both and "win" either or both.<br/><br/>Sky High is a story where all the "good guys" win both cards. Spider-Man I is a story where Peter "wins" the external card - Mary Jane declares her love, but not the internal card (something like "I feel a crushing burden of responsibility".) In Spider-Man 2, Peter wins both cards, but there's a suggestion in that Helga-picturesque final shot that Mary Jane has picked up an unpleasant new internal one.<br/><br/>While I can't think of an immediate example of "spurns the external card, wins the internal," it seems like a staple of a whole class of coming-of-age stories. For that matter, so does, "spurns the external, embraces the internal."<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/><br/>Jim                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Ah. Experience trumps, of course. Ways around it maybe:<br/><br/>1. Just decide that you only care about that genre where all internal conflicts are externalized and you can't win the internal without winning the external.<br/><br/>2. What if the external card is two cards - "Lisa goes to the prom with me" AND "Lisa doesn't go to the prom with me" and you have to play for/win ONE of them?<br/><br/>3.

                            Okay, secondary question:<br/><br/>Suppose (for the sake of thinkin') we take Brand's insight as valid:  External prizes should provide the key for resolving internal conflicts (and probably vice versa).<br/><br/>Suppose further that we stick with my current understanding, which is that the game is <i>simply not about</i> the <b>GM</b> portraying the internal conflicts of NPCs (though, since GM role and who plays what character can change session to session, you can still have <i>Tony</i> playing <i>Kyle's</i> internal conflicts ... but when Eric's GMing).<br/><br/>Does that mean that the GM <b>can't benefit</b> from winning the external prizes?  Is there any purpose to his winning them, other than to put the fear of God into the players?  Or is he like an auctioneer, whose purpose is to drive people into a frenzy of bidding, but then let the prize go to someone else?  What's the GM's motivation for providing adversity supposed to be?                        </div>

                            Yes.<br/><br/>To elaborate: if the players care about the external world enough to want things, they should get say in it.  If they don't care, they shouldn't get say in it.<br/><br/>You can do this two ways.  You can give players resources to manipulate the world if they win, and just let the GM hang, or you can give both sides resources.<br/><br/>If I were the GM and, say, no one cared about winning the "victory" prize, I'd want to be able to say "Okay, six months later, the aliens have destroyed all civilization and you're all slaves in the Pain Mines" or whatever.  I don't think I'd be (socially) able to do that absent some mechanical representation.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Ben:  I think if the GM's "prize" is the ability to do things that the players would otherwise reject outright then ... well ... that's back to it being a "threat" again, at least as far as the players are concerned, isn't it?                        </div>

                            Hrm ... or it could be an opportunity to resolve the internal conflict of one of the players' characters.<br/><br/>Like, suppose I'm GMing, and Kyle is one of NPCs, while Cody is Eric's PC.  Kyle has no internal conflicts, because the game is about Cody's conflicts (because Eric's a player, and I'm the GM).  Cody has "I want to believe" as an internal conflict, and I have "Prize: Victory" out on the table.  If I win "Victory" then I now have the opportunity (not the guarantee, but the opportunity) to resolve the "I want to believe" conflict.  If I get the right rolls then I can say later "Okay, since I won that roll your 'I want to believe' conflict is resolved by this scene of you being betrayed and left for dead.  How does that play out for Cody, internally?"                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>Would tying conflicts together when you generate them work?  Say when you create an internal conflict you write down one external conflict and one relationship that it is mechanically 'tied' to.  Winning something lets you move to resolve (perhaps at a bonus?) the conflicts it's tied to.  Ties go both directions.<br/><br/>I don't know.  It sounds interesting to me...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            I do that already, but the ties are just there in the creation.  They don't carry over into the game itself.  That's deliberate.  It makes sure that the things are grabby enough that they <i>could</i> be tied to something, which means that they're often grabby enough to be tied to something <i>completely unexpected</i> later.<br/><br/>For instance, we create "Where do I belong?" together with "You don't deserve what you have" to represent someone jealous of a newcomer.  Then we create "I can't lose control" together with "Duty Calls" to represent someone torn between their duty and their passion.  But in the actual play, we quickly find that "Where do I belong?" gets brought up more often in connection with "Duty Calls" than anything else, and so the story turns out to be about someone trying to define their place in the world by what they can do for those around them.<br/><br/>Still trying to figure out how to mix that with Brand's "key to resolution" idea, which is a lot easier if they're resolved separately, one after the other.                        </div>
