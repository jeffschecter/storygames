Granted, I have a set of strategies for getting around this problem, BUT...<br/><br/>It appears that, taken in a certain light, 3:16 could have also had this problem.  It's got a fighty bits and its got non-fighty bits, but one thing I haven't heard anyone complain about is a disconnect between the two.  No one has said that they felt 3:16 was all about fighting with no opportunity to roleplay.  From those who have played (I plan to join your ranks soon...), how does 3:16 go about balancing the two or does it?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166394/#Comment_166394" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T23:20:09+00:00" title="August 31, 2008 11:20PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far in every play I have seen, role-play and combat are nicely balanced.

Not only that, but several little details make the combat actions really tie into the narrative: you cancel your success to end the turn: how that goes in the fiction? You roll NFA to maneuver: how do you do that? Maybe even more importantly: you fail... how? What did you do?<br/><br/>[*] I have experienced something like your battletech syndrome (I think) with DnD 4E: when on the battlemap I tend to play it like a skirmish miniatures game... but hey, that's why I got into it, actually, so it's good, and I still get to narrate crazy stunts and gruesome dagger slashes. 4E has so much going on mechanically that I feel I need all my attention to play it "right" according to the rules. Not only that, but its hard gamist bent means that I feel the "pressure" to actually play it "right" to "win"!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166476/#Comment_166476" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T11:39:28+00:00" title="September  1, 2008 11:39AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found it hard at first in D&amp;D4e to play "in character" when we were skirmishing the combats. Mostly I was positioning my character and just declare my attacks from the sheet. Fun and quick, but it was very much "game speak". Outside of combats there was more "in character" stuff.<br/><br/>In 3:16 I think the Flashbacks really help. If, at first, the description is pretty short in combat then that's fine. But once someone (anyone) has a Flashback it introduces the concept of significant narrative events to the table. And they are something that everyone has access to. After that the characterization picks up significantly, since the audience now is angling for who their character is relative to what was in the last Flashback or they hope will be in their next.<br/><br/>Also, the book says "Match The Fiction To The Encounters" and if the GM keeps asking that of the players it's fine.

My feeling was that Flashbacks and the matching of the fiction to the encounters were the two primary ways 3:16 got the job done.  On the other hand, there was a bit in there about scene framing and so I was wondering if anyone would jump out say scene framing helped/hurt roleplay.  Oh, and Gregor, in case you are wondering, yours was one of two games I could study to better understand the intertwining of narrative and combat.  So hopefully that will make you feel good.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Hey Chris,<br/><br/>Empire of Dust seems pretty fighty. You've played it?

A good percentage of the Traits, especially the non-unique ones, involve cool things you can do on the battlefield.  Plus banter.  Banter rules.  Plus, I think it's got a lot of the match the fiction to the encounters in example.<br/><br/>Which is also what Tenra Bansho Zero does in addition to players giving each other bonuses.

Mot importantly, I don't have any option to (say, a la SotC) invoke an Aspect to get a bonus or perform a stunt. Or burn a relationship, betray a companion and get a hefty bonus in combat. <br/>The rules for combat in 4E don't have any explicit hook into the narrative, fictional aspect of my character, basically. So, when we are on the battlemap, we are on the battlemap: all the rules are hooked into the combat/power/stats aspect of the character. <br/><br/>So, it does not really matter that my halfling rogue is a smartass with a good heart and really cares for his dragonborn friend, apart for the cases when I have to choose which tactical decision to engage (do I cover his back or leave him and strike someone else)? Obviously there's STILL some "roleplaying" stuff going on (the fiction might make me choose the non-optimal tactical option), but it's <em>generally secondary</em>.<br/><br/>I hope I made some sense <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166564/#Comment_166564" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T06:33:11+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  6:33AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2008 6:33AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way our game worked, to begin with it was all blasty-blasty-blasty but roleplaying happened - especially as I started playing the superiors as bastards and stepping up my NPC roleplay with the other expendable grunts.<br/><br/>One of my favorite moments is when the PCs were fighting these weird rock-ape things in an asteroid belt and found the central hive. They radioed in the coordinates to the ship for artillery fire or whatever and the ship was like "artillery is unavailable - your squad will have to move in and sweep the hive." It was one of those really frustrating situations I see in movies all the time.<br/><br/>There's also been something cool where the LT has been talking shit about the superiors. We're all interested in what's going to happen when he BECOMES a superior.<br/><br/>Anyway, it totally happens, and also if you consider describing cool action sequences to be roleplaying, which I do, roleplaying does not have to be secondary.
