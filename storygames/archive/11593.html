The animal size comparison chart is also a big sell! <br/><br/>The fight mechanic and improve your skills as you use them sold the people today due to their World of Warcraft experience. They were confused by the character sheet at first (especially what the skills meant) and then the idea of earning checks by using traits against yourself but everything else was smooth. Combat was especially smooth. <br/><br/>I roleplay with a lot of people who have never played before and I love how RPGs easily allow for different methods of play to exist at the same time. For example, I tailor how I run by taking the player's lead. If they talk in character, I will do the same. if they talk in 3rd person, so will I. If they want to know what everything in the scene looks like, I will describe it. If they just want to know what the obstacle, difficulty, and skill needed is, I stick to that. We were able to easily mix all of these in the same game with no problem and allow everyone enough space to get comfortable. <br/><br/>It also helps to make it clear, in this game if you don't work together, you will die alone (a bit of an exaggeration but it helps sell how important teamwork is)! It's like the opposite of Dogs in the Vineyard where if you work together, you never fail and it's boring. Laying out the expectations immediately is huge. <br/><br/>I had a lot of fun. <br/><br/>It's a super easy game for newbies to enjoy. I have no idea how easy it would be for new players to run (the first time I ran it wasn't great but the second time it flew). I'd love to user test it. I've become a bit obsessed with user testing software and user and information designs. It's amazing what difficult concepts people understand with ease and what seemingly simple concepts create huge roadblocks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258354/#Comment_258354" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T00:04:55+00:00" title="February 25, 2010 12:04AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice one!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258386/#Comment_258386" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T05:36:39+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  5:36AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's superb.<br/><br/>User testing is interesting.<br/><br/>The games that work well with newbies, I think, will be the ones where you can say "Don't worry about the character sheet.

It\u2019s sometimes difficult to get people to work as a team. Not at all here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were less interested in \u201cdoing anything\u201d and wanted to know how to win, their options, and the odds of success. They also play a lot of Texas Hold\u2019em and Dominoes which is worth noting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey spoke mostly in 3rd person but occasionally spoke in character when trying to get something from an NPC.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I explained that Mouse Guard is an ongoing game, they didn\u2019t flinch. They are used to organizing weeknight card games and 30+ people for WoW raids. They always have to schedule around multiple people, changing shifts, and family needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey loved rolling dice and building dice pools.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of GMing seemed intimidating to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of playing traits against themselves was strange to them. But when I explained that it\u2019s like a movie or TV show, sometimes the most dramatic moments is when characters make bad decisions, especially ones that show us how flawed they are, and that by doing so in Mouse Guard you get extra scenes later to do whatever you want (recover, buy stuff, make allies, build armies, go after enemies) they were down with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe felt using traits against themselves on rolls that they were almost guaranteed to fail anyway was incredibly cheap but they did it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey loved that failing skills actually helped them improve those skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were pissed when they rolled incredibly on a Maneuver roll (6 successes) but their opposition had nothing for them to disarm, thus their extra successes felt wasted. In fact, every time they had extra successes they wanted to do something with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference between Pathfinder and Scout confused them at first as well as loremouse. They thought loremouse meant they knew stuff about mice, not other animals. But it all became clear when I showed them a list of the skill factors on the GM reference sheet I put together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had no problem with scripted combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey loved the map.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey really liked rewards at the end of the mission. Someone joked, It's "payday."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259038/#Comment_259038" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T22:19:29+00:00" title="February 27, 2010 10:19PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br><br>Awesome run-down!

Will you?</blockquote>\nUser Testing (or usability testing) is great for observing what happens when real people get their hands on whatever you want to test.<br><br>It\u2019s similar to blind playtesting except more controlled. More importantly you don\u2019t draw conclusions by asking for people\u2019s opinions. Instead you watch how well and how easily people use something. Actions speak louder than words!<br><br>Specifically you want to measure performance, accuracy, recall, and emotional response. Techniques for gathering data vary from simply taking notes to recording hand and eye movement, using think aloud protocols, and tracking stress levels. <br><br>Typically once we have something we can test we\u2026<br>&gt; identify who will most likely use whatever we are testing<br>&gt; determine what we want them to accomplish<br>&gt; identify priority tasks to test<br>&gt; create natural scenarios encompassing those tasks<br>&gt; recruit at least 3 uninitiated users<br>&gt; run people through scenarios<br>&gt; take caution not to influence people\u2019s action (asking leading questions)<br>&gt; record data using any of the techniques mentioned above<br>&gt; create a report identifying problems discovered<br>&gt; debrief<br>&gt; decide what to fix<br>&gt; fix before next round of testing<br>&gt; test again using different people<br><br>If it\u2019s unclear which fixes will work best you can perform A/B or Multivariate testing. For example, with A/B testing, you distribute different versions of a test (including a control test) with a single variable changed to see which change moves you closer to your goals. But for these specific tests to be effective, you need to reach a large enough audience that there is a reasonable chance of detecting meaningful differences between the distributed tests. Difficult for a small game with a limited audience but very useful for websites. <br><br>Even with Usability Testing you have to be careful. With such a small sample size the sample group is unlikely to be representative of a larger population. So it\u2019s difficult to draw larger conclusions about the population itself. But these techniques are excellent for quickly identifying problems with what your testing and taking action to fix them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259585/#Comment_259585" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T08:29:39+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  8:29AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2010 8:30AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, excellent, thanks!<br><br/>How does one meaningfully distinguish user testing from a straight-up blind playtest in our context (small group roleplaying games)?

When you accumulate a certain number of passes and fails, your skill or ability goes up!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a fantastic mechanic for long term play. Unfortunately I run a lot of 1 shots. Usually people who have experience roleplaying get it immediately and will mark passes and fails even if it likely won't help them since we are playing 1 game. But people who have never played tabletop RPGs before sometimes have difficulty with it. It won't help them now so they don't pay too much attention to it. That said, players with experience with video games like WoW are all over this!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I decided to experiment. On each pregenerated character I marked off several passes and fails. Specifically on a few low rated skills so there is a chance one may advance in a 1 shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results so far have been wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nNew players now pay close attention to marking every pass and fail (social proof is a powerful thing!) and when a skill does go up in play, even from a rating of 2 to 3, they explode with joy!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there is an added benefit! Sometimes to advance a skill you need a failure which drives new players to purposefully take extra risks. Tie that with earning checks by using traits against yourself and things really get moving. It really starts to capture the feel of a group having played a few sessions even in a simple 1 shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nFun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259679/#Comment_259679" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T12:52:01+00:00" title="March  2, 2010 12:52PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2010 12:52PM by Brian_Minter.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's more good and useful stuff in this one thread than in all the Commie/kraken/cracker threads put together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
