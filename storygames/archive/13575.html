I hope everyone had a great last few weeks and is looking forward to 2011.<br/><br/>First, an important announcement: Sandie Law has joined the staff of the ENnie Awards as a Volunteer Coordinator. It seems that our current Volunteer Coordinator, Gertie Barden Nichols, will be unable to attend Gen Con this year. Sandie has graciously volunteered to step in and help with managing all the volunteer options associated with the ENnies. If you have any questions for her, you can e-mail her at <a href="mailto:booth@ennieawards.com" rel="nofollow">booth@ennieawards.com</a>.<br/><br/>And now the question.<br/><br/>It is a tradition for many people to make resolutions concerning the new year as it approaches. Here at the ENnies, we're no different. Our resolutions, of course, all involve RPGs.<br/><br/>To read the Staff resolutions, and to post your own, please visit us at <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?p=1724" rel="nofollow">http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?p=1724</a>.<br/><br/>Tony Law<br/>ENnies Business Manager                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
