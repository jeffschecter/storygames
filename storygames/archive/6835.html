PLUS Chris Bennett's one-page alien contact game ashcan.<br/><br/>Endgame also had a few copies of a 5-page preview of <em>Don't Lose Your Mind</em>, the upcoming supplement to <em>Don't Rest your Head</em>.  All of those were gone by day's end.  I ran 3 demos for DRYH upstairs when I wasn't running <em>Polaris</em>, but a casual scan of the DRYH website doesn't show me where I got the demo from.  Jimmy Hoffa cut a deal with the ethereal tiger, and DB Cooper got away, as he always does. Amelia Earhart saved the day, as is her way.<br/>The Polaris players got free copies of XsL too.<br/><br/>There were still some games left at the end of the day, including some XsL, so maybe Sunday will be Free Game Day 2: Eclectic Bugaboo.<br/><br/>Caeser_X bought a 4e DMG to go with his PHB, and compared 4e to college football.<br/><br/>I finally bought <em>Burning Empires</em>, which I totally blame on Paul Tevis' recent podcast about his campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152184/#Comment_152184" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T00:57:14+00:00" title="June 22, 2008 12:57AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I scored like a banshee at EndGame today.

(I know he's some kind of action movie hero guy from movies I've never seen, but my knowledge ends there.)<br/><br/>My question about street luge was answered pretty well by this video: <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-5AiN7mHp1eY?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AiN7mHp1eY"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/5AiN7mHp1eY/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>which gives some pretty good inspiration for both obstacles and bullshitting.  Check out the bit around 2:10 where the one guy starts just humping the other guy for no reason.  IT'S EXXTREME!<br/><br/>Anyway, though, I'm very disappointed that your free, pocket-sized pamphlet didn't include detailed setting information.  I think you need to release a line of expensive hardcover supplements and splatbooks covering the history and practice of street luge, as well as the biography and filmography of Vin Diesel, in excruciating stat-filled detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152263/#Comment_152263" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T12:47:59+00:00" title="June 22, 2008 12:47PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still poring over the stuff I got for free ( I bought minis gaming goodness by Ganesha games, too, so that's been my reading focus).<br/><br/>One that might have been overlooked that I'm digging with my mid-day coffee is <i>Punjar: The Tarnished Jewel</i>[Dungeon Crawl Classics line from Goodman Games].<br/><br/>It's a little, grimy fantasy city along the lines of Sanctuary or Lankhmar, with a D&amp;D fantasy spin. It's systemless, however, with no stats of any kind in the item. To me, that's a benefit, not a weakness. It's short ( 16 pages), and keeps to rough sketches and hooks that are left hanging to expand in whatever direction you see fit. In any case, it clearly mirrors that type of setting, minus the baggage that can accompany trying to set an adventure in an existing setting from a series of books.<br/><br/>Despite the traditional warning to character players to keep out, this one could be used as a very cool open-book item with the Dirty-Hippy Game of your choice- IAWA would work well with this, as would other games containing a play phase where the group collectively fleshes out what they want from the game ( Universalis and PTA come to mind).<br/><br/>Heck, it might work better with a DHG than with D&amp;D...<br/><br/>It isn't perfect by any stretch. Mysteriously little detail is given about the actual overlord of the city or his personal quarter, and it does hit about every grimy fantasy city cliche you've ever read. <br/><br/>I suspect this one got overlooked with all the goodies there to choose from. At EG, there were a small stack of them left at around 5pm. Anyone who digs that sort of setting might want to check with their FLGS and see if they have any left.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152307/#Comment_152307" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T19:49:34+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  7:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had planned to come back early from the cottage and hit three stores on the way down. all three in Ontario. The store in Owen sound apparently pulled out before the day, and my wife really wanted to stay another day so I skipped Saturday but stopped in the store listed in Godrich. Not only did they not participate they are going out of business. Disheartened I didn't even look for the store in Sarnia to ask how it went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152312/#Comment_152312" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T20:02:01+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  8:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those looking around, <a href="http://www.freerpgday.com/stores.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.freerpgday.com/stores.htm</a> has list of participating retailers.<br/><br/>I went by my FLGS (Gary's Games) this afternoon, and got Traveller, T&amp;T, Hunter the Vigil, Heirs to Olympia (which I was interested in because I talked to the guy who is doing this at Gamestorm this year), and the little CoC Larp thing.  Sadly there was no sign of the very cool sounding Punjar setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
