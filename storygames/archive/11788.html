I can easily imagine each of the characters from their traits.<br/><br/>I wanted the characters to be more strongly interrelated. It's a one-shot; why not establish A loving B and C hating A?<br/><br/>I'm not sure how giving the Narrator authority over advancement makes the game more fun. The game Keys were pulled from - The Shadow of Yesterday - absolutely sings without the Narrator being involved. More broadly, advancement might not even have a place in a tightly focused, kill-centric survival horror one-shot.<br/><br/>I was going to say the same thing about adding hit points, but as a sort of countdown timer I can see the value there. I think you could do the same thing with conditions, though - maybe with a "two and out" rule. It's a one shot; the second (or third, or whatever) condition applied is always "Dead". So you can get Trapped once, but if you then get Tired ... the monsters get you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263697/#Comment_263697" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T11:26:34+00:00" title="March 23, 2010 11:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2010 11:27AM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>(So, I lost a big long post I was going to put in here and retyped some of it, just now. Forgive this for being rushed, please.)</i><br/><br/><br/>Right. Keys. Ordinarily, I'm a big believer in naming every mechanism, nub, and sprue in a game system \u2014 if only just to make the game easy to talk about \u2014 but in this case I filed off the name for the sake of one night's simplicity. I wanted the bullet points to feel dry, like they came out of an employment record or dossier, too, though I'd do that differently if I'd known that I was going to show these characters to people two months later.<br/><br/>As to why I called for Narrator approval, it's simply this: I wanted the player to tug on my sleeve before they initiated the description or dialogue that was going to call on their bullet point. I wanted to be able to point my spotlight at them then. Also, I wanted to use my authority for approval to coax more out of their performance \u2014\xa0it creates a moment where we pause and talk about the character or the advancement choice that follows. <br/><br/>"Nice," I say, "Are you saying this to everyone or just to him?" Or: "It sounds like maybe you've got tears in your eyes about this\u2026" And then, "And what advancement are you going to take as a result of that?" And then, maybe, "Why is that?" <br/><br/>I like breaking the fourth wall with my players and talking to them about their decisions. It's a chance to talk shop like writers and actors, and it puts focus on the fact that the players <i>are</i> insinuating and implying things with their performances, though sometimes that stuff gets overlooked because everyone's looking inward at their next play, their next characterization. We stop and we talk shop for a minute, as if play was a rich rehearsal rather than a live performance, and then we remember to watch each other as peers appreciating a performance, not just an audience trying to suss out meaning or keep up with the action.<br/><br/>Also, remember that hitting a bullet point gets an immediate advancement, here. This is, in part, because I think the play choice of picking your next tag is a great decision point and I wanted to see it happen a few times before characters died. Everything needed to be faster. <br/><br/>So Narrator approval gave me time to work the throttle a bit and, one time, say, "Hold on, you just got an advancement \u2014\xa0can you include somebody else in this bit?" There's a reason that so many of the characters have their marital or familial status and employment history on there \u2014\xa0they connect like puzzle pieces. You start talking about how your contract is almost up, and it creates an opening for someone else to hit their bullet point, too.<br/><br/>That said, if I had more room and time to spend on this subject, I'd include this note: I approved of every potential advancement. I was ready to say, "Hold on, give someone else a turn to advance," but I didn't have to. I might change the rule to something else, like "No player can advance again until another player has advanced," just to keep individual players from rocketing ahead, if that's better.<br/><br/>In practice, that's why I put approval in there \u2014\xa0to regulate. <br/><br/>It's one thing when five lines of dialogue about your employment contract being up in a few weeks gets you an eventual advancement. It's something else when a single line of dialogue does it. I wanted to have some regulatory power, just in case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263700/#Comment_263700" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T11:46:11+00:00" title="March 23, 2010 11:46AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Will,<br/><br/>I totally get where you're coming from.

It's just that the responsibility for asking the questions and being curious about the Keys isn't concentrated in the GM; it's a thing every player does. I'd wager this is just a matter of play style and comfort level with different techniques. Many roads to Rome, and all that.<br/><br/>Also, I think faster advancement (1 advance when you hit a bullet point rather than 1 xp) is totally the right way to go for a tight one-shot like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263701/#Comment_263701" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T11:57:34+00:00" title="March 23, 2010 11:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2010 12:26PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, y'all, thanks for taking the time to read this and write in about it.<br/><br/>First, play time: With four players, our play time was about four hours. I used the Drive! encounter a few times, though, to get us through the map a little faster. <br/><br/>Honestly, I'm not entirely thrilled with the pre-gen characters. I think they're individually strong, but I didn't tie them together too much because I didn't want to prescribe who each character thought should live, and because I didn't want them to be inward-facing as a group. Frankly, I think I went too far in the other direction. So it goes. <br/><br/>The secrets help with this a little bit, but my players barely used their secrets. I've dialed up their usefulness in this document a bit to encourage their use even in death.<br/><br/>About advancement: Broadly speaking, you might be right, Jason. I've run these one-shot winnowing-character stories a whole lot over the years, and typically I don't worry about advancement at all. But I thought the pick-a-new-tag advancement was so elegant, so quick, and so satisfying as a gameplay choice that I wanted to include it. Plus, with the dwindling player pools, anything that got a new tag into play was useful. <br/><br/>Simply put, I thought the advancement mechanism was too much fun to leave out in this case. <br/><br/>As for why I replaced the Tired, Injured, and Dead conditions with Health, I had a couple of reasons. First, I was designing for a particular bunch of players, and I thought the gradual decline of Health better suited the way they eyeballed survival and peril. Second, it afforded a more granular mechanism for determining who would attempt to face off again alien beasts and what the consequence for that would be. It meant that not all failures were created equal. <br/><br/>I was concerned that conditions alone meant that I would just be deciding who died \u2014\xa0I didn't want to apply a condition for <i>every</i> failed obstacle, and once I'm doing it for some and not others, I'm playing kingmaker more than I wanted to be. The fun is for the players to do it, I thought, and they do it by choosing who will engage the aliens and who will run. Plus, it provided some variety by having two types obstacles \u2014 standard and battle \u2014\xa0which created the vibe that there was running and fighting and that they felt different. It worked for us.<br/><br/>For sure, though, a condition-only method could work, too. If it helps the Narrator make the death spiral colorful, even better. I'm pretty good at making hit points colorful, though, so I chose to use them.<br/><br/>Remember, <i>Alien Survivor</i> isn't some implicit declaration of how I think these things must be done, or what the Right Way is to do it. It's a report on one way to do it that worked for us. I'm releasing it, in part, to see if it works for others, too.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear of other spins on the material and how they work out. I'm hoping I'll be smarter for having released this thing, and having you all look at it, I can already feel that happening. So thanks, again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263702/#Comment_263702" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T12:01:09+00:00" title="March 23, 2010 12:01PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2010 12:30PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on, John.

A bunch of stormtroopers rush in, firing. What do you do? You say what, then the GM says the obstacle rating, as usual. It's independent of the previous test, mechanically -- that is, The GM doesn't automatically add 1 or anything. She judges the new circumstance and gives it an obstacle rating that's appropriate.<br/><br/>Failure is never just a failure, no. You can fail at a particular <i>task</i> (picking the lock) but you can always try other tasks to overcome the obstacle (bash down the door, squeeze through the air vent, etc). As you fail, things escalate, so you might abandon the series of tasks along the way if it gets too crazy. "Fine, I don't really want the princess that bad! The stormtroopers can keep her!"<br/><br/>The reason the game has escalation like this, is because the genre fiction that inspires it does. The heroes risk ever more to win the day, but winning is never off the table completely -- unless the heroes give up on it (which says something about what they value enough to take risks over, and what they don't).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264399/#Comment_264399" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T14:47:00+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  2:47PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like I've been handling escalation as you imagined it, John.
