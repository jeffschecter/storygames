This "shortcut" ended up producing several side effects:<br/><br/>-It was easier to state every PC action as a exchange of hits and maneuvers instead of a single attack+movement.<br/>-Action become so fast-paced that combat scenes were as fluid as roleplaying scenes. There was something happening every turn and it was not just a bad roll.<br/>-I actually had an initiative mechanic prepared for the game, but we never got to use or need it. Initiative order became almost irrelevant in mechanical terms, leaving only fictional positioning and actual player reactions to define who acted first. Turns lasted so little that players didn't care who was going first.<br/>-All I had to do was distribute the spotlight evenly so talkative players had the same chance as shy ones. Gging in clockwise order around the table worked just fine.<br/>-I didn't even needed to keep everyone at the table on hold for the monster/NPC's turn, these had their turn to act whenever PCs missed or:<br/>-I could got monster/NPCs to act anytime I felt players were getting too lucky or fiction made it appropiate; players were okay because this didn't steal their turn: it was still an exchange of blows so on a miss they could kick the enemy back.<br/><br/>Another shortcut we used solved the boring "I hit it with my axe". Players had all the tactical movements that they could think of available at any time, but as always, didn't remembered to use them. However I had hacked Dragon Age's critical table. Our dice mechanics allowed to add critical effects on both a hit or a miss, so you had a list of critical attack effects (trip, outflank, etc) as much as critical defense effects (roll with the impact, find a weak spot, etc) that you could choose from. This was enough to keep fights varied and interesting whenever player's didn't come up with that variation themselves.<br/><br/>Now, I understand this is just another way to play. I still enjoy games with less speed and more complicate mechanics as they give you time to think strategies or play with the mechanics. It isn't a matter of what systems are better in terms of time efficiency, it's just that every system is different and that's just fine. But just this time I'm looking for shortcuts between mechanics to create a game with a fast gameplay that still keeps things interesting. So how about you? What kind of shortcuts have you used in either combat or any other situation? Whose of them do you think that take away all the fun and whose do really improve it and in what way? I'm really interested in any kind of experience you had with something similar, no matter how far you think it may be.

That's where you have a vague and open question to answer, so you break the answer into the 2 most likely abstractions, roll 50-50 to see which one it is, then split that into 2 options, roll 50-50 again, etc.  This technique can be used for any type of complex decision making or to answer any creative question, from encounters to NPC details, it's context-sensitive (unlike a generic table), and it's tons faster than flipping through any book.  You do it all in your head while you roll a d6 a few times...<br/><br/>"Is the encounter friendly or unfriendly?" = 3 so friendly.<br/>"Is it magical or mundane?" = 5 so  mundane.<br/>"Is it someone the PCs know?" = 2 so yes.<br/>"Is it Jake?" = 2 so yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433178/#Comment_433178" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-29T11:14:43+00:00" title="May 29, 2014 11:14AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (That's a great way to do hit locations without the need for a table, by the way - any kind of hit location table will never be "quite right", but making a series of 50/50 calls - or 1/2/3 calls, with a Fudge die - can handle any situation believably. "You're at the bottom of the stairs, sticking the blade through that little hole? And it's about two feet long? Ok, so you'll either hit him in the foot or in the lower leg. Roll a d6... ...ah, the foot. Left or right?
