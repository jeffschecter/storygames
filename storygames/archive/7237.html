Other than that, never played before) one ex-gamer (Nick, who hasn't played at all for about 12 years), Claire, who's never played D&amp;D before plus Mat and Stuart, both of whom have played 4th ed once or twice.<br/><br/>Things I learned:<br/>* Using the edge of the battlemat to keep track of hitpoints worked really well.  When I had more than one creature on in an encounter who had hitpoints, I made sure they were all on different coloured baseplates and used a corresponding colour pen to write down the damage they'd taken.<br/>* We were playing in my kitchen, and there's a whiteboard on the wall which is usually used for shopping lists and stuff like that.  It was wonderful for tracking initiative.<br/>* Holy fuck, Rogues are badass!<br/>* If in doubt, Flank.  Kobold's "shifty" power makes them actually really damn tough.  If you're fighting two of the buggers and they survive the first round, you're pretty much guaranteed to be flanked next turn.<br/>* Fosters Twist is exactly as disgusting as it sounds.<br/>* I mean it, Rogues are pretty much pure death.<br/>* The book keeping isn't that bad, if you play smart and have lots of stuff to play with.<br/>* Don't assume that the PCs will win.  I mean, this is a newbie adventure and the first boss fight happened way before the players would have reached level 2.  It ended in a TPK, with the boss at less than 10 hp (out of a hundred-and-odd).  Had the players been luckier, or if I wasn't such a bastard in terms of tactics, or if they'd played differently or taken another extended rest, things would almost certainly have been different.<br/>* At the end of the day, I was trying to run the game exactly as written and pretty much did so.  We all had a great time: every single person has text or emailed me to ask when I'm running it again.  So yeah, it's a kick ass game.<br/><br/>Anyway, here are the photos, I know that's the only reason anyone's reading this :^)<br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/richks/DDKeepOnTheShadowfell" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://picasaweb.google.com/richks/DDKeepOnTheShadowfell</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161044/#Comment_161044" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T14:50:55+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  2:50PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, who's that Rapper guy in your group? :-D<br/><br/>A question: are those all original pieces?
