Given her deliberate non-supernatural background, I knew I was going to struggle with her Gaze into the Abyss - and didn't set what she did for that at first.<br/><br/>The game is just at the stage where she is freaking out out (she just brought the Ghost back from his Darkest Self by for once dropping her masks, trusting the writing in the mirror despite thinking she was going mad and not five minutes later ended up with the Blamed condition) and she's told me what her Gaze into the Abyss is.  She's planning on eating as much chocolate as she can and then purging.  Yes, she has a textbook eating disorder - and one I didn't intentionally give her.  I didn't understand the appeal of it before playing her and I'm picking up bleed from her and it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420043/#Comment_420043" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T09:48:44+00:00" title="August 14, 2013  9:48AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2013 9:07AM by J_Walton.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to weigh in with some hard-won expertise and dispel some common misconceptions. I have supported someone in the process of recovery for the past 5+ years, and learned a incredible amount along the way, including how terrible and misguided most treatment for eating disorders is. <br/><br/>Just FYI, eating disorders (like any form of mental illness) are complex things driven by both genetic predispositions and other factors, not just by an "appeal." The real appeal, in many or most cases, seems to be a maladaptive feedback loop created by starvation, which can cause a "runner's high," nausea, and other physical &amp; mental effects as someone's body reacts to being undernurished, over-exercised, or mistreated through other behaviors (purging, laxatives, other really dangerous things). The degree to which someone can be "high-functioning" while putting themselves through all of that seems to vary widely. The most common forms of death are suicide and organ failure (heart attacks, often) from the constant physical and emotional stress of living with the disorder.<br/><br/>Eating disorders are generally considered to be "culture-bound" illnesses, which means that -- while this genetic predisposition and mental illness has likely existed in human beings for a very long time -- it has manifested differently over the decades and centuries, based on the cultural environment that its sufferers exist in. Consequently, while modern sufferers may describe their illness as a result of wanting to be thin or wanting to punish themselves (which their psychologists and others around them may encourage, due to outdated ideas about eating disorders or mental illness), that's not really where it comes from. Sufferers in other times and places thought about their illness in different terms, such as nuns who starved themselves as a form of religious devotion in earlier centuries. Also, many men with eating disorders (who aren't as commonly recognized) experience them differently, often as a drive to over-exercise and a competitive urge to be the best.<br/><br/>If you do find that the "bleed" of the game is causing you to consider (or, worse, practice) dangerous behaviors like restricting or purging, please get the help and support you need. These are deadly serious mental illnesses and there's no knowing who has a predisposition towards one. If you have such a predisposition and end up at a low weight because of extreme dieting, over-exercise, or just an lengthy illness, that can trigger the maladaptive feedback loop that makes it hard to recover. Even if you recover, it may be something that you're living with for the rest of your life, like alcoholism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420046/#Comment_420046" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T10:40:19+00:00" title="August 14, 2013 10:40AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for posting that, Jwalt.<br/><br/>Chameleon: congratulations, you've entered dangerous territory.<br/><br/>Between last session and next, there are two things that might be a good idea: send an email to your players and make sure they're all cool with you continuing to play out this binge-and-purge cycle; spend a little time interrogating your decision to give your character an eating disorder. Was it to sensationalize such disorders? Was it out of a genuine belief that this is who your character is and this is what they struggle with? That interrogation can happen while you eat breakfast one morning, while you shop for groceries the following afternoon. Just spend a little time checking in with yourself.<br/><br/>Playing a character with a mental illness can be tricky! The key is to approach it in good faith and not fall back on unexamined stereotypes. Do a bit of research, but even more importantly: continue to treat your character like a real person, and not an amalgam of stereotypes about their disease.<br/><br/>Bleed is really powerful - it can hone our empathy and shift how we look at the world. But when it comes to an eating disorder, if that bleed threatens your eating patterns or bodily health, address the issue right away!<br/><br/>I hope this Queen continues to rock for you, and that exploring her secrets continues to be really rewarding and engrossing. It sounds like a rad character &amp; game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420052/#Comment_420052" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T10:56:15+00:00" title="August 14, 2013 10:56AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ^ This post is what I love about the community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420053/#Comment_420053" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T11:18:39+00:00" title="August 14, 2013 11:18AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">@J_Walton</a>, thanks.  <br/><br/>As I understand it (and this feels true for the character) there is another route into eating disorders and bulimia in particular other than the one you list, especially for a perfectionist.   That is the same triggers as more orthodox self-harm.  It's rarer for quite a lot of reasons and from what I know (which fortunately is nowhere near the amount of experience you have) and there are in character reasons the character wants as non-visible a form of self-harm as possible, and the loss of control that is the SI trigger has been very, very acute in the character's case.  Or possibly what she's actually doing should be technically classified as self-poisoning using emetics as a form of self-injury, and plenty of reasons (up to and including the fact the Stepford Mother would actually approve) why she chose a form of self-injury that looks like an eating disorder.\n<blockquote>If you do find that the "bleed" of the game is causing you to consider (or, worse, practice) dangerous behaviors like restricting or purging, please get the help and support you need. </blockquote>\nFor the record don't worry - I am.  Or rather I'd already booked appointments with professionals before the game started (with the underlying cause of this being due to resolve itself in a couple of months with absolutely nothing I can do to influence it in any direction), and my only normal tendency in the direction of eating disorders is comfort eating which is why I'm so amazed it's resonating.  Also were it cutting bleeding through, my answer would be "I've seen what that has done to friends of mine and helped a few through.  No way." rather than "Eep.  I'm thinking <em>what</em> thing that's utterly unlike me now?  That is <em>fascinating</em>."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420058/#Comment_420058" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T14:02:55+00:00" title="August 14, 2013  2:02PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2013 2:03PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Neonchameleon:</b> Cool. Joe says some good things above as well. Self-harm can obviously take a wide variety of forms, though I don't have any personal experiences with it resembling the behaviors associated with an eating disorder without being part of an eating disorder. It's possible, I guess. One of the weird things about mental illnesses is that they are still largely categorized by the behaviors that sufferers manifest and not by brain states or something else more based in neuroscience, so people who exhibit behaviors associated with an eating disorder are considered to have an eating disorder: that's how the disorder is defined. Hopefully someday we'll have a better understanding of such things and can make better distinctions between different things. <br/><br/>However, in terms of treatment, in my experience it doesn't really matter so much why someone is exhibiting dangerous behaviors; the most important thing is to stop the behaviors. Then, once people are physically healthy and no longer harming themselves, maybe you can deal with the underlying issues and motivations. Otherwise, though, people are in such dire physical and mental shape (and if they're purging or underweight, their meds probably aren't working properly) that they can't really control their own behavior consistently or think through their decisions and distress.<br/><br/>In any event, I hope your professionals are knowledgable and helpful. We found the vast majority of the folks working in the field, even those specializing in eating disorders, to be useless or sometimes actively unhelpful. I could tell you stories, but that's not really appropriate here. Thankfully we're finally in a better place now, but it was a long, difficult journey and she could easily have died along the way. Now part of what we want to do with our lives is help other folks not have to go through that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420074/#Comment_420074" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T19:19:00+00:00" title="August 14, 2013  7:19PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to say thank you to all three of you for this thread: it's honest and heartwrenching and educational all at once. \n<blockquote>^ This post is what I love about the community.</blockquote>\nMy thoughts exactly.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420099/#Comment_420099" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T05:22:41+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  5:22AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thread, and I learned something from it.
