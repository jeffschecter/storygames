Two games in one! And I nearly mailed them with my brilliant idea.<br/><br/>But then I thought: maybe Gen Con is too soon. I wouldn't recommend them to <i>publish</i> their game at Gen Con, would I? Just like I wouldn't encourage any Game Chef entrants to publish at Gen Con. It's just too soon to playtest and redraft it thoroughly.<br/><br/>(Obviously, if you're a brilliant game designer, you're probably be an exception. But my rule of thumb, as a consumer, is that I'm suspicious about buying a game at GenCon that was in that year's Game Chef.)<br/><br/>And I remembered the Ashcan idea: 90% chance of awesome. For your game to have a 90% chance of producing awesome play, you'd have to do a bit of playtesting and revision, surely?<br/><br/>So what's the rule of thumb? Generally, is it there enough time to turn a Game Chef game into an ashcan of sufficient standard to sell at GenCon? What about a game that's just been written? Is it too late?<br/><br/>If I've missed something important in previous ashcan threads, do point me to it. I'm mainly asking to clarify my concept of how finished an ashcan should be.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72675/#Comment_72675" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T10:25:53+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 10:25AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While Ashcan is taking on a specific meaning here in the RPG community, a lot of the comic ashcans are just there to say, "Hey, I thought this was cool and wanted to share this with you."<br/><br/>We are starting to say that an ashcan is something that is almost done and we are looking for ways to make this "Right".

I just drafted an "invitation" as the preface for my Acts of Evil ashcan that (among other things) makes it clear that the game is playtested, but not quite delivering on some design goals that are important to me. But a preface could just as easily cite optimism based on quick initial playtesting, or the need for playtesting based on design input from others.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72759/#Comment_72759" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T15:43:37+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  3:43PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2007 3:45PM by Graham.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that's pretty clear.<br/><br/>So I shouldn't be running about, waving my hands, saying "No!
