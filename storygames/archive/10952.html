You see the protagonist in their regular day, normal lives, until something happens to pull them into the action.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, it's never as fun as it looks. Especially in a one-shot or a short-term series (2-5 sessions).<br/>\n<br/>\nExample 1: We play Over the Edge. It is a one-shot, at a convention. We got pregens with cool secrets and goals. But the first hour of the game, more-or-less, is about excaping the frickin' airport. Yes, the book says the airport is a bureaucratic maze and a architectural nightmare, but who gives a damn about that when we're jonesing to bring our secrets and goals into the story. For me, the game didn't really start until we came out of the airport. This is when the game should actually have started.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample 2: We play a Call of Cthulhu campaign. In my case, only the first session. A bunch of things went wrong with that game, I think. One of them is that all of our rag-tag team of investigators are called to a mission in a south-american jungle, but instead of starting there, we start in Chicago. We have to find our boat (wait, you didn't note the name of the boat down? Tough.), we have to suffer through an excruciatingly long and pointless poker tournament on the trip, then we got some unnecessary downtime in the city... Guh.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best games start <i>In Media Res</i>. All that prologue happens before we start. We can talk about it quickly before we begin. But the we get to the action. Like in Star Wars : a bit of prologue about how we're at war and have won our first victory. And then "your ship is under attack by a much much bigger ship. You are about to be boarded. What do you do?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's part of the reason I find Poison'd to be so cool (though I have yet to play it). Prologue: the cook poisoned the captain, and now the latter's dead. The ship is in a poor state, we lack supplies and there's another ship on our tail, a warship called the Resolute. Damn! Now we have to decide how to punish the murderer (or thank him, whatev'), pick a new captain, fight off the resolute or escape it, repair the ship, get some food... That's a lot of things the PCs have to deal with pretty quick! And then all those characters start with a number of Ambitions to fulfill.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo many games depend on the characters grabbing the adventure hook. They only really work for me if the characters are invested personally in the action. A trading outpost was attacked by Apaches. Okay, what do I care? I am not a lawman. Someone I like got kille/raped/kidnapped in the attack? I care. Someone's accusing me of being responsible of the attack? I care. A posse is being built to massacre my tribe in retribution? I care. It would also have been a good idea to have us create characters with a reason to be in that outpost when it was attacked, so we start In Media Res. Do put me in danger. Do put my loved ones in danger. Do put me in front of an impossible decision (save your lover's life to the cost of thousands of unknown others').<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like kickers, and yet never got into many games that used them. Basically, a player-created hook for the characters. A device easily adapted to most games. Instead of the poor GM hurting his head trying to find way to bait the characters into the story, the characters, upon character creation, design their own story hook. "My character found Goldie, beautiful prostitute who slept with him for free, in spite of his ugly mug. The first woman to actually touch him after his mother. He woke up later, she's dead. Police cars are coming, sirens wailing outside."<br/>\n<br/>\nIn conclusion, start with a bang, in the middle of the action, get the players involved from the beginning.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243010/#Comment_243010" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T09:27:20+00:00" title="November 21, 2009  9:27AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.<br><br>I first learned the term, In Media Res, in high school or junior high english class.

Frame too close in, and its a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, etc. Going back to the source, its significant that neither did Homer start with Paris stealing off Helen (or "the double egg") but neither did he start in the middle of the fight between Hector and Achilles.<br/><br/>In other news, I often like a "cold open" type of IMR. This is where you start the game with something happening in the midst of the sound and fury, and then cut out and back to before it all went to shit and play forward until you hit the part where you started. You see this in TV shows a lot, where the part before the opening credits shows something terrible happening, and then comes the opening credits, then the obligatory "earlier that day" or "two days earlier" or whatever. It works pretty decently if you've a group that is good at working together to make the cold open scene, and then at playing together towards it. (Of course, this method introduces all sorts of elements of plot control that don't work well with emergent style narrative play. But hell, that kind of play is so 2008.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243053/#Comment_243053" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T19:02:23+00:00" title="November 21, 2009  7:02PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>You see this in TV shows a lot, where the part before the opening credits shows something terrible happening, and then comes the opening credits, then the obligatory "earlier that day" or "two days earlier" or whatever.</blockquote>\nWe're catching up on Dollhouse right now, and they used that.  However, Lisa very wisely pointed out that that only really works a few episodes in.  If we don't know the characters, we really don't give a crap about the shitstorm they find themselves in, and how they got there (though, of course, that might just be our personal preference).  So I wouldn't necessarily use that for a one-shot.

It only works for me if the players have some amount of control on the plot.<br/><br/>But then not all [i]in media res[/i] beginnings need to start in the dark. I prefer to have a prologue.<br/><br/>Star Wars: It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... <br/><br/>If I'm on that ship, and it's under attack by a much, much bigger enemy ship, and we're about to be boarded, I know how I feel about it.

And the next scene is starting the mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don't like is when we roleplaying downtime and suiting up. A few line should suffice. "Okay, we're going in a dungeon? We're taking torches, rope and rations" (or, as I prefer, we just assume we took the basic, obvious stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf our characters are travelling to another location, and the action doesn't really start before they get there, there's no point roleplaying the trip. Just narrate what's going on. And move on to the good stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd once it actually begins, let's start with a measningful scene. Let's not just be out there waiting for something to happen. If the Apaches are attacking a trading post, let's not be in a bar, waiting for someone to tell us about it. Let us be at the trading post, either being attacked, leading the attack, or after the attack, investigating the scene. If that's what's the story's going to be about, we don' need a scene when we actually decide if we want to investigate the attack, or defend the outpost.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it's more of a sandbox campaign, it works the same way, except the players decide where they are, what they are doing. My confidence artist wants to infiltrate a cult? l'll frame a scene where I'm at a meeting, getting my loyalty tested, not a scene when my character is looking for rumors about where I might find people who would no about an evil cult. My sorcerer wants to control the mayor? Instead of framing a scene where I find out how I can do that, I'll frame a scene where I'm stealing an artifact that will help me bind the right demon for the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: research and information gathering isn't that bad, really. I'm fine with a scene where my character is interrogating someone or translating an ancient book. I have problem with my character trying to find someone worthy of interrogation or reading book after book before finding the right one. I don't want to roleplay my character going from bar to bar, looking for someone to interrogate. We can juste say that happened, and jump right to the part where I'm talking to him, and he's about to spill the beans (or not).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'm rambling. What I don't want is:<br/>\n<br/>\nA scene where nothing happens, our characters have no meaningful goals yet, and the GM says "alright, what do you do?" and just muddle around for 10 minutes before a story hook kicks in. Start with the damn adventure hook, and make it juicy.

Also she noted that most of her fun in roleplaying comes from interactions with other characters when nothing is on the line (banter, joshing around, etc.) so this pretty much skips a big chunk of the fun of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243137/#Comment_243137" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T14:55:13+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  2:55PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, <br><br>This reminds me of a game I played at a con years ago. We started with hard to action IMR cut, and everyone else at the table was like "Hey, we're blowing shit up, yay!" while I was more "Hey, we're blowing shit up, yawn." For them the blowing up of shit was the point, so they were all pretty happy. For me, however, it all felt pretty pointless. I didn't know who we were blowing up, or why. And even as the facts of it became apparent, I still didn't know why I should care. <br><br>As a result, I ended up not caring. I mean, I had some mild board-game style fun with blowing shit up, but it wasn't engaging at all. The reasons folks are playing are pretty important to the ways you frame them in. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite>However, Lisa very wisely pointed out that that only really works a few episodes in.  If we don't know the characters, we really don't give a crap about the shitstorm they find themselves in, and how they got there</blockquote>\nThis is a good point, and one I agree with most of the time. However, I've had a few good experiences with this when the way you cut in tells you something about the character. That is to say, when the cold open manages to introduce both an already exploded situation and something relevant and interesting about the character at the same time. This takes some work, but games with strong flag systems and good situation generators can help a lot -- if you've already got a sense of the characters and the thing going on in the game from a generation session, then you can often work hard on those elements to set up something that works well. <br><br>Without the generation/worldbuilding/making characters together session, however, it doesn't usually work so well.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243911/#Comment_243911" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T19:27:10+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  7:27PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a big fan of this, also, especially to start off a campaign.
