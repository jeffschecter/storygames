Mostly cause I'm shy and I suck at the whole online/blog/forum thing. sorry. Anyway, I'm at a point where I need some outside playtesters for the game. You can get it here...<br/><br/><a href="http://unwrittencontinuum.com/latest-playtest/" rel="nofollow">latest playtest</a> [edit]<br/><br/>... I'm in the process of re-editing it myself right now, but its good to go for playtesting!<br/><br/>unWritten<br/>1) unWritten is a gmless, settingless game that walks the players through setting, premise, and character creation. It heavily relies on player collaboration.<br/><br/>2) The mechanics are a variant of Otherkind (by Vincent Baker) with a miniscule pinch of Shock! <br/><br/>3) The players have 2 roles, the setting player (rotating GM) and the acting player (which can include the setting players character.)<br/><br/>4) Scene framing and the types of conflicts one pushes is determined by the use of the Hero's Journey or the 3 act structure (but the 3 act structure isn't yet ready. so it isn't in the playtest.)<br/><br/>I've already playtested it several times with great results, my group has thoroughly enjoyed it. Additionally, Joshua BishopRoby, Judson Nestor, and Mark Vallianatos have also played it, apparently with great success. I haven't heard back from Josh or Judson yet, but Mark has given me some feedback that I'm dealing with now. But, the changes aren't in the current playtest just yet.<br/><br/>I'll be playtesting it with another group next Sunday (the 18th?) and I'll be running it 3 times during Gateway in LA.<br/><br/>The main thing I'm concerned about right now is the fact that, I'm not sure if what my group is doing is actually in the text, though like I said, JBR, JN, and MV had fun with it...<br/><br/>So, I'd appreciate any help I can get.<br/><br/>Thanks Alex                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87755/#Comment_87755" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-13T09:03:24+00:00" title="August 13, 2007  9:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to give this some thread-bump love, folks, this is a <em>sweet</em> little design, and a really fun game.

A couple of things really. <br/><br/>1) How do the setting questions work for you?

I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve gotten great insights from all three, however, one of them was a terrible play experience.<br/><br/>The first one was with my son and girlfriend. My girlfriend is committed to hating RPG\xe2\u20ac\u2122s and my son compares everything to D&amp;D\xe2\u20ac\xa6 It was late, everyone was tired\xe2\u20ac\xa6 it was terrible. But I figured out some things that I can do to streamline some of the more bulky processes, and I was able to identify somewhere in text where there was a problem\xe2\u20ac\xa6 I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t fix it until I has some pretty indepth conversations with some friends from my regular gaming group that will be continuing.<br/><br/>The second was with my regular Saturday gaming group, Greg, Brendon, and I. The setting creation was amazing, however the play was lacking and I couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t figure out why until the third playtest\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/><br/>The third playtest was with my other regular group, that as of today is no more\xe2\u20ac\xa6 Bye Carla! Anyway, in this game we did a one shot and I realized that the hero\xe2\u20ac\u2122s journey mechanic wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t yet complete and there is one protagonist question that with a slight tweaking totally changes the answer it provieds. Which in both instances if they were implemented in my second game it would have made the game awesome!<br/><br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll post actual plays within a week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
