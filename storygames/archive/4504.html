We made our characters and they fit into the problems of the town.  I'm not sure its necessary but it surely didn't hurt. </i><br/><br/><b>How I started the Burning Wheel Orcs game over skype</b>:<br/>1) Propose situation -Orcs trapped in elven lands after the decimation of their horde- to players, full well knowing the two guys and knowing that I was hitting on something that they'd dig.<br/>2) E-mail back and forth and skype with players during chargen, going over thoughts on orcish culture and setting bits to give them hand-holds for Beliefs and such.  This where I both got their villains and made situations up, all over the map.  Eventually, I had my buddy, Storn, make a map up for us that was really vital in the players' deciding what to do next and when throughout the campaign.  Maps = POWERful tools.<br/>3) Go over Beliefs, make sure they are strong and worthwhile.<br/>4) Play.<br/><br/><i>Thoughts: I really love this method of GMing, starting with a vague idea and situation, fleshing it out as the characters come to be.  Once play starts, things get firmed up and there isn't so much collaborative hippie wiggle but at that point, everyone's waist deep in the fun-muck and enjoying it.</i><br/><br/><b>Dictionary of Mu at cons</b>:<br/>1) Read pre-made kickers out loud<br/>2) Hand out characters based on the player's digging the kicker<br/>3) Make sure everyone is invested in their characters with some last minute trading or talking.<br/>4) Everyone reads their character sheets and two dictionary entries.<br/>5) Play, paying particular attention to weaving players various kickers that start them all over the planet into one another, so that if they should want to meet, they can.<br/><br/><i>Thoughts: This came from me wanting to play Sorcerer at cons, even though, in my experience, it is a game that really heats up but good during the second and third sessions.  I've had some kick-ass sessions at cons but I could tell that the next two games of that campaign would have graduated from kick-ass to absolutely legendary and I'm not sure what to do with that.</i><br/><br/><b>PTA at cons</b>:<br/>1) Come to the table with no ideas at all.<br/>2) Explain to the players that we are going to take some time to brainstorm a TV show idea and it will be a bit frustrating but when we're done, we'll have a show idea and a game concept that we'll all be really excited about.<br/>3) Brainstorm with the table for a while and just when it get's good and frustrating, something has always clicked and we end up with an idea that get's everyone sitting up and engaged.<br/>4) Play like hell.<br/><br/><i>Thoughts: Man, there is that terrible and awful thought that some day that click won't come but it hasn't happened yet.</i><br/><br/><b>Conspiracy of Shadows ala Pirates</b>:<br/>1) My friend, Paula asks me what system I'd use for a pirate game.<br/>2) I mull it over for a few weeks, e-mailing back and forth with her and brainstorming over forums.<br/>3) Propose Conspiracy of Shadows to the group and they all dig it.<br/>4) Make up characters, tying their PC's to the conspiracy and deciding on their roles on the ship.  This is where I got my villains, off of the players' character sheets.<br/>5) Play!<br/><br/><i>Thoughts: Sometimes, just raising the ole jolly roger and saying, "I'm playing this game, its going to be about this and we're playing on Saturday; let's go!" is the way to roll.  I've seen plenty of groups get stalled just sitting and deciding what the hell to play (but that's another thread, I reckon).</i><br/><br/><b>What do you want out of this thread, Judd?</b><br/><br/>Great question, Judd!<br/><br/>I'd like to discuss our methods for starting a game, particularly, what you, as the GM, make up and when.  GM-less games are fine too, those procedures are important.<br/><br/>Also, I'd like us to ask questions about our own procedures and try to refine what it is that we do when we play.  I think player procedures might be cool too.  Might be another thread and might not, I dunno.<br/><br/>So...questions about the above and your own gaming procedures would be neat.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102074/#Comment_102074" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T15:04:21+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  3:04PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd,<br/><br/>In your Orcs example, what actually happened at the table when play started?<br/><br/>I mean kind of literally, not so literally as in "Bob picked up a pencil, Tina spilt some coke on the floor" but as in how did play actually get going once you'd all done that work together prior to play.<br/><br/>You have beliefs, maps, a great situation, you sit down and if I read it right you do not have a plot however one defines it because you don't need one, so what actually happened when play started?

That way they are invested in the opening scene and situation.<br/><br/>While they read over the characters, I watch 'em and see who is nodding their head and who is laughing or chuckling or awesome-ing.  I start with the person who makes the most ruckus, because I reckon they are the ones who know exactly what they want to do and I go around the table towards the person who seems the most tentative, so they get an idea of the feel of the world and how the game works.<br/><br/>My blurbs mention the game's inspirations and some flavor text with a pulp fantasy flavah.<br/><br/>I did have one gamer come to the table and sign up to play because he saw a picture of the Kid with a Rock at Jen's art booth and said, "Man, I like that guy!" and she pointed him at my game.  With that in mind, I definitely just handed him the Kid with a Rock when we started play, explaining to everyone why.  It was also neat because he was the youngest at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102093/#Comment_102093" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T15:53:12+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  3:53PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the <b>Beast Hunters</b> game I just ran on Saturday:<br/><br/>1) We emailed and LJ'ed about the game night and what people wanted to play; there was enough interest in BH that I offered to run it<br/>2) I offered for people to make their own characters or use pregens, and pointed to the free chapter with character creation rules<br/>3) I prepared for 30 minutes by making up the situation and beast, statting four threats, and making sure the environment had enough usable features<br/>4) When we got together, I handed out 4 pregens to choose from for Tim and Joel (Dave had made his own character)<br/>5) I handed out rules summary sheets and explained the rules<br/>6) Salute in<br/>7) Play<br/><br/><i>Thoughts: Because this was a one-shot, putting the characters right at the showdown worked very well.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102094/#Comment_102094" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T15:59:36+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  3:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>Judd, excellent.<br/><br/>Can I add an interesting example from a 1 hour Polaris con game recently?</blockquote>\nAye Joe, neat example.<br/><br/>I played Polaris at a con and we made characters right there and then.

The section on Playing the Challenger in the book is pretty much the essence of what I do for prepping. Since the game is all about the challenges and allowing the Hunter to be creative and come up with cool shit, the challenges need to have a good amount of potential for that. <br/><br/>At its core, we're talking about Gamist Bangs here. Where Narrativist Bangs present meaningful choices for the player within a situation that's thematically charged, Gamist Bangs present meaningful choices by providing tough adversity and a big toolbox of things to use to overcome it.<br/><br/>The first thing I do is to look over the Hunter's character sheet. See how I can tie those things into interesting and challenging situations. The Hunt you're running will be about stalking the Beast, but that doesn't mean there can't be subplots going on at the same time, like the tribal dispute you're talking about. Pick some of the elements from Bret's sheet and weave them into a charged situation where you know the Hunter will be able to affect change. It's a good thing if these subplots are somehow in the way of reaching the Beast.<br/><br/>Then I think about some particular challenges that the Hunter could encounter. I try to envision the environment for the challenge and neat elements that could be used. This is easiest with a physical challenge: for the Spider-God cave, I made sure that there were burning pyres, hanging roots, huge spiderwebs, underground steam eruptions, rudimentary and crumbling temples, and so on. All things that could be (and were) used in creative ways in the physical challenge. Location maps help sometimes, but I didn't have one in this case. At the same time, remember that it's perfectly fine to bring in non-physical things into a physical challenge: passions, doubts, glory on the line, and so on.<br/><br/>For social challenges, you need a social environment: enmities, secret romances, power structures, alliances, insecurities, ambitions, and so on. That environment needs to be known to the Hunter so that he can make use of its parts just like in a physical challenge. Conflict webs/R-maps or something similar might help here. Think of it as a Dogs town where the goal is not to "solve/judge" it but to <i>leverage</i> the existing tensions for the Hunter's goals.<br/><br/>For mental challenges, it depends on the type of what they are. If it's a test of willpower, there need to be things that impact the character's will. The key to those is usually in the character sheet. For more investigative or cunning challenges (a tracking duel, outmaneuvering pursuers, etc.), there also needs to be an environment that can be used.<br/><br/>The thing that keeps prep manageable here is that I'm not actually (usually) assigning any stats to these challenges. I just make up some potent venues and key players. Then I see which ones the player marches into and create the adversity appropriately on the fly. (With demos it's a bit different, so I stat them in advance.)<br/><br/>We could bounce around some specific ideas for Bret, if you want, but we might want to do it in whispers <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102266/#Comment_102266" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T11:25:26+00:00" title="October 10, 2007 11:25AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>We could bounce around some specific ideas for Bret, if you want, but we might want to do it in whispers <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nI'm reading through the book again now.<br/><br/>I'm fine, thanks, no whispering needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102280/#Comment_102280" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T11:47:38+00:00" title="October 10, 2007 11:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Different games require different degrees of prep. My rule of thumb when kicking off a session or new game is to come to the table with:<br/><br/>1) A narrative bang that engages every character (or one for each character)<br/>2) A way to tie every bang to mechanics<br/>3) A willingness to cede the reins to any other player if they introduce a bang that engages them better<br/><br/>I'm trying now to do the same thing when I come to the table as a player.<br/><br/>This method seems to be giving me different mileage with different games.<br/><br/>When I set up a TSOY or Principia one-shot, I start with a situation that presents a choice to all the PCs (narrative bang), with each PC having a key that lets them get XP for making a choice (link to mechanics). If it's principia, then I add a question that shows a link between making a choice and an issue related to the larger story.<br/><br/>A really simple example is a D&amp;D set up where all the PCs are in a situation where they to quickly co-operate to defeat a monster (and get XP for it).<br/><br/>One game where I ran into trouble was In a Wicked Age. This game doesn't let you come to the table with prep. Here's what we did playing IAWA when I GM'ed, and the problem I ran into:<br/><br/>1) Draw some story hooks from the oracle<br/>2) Use them to create characters with crossed-interests<br/>3) Players choose character, GM gets the rest<br/>4) GM tries to set a scene that cuts to the heart of these crossed interests.<br/>5) Players get into the story and the GM joins in using the NPCs under his control<br/><br/>Step 4 tripped me up. What I was missing was the narrative bang. I find it really hard to create this at the table. Once the story gets rolling, I find it much easier. I'm not sure if this is a skill I need to work on, or if there's a procedural step that I'm missing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102332/#Comment_102332" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T15:50:29+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  3:50PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2007 3:51PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am in no way an expert at GMing Wicked.

I've had thoughts along these lines going through my head, after reading through (ok, sometimes skimming through) the "GM writes the plot" thread. What I'm going to do with my post is look at how I prepped games in different periods of my gaming life.<br/><br/><b>How I GMed D&amp;D, Gamma World, Traveler, &amp; other RPGs back in junior high:</b><br/>I'd create a location (a dungeon, a ruined city, a planet or spaceport, whatever) and throw in as much cool stuff--cool monsters, cool traps, cool treasure, cool secret rooms, cool NPCs, gateways to weird dimensions--with the idea that wherever the PCs went, whatever the PCs did, they would encounter cool stuff. There was no plot, no idea of what should happen. Just a setting loaded with kewl.<br/><br/><i>Thoughts: I always had fun doing this kind of prep, excited about what would happen when the PCs encountered all of the cool things I was putting in the dungeon/city/spaceport/whatever. And we generally did have a lot of fun when we played. We never took the gaming all that seriously, but we had a good time.</i><br/><br/><b>How I GMed Doctor Who in high school:</b><br/>Using either the homemade system I created with my brother and step-brother or the official FASA game that came out soon after we made our own game, I would plot out a full "season" of stories, with ideas for companions joining or leaving. We would only end up playing a few stories from any particular "season," and we tended to skip around through "seasons." For an individual story, I'd come up with a setting (usually historical Earth or future space opera) and a basic situation. There was often a mystery to be solved, but the mystery was incredibly basic, and I put all of the clues right in front of the players. Once they figured out what was going on, the rest of the story was spent resolving conflicts and fighting monsters.<br/><br/><i>Thoughts: I see this as the beginning of my slide into "GM writes the plot," although these games still ended up being almost entirely played by winging it and trying to keep up with the players as they did whatever they wanted. And we had a lot of fun playing.</i><br/><br/><b>How I GMed White Wolf games in college:</b><br/>I'd spend a lot of time writing out plot outlines for long, epic chronicles (heavily inspired by the story structure of Neil Gaiman's <i>Sandman</i>, which was just becoming a popular comic at the time. For the Vampire chronicle I tried to get going, I plotted out how the PCs' Sires would all be slain by a vampire hunter, and they would be rescued by some benevolent vampire, who would serve as a mentor for them. I played some heavily railroaded preludes with two friends, but the rest of the game never got off the ground. For the Werewolf chronicle I ran, I sketched out a long sequence of stories, plotting out how the PCs would start by being introduced to the basic world of the game, and then the faeries would give them a magical artifact to watch over, which would eventually become extremely significant as they faced off against a Wyrm-fueled apocalypse that they could not defeat, and if this is starting to sound like I was playing before we played...boy, was I ever! In the shorter term, I would come up with some antagonists and the things the PCs needed to do, including who they needed to talk to and in what order, to defeat the bad guys. After a few sessions, the game fell apart.<br/><br/><i>Thoughts: I had a lot of fun prepping for these games, but not a lot of fun running them. I was extremely bad in anticipating what the players would actually do, so the players and I would all get frustrated as they failed to follow my plot and I failed to let them actually do anything besides follow my plot. My other friends were often running games the same way, and I rarely had fun playing them. And yet, it would be years before I would really understand why I wasn't having fun.</i><br/><br/><b>How I GMed HeroQuest:</b><br/>I've run short 6-or-so-session games for HeroQuest three times now. Each time, I picked a setting, created a bunch of NPCs in conflict, and had them actively recruit the PCs to help in the conflict. I would write up a list of bangs for each session and pull a bang out when it felt right. Other than that, I winged it.<br/><i>Thoughts: these games were more fun than the games I ran in college, but it was still kind of hit-&amp;-miss for me. In retrospect, I think that even with bangs--rather than full-on railroady plotting--I get too attached to events occuring in a certain way, which leads me to use NPCs to force PCs one way or another. And when I try to force events one way or another, or when I have that done to me by a GM, I end up feeling very frustrated and dissatisfied with play.</i><br/><br/>My conclusion from all of this is that the best play for me is with games where either you can't possibly force a particular story (with games like Capes, Breaking the Ice, My Life With Master, InSpectres) or the prep is simply "setting + antagonistic NPCs," like an old-school D&amp;D dungeon (like Dogs in the Vineyard, The Princes' Kingdom, Trollbabe). Which is why the phrase "GM writes the plot" gives me the shivering whimwhams.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102358/#Comment_102358" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T19:40:57+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  7:40PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I am in no way an expert at GMing Wicked.

Most recently it was my housemates and we just didn't gel and that's fine and cool.  </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111059/#Comment_111059" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T00:20:45+00:00" title="December  2, 2007 12:20AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How I run GURPS.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

Most of the gaming I've done was with people I already knew; an assortment of friends and roommates and coworkers and I would just sort of fall together, through no fault of our own, into a gaming group. (And then they'd make me DM. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ) <br/><br/>I learned a lot from the experience with the last group, so if and when I get another one together there's a lot of things I'm going to approach differently. I think the <i>main</i> one is that it's not going to be about getting together and playing in Ron's long term D&amp;D campaign. We're going to be getting together to play games. One of those games might be D&amp;D and one of the things we might do with D&amp;D is play a longer-term game, but I'm not making that the focus. I'm just really not into the long-term campaign stuff anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111607/#Comment_111607" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T10:21:44+00:00" title="December  4, 2007 10:21AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite><br/><br/>Admitted to remaining players at third session that the adventure sucked and that I wasn't having any fun.

One requirement was that they had to make characters which would be "movers and shakers" on the Galactic level (to fit my railro--uh, plot).<br/>* Met for first session, presented the plot hook--each was a representative (or associate of a rep) of their planet at a major conference to resolve the "Problem of Emerging Galactic Sentience and its Effects on Psy Industries".<br/>* Interesting philosophical debates ensue, along with some serious loophole-poking (ex: why are we traveling physically, if The Net can use Instant Communication between stars?).<br/><br/>Game ended in one session, as we basically "talked out" the whole story arc I had planned without ever rolling a die or even framing a scene. Fun? Yes. A game? I'd say no.<br/><br/><b>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying</b><br/>* Pitched the system ("Old skool hack and slash! Faster than D&amp;D, for sure!").<br/>* Folks made various characters, with the provision that each had to (for some reason) be working for a traveling circus.<br/>* I drafted an overarching story, with episodes aligned (roughly) with sessions. I made a point of "pinging" a different aspect of play with each episode:<br/>-- The first was a bit of "investigation," a chase scene, and (believe it or not) a shopping scene ("time to equip the characters!"). Yeah... ugh on that last bit, eh?<br/>-- The second was a massive attack on the circus's wagon train (i.e. a bunch of crunchy combat and feats of daring-do)... BUT, I *had* to destroy the circus as a viable focus of activity for the characters, to fit my railro--uh, plot. Most didn't seem to mind, but one player felt like it was a bit of a bait &amp; switch (she'd made a character with a lot of ties to the circus and whose major ability focuses were far more social than combative--I knew this would be fine in the long run, but she didn't).<br/>-- The third was *supposed* to be the "spur" session, where the party is mostly stranded out in the wilds between towns, they got attacked for no (apparent) reason--another "investigation" hook--and one way or the other, they were to be aimed squarely at The Pending Threat (a Chaos invasion). What threat this circus was to said invasion, I hadn't worked out yet... but I was hunting character sheets for hooks or, at worst, I was ready to treat its destruction as either (a) an opportunity for the vanguard of the invasion to remain unreported or (b) confusion by the vanguard (thinking this was more of a supply train than a circus--Chaos warriors wouldn't think of the colorfully painted wagons as "whimsical," right? No, they *must* be so painted to throw off any potential bandits! Eh, whatever...).<br/><br/>But the third never finished--everyone was going glassy-eyed before I could even show them the nice shiny hook I planned to sink deep in their craws, to drag them down the railroad.<br/><br/>These days... I only do either "pregnant" relationship/faction maps which will blow up without the players' interceding, and then I throw them straight into the soup; or I play GMless (mainly <i>Universalis</i> or highly competitive Clix with a thin situation; i.e. a dungeon crawl or field battle).<br/><br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111628/#Comment_111628" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T11:29:43+00:00" title="December  4, 2007 11:29AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Do you think the problems with players having to leave and personality conflicts were at all effected by the games themselves being frustrating?</blockquote>\nI don't think they did to any great extent. One guy had to drop out because his wife's work schedule changed and he had to take over driving their kid to whatever kind of thing you drive kids to. The one I kicked out was totally an out of game problem. He was lot younger than everyone else and I think was just acting like a jerk to get attention. Which was annoying but tolerable when he was just being the rules-lawyering, power-gaming sort of jerk but became <i>wholly unacceptable</i> when he escalated to passive aggressive expressions of homophobia toward the lesbian couple in the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111630/#Comment_111630" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T11:32:49+00:00" title="December  4, 2007 11:32AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>Which was annoying but tolerable when he was just being the rules-lawyering, power-gaming sort of jerk but became<i>wholly unacceptable</i>when he escalated to....</blockquote>\nGotcha.

Met someone online who was into playing indie games, jazzed about stuff I was jazzed about.<br/>2. Roped in a coworker who's a gamer, but hasn't played on RPG in a long, long time. But has heard about stuff like Grey Ranks, and Shaba iri Roach, and owned a copy of Primetime Adventures that he wanted to play a game of.<br/>3. Brainstormed a show, ran out of time due to general tiredness.<br/>4. Got my neighbor into the idea of gaming (he only played D&amp;D a few times, like 12 years ago) right before our next session, and had him make a PTA character to slide into our yet unaired pilot.<br/>5. My coworker couldn't make it, so instead of PTA, we played another indie game instead (A Penny For My Thoughts).<br/>6. Third session, coworker couldn't make it, so instead of PTA we played another "idea" game (Wild Talents).<br/>7. Decided that we like playing all sorts of games, so we officially made it our "dirty hippie indie game" group, instead of the idea that we're a PTA group. So we plan to play games that require little to no prep, to reduce any instances of "Okay, we're done making characters.  See you next time!"<br/>8. A longer term plan is to eventually settle into one or two or however many games for more longer term play. We're looking towards HeroQuest and Spirit of the Century, but who knows what it will end up being.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
