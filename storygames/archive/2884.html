Here's the real cranker...<br/><br/>I have been running a LARP for the last four months that I built by smashing ideas I have on improv together with a fair chunk of indie-style gaming stuff.  It has received almost obscenely positive reviews locally by word-of-mouth among LARPers.<br/><br/>I PDF'ed the rules a week or so ago.  Nobody has shown a willingness or a capacity, outside of a couple guys on RPGnet, to step up and shitkick the rules, the layout, the advertising - and I *KNOW* that the whole package desperately needs to get the crap mercilessly beaten out of it by people capable of doing so.  It is not as good as it could be, and I originally assumed that I would be running a little 'tester' game, which would eventually collapse - something I have done many, many times, learning new things each time.<br/><br/>It isn't collapsing.  If anything, I'm certain I can step up and help it grow.  A lot.  I'm just about ready to start "marketing" it locally with posters, cards, you-name-it.  Next game, the players are already expecting a rules revision and a full set of written rules, rather than the current "draft" set.  <br/><br/>I do not need encouragement.  I need constructive brutality.<br/><br/>Everything for the game is here; everything is open to criticism and suggestions:<br/><br/><a href="http://dustbowl-prophets.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dustbowl-prophets.blogspot.com/</a><br/><br/>I have sixteen days until next event.  <br/><br/>Please, kick my ass.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65424/#Comment_65424" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T06:53:05+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  6:53AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Levi,<br/><br/>I don't know fuck all about LARPs. All I can offer for LARP advice is enthusiasm for color. I'd like to help you, but I would be talking out of my ass. Really, go ask a LARP community.<br/><br/>(Brutal!)<br/><br/>Hey, the web site you've put together is pretty approachable. Not too much shit to digest. I have no idea how well it maps to the actual game experience you want, but it certainly gives me some idea what this game might be about.<br/><br/>Your choice of fonts seems anachronistic for 1937. Not necessarily a bad thing, but you might want to give it a look with vintage typefaces and see if making the text actually look like an artefact of the era is more effective. If people can simply look at the typeface and subliminally understand "This has something to do with the Great Depression," that would rock. (Hint: <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropFonts.html" rel="nofollow">HPLHS</a>)<br/><br/>Does this game involve magic or the supernatural?

It's time for bed. It may be a few days before I can set the time to rewrite my comments. Which is no big deal, as they are mostly minor to medium flaws. However there is one huge gapping flaw. Your resolution system does not address more than one challenger, and one defender. Five or ten people in a challenge and stake setting before hand is going to be incredibly burdensome. I'd recommend stating simple goals of intent and resolving conflicts after the token trade. Speaking of which how will token trading work with multiple people?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Martin%20O%27Leary" title="Martin O'Leary"><img alt="Martin O'Leary" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Martin%20O%27Leary">Martin O'Leary</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65463/#Comment_65463" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T08:55:32+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  8:55AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So a while back, I was tossing some ideas around for a vaguely story-game-ish LARP (with an Arthurian setting), but never really got anywhere. Now I come and see that Levi has obviously broken into my house, deciphered my scribbled notes, taken my ideas and made them good.<br>\n<br>\nSo yes, it looks good. Now for the brutality.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresentation: The website need some explanatory text on the front page; you have to dig around a bit to find out what's going on. Similarly, if you're going to put rules on the web, put rules on the web. Don't mess around with PDFs. I'll second Larry's typeface comments as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRules: Questions! What's the difference between a Boon and a Panoply? Why is there a distinction? How do I know what Taints or Vices someone has? Do tokens accrue to players or to characters? How do "grey" characters work in challenges?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to be hiding some of the rules and setting from the players. This seems somewhat condescending, although I understand it is standard practice. Even if the archetype escalation is unique for each player, it would help to have some examples, so that the player has some idea what they're in for. In fact, examples would be useful just about everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stakes negotiation seems quite badly defined, and likely to bog down play, or at least introduce significant handling time. Have you considered a ritualised structure to this? Something like the Key Phrases from Polaris could work extremely well in a LARP context.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65487/#Comment_65487" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T10:34:36+00:00" title="April 26, 2007 10:34AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will look at it over the weekend, Levi (amidst my own deadlines).

You use the term set in reference to the furniture, for instance...<br/>\n<br/>\n- You have some unreferenced terms. "Big Sheet" is used early on without reference to where it is later, as is "Rule of Grey." Either find a way to introduce these before using them or, if that's not possible, put in a page reference and perhaps mention that it will be explained later. Otherwise the reader has to worry that they missed something. (I'm avoiding editing notes, generally, but this is a semi-design issue - order of text matters to how it's perceived). As another example, Tokens are tossed in just because they rules suddenly become hard to understand if they've not been explained at one point. They should be explained way before then.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Pick Up Characters. If the scene is closed, and has pick-up characters listed, can I enter by taking a pick-up character? The rule expressly says that I can enter if I take on a pick up character. But this contradicts the "closed" rule. Or will it never happen that there is a sign with both "closed" on it and pick up characters listed? This needs to be clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n- What's the big white sheet supposed to indicate? Will we have an idea of what the covered items are from the sign or something? I think by "furniture" you mean that these can simulate any in-game object in the scene, right? That's not clear. Sounds like you can't put in cars... because they're not furniture. Even if you use furniture to simulate one.<br/>\n<br/>\n- "That's Lame" - I'm all for the honesty, but... why such a judgmental term? That is, players will probably have a natural automatic reaction to the term if it ever gets used. If, instead, they say "Exception!" or something (I avoided saying Challenge, but that could work, too), then the player knows that he's not being criticized personally, but just being held up to the community standard being set up. ... Fine, I could be just beeing a tad touchy-feely here.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The last sentence of "That's Lame" says that there's one rule that's inviolate. This is a big loophole. Do you intend for all the other rules to be susceptible to "That's Lame?" I think the idea that you're conveying is that it's only player choices that can be declared lame? Not how the rules are used? Anything else is asking for trouble, it seems to me. Like em or not, agreeing to play is agreeing to use the rules, and that has to remain rock solid.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rule of Black/Grey - If you're not in costume, how do I know who you are? Are there nametags or such? If I'm not supposed to start out knowing, and you're in black, won't I be missing significant cues? Don't players need yellow stickies on them, too, or something? If in Grey, it's even worse... with black I can learn who you are, and respond to the player by their face identifiing with character they're playing. In Grey, they could be many people. That needs to be clear. I'm betting you're using something, but it's not in the rules that I can see.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Big Board - any rules for determining if a player's character knows a particular item on the board? Just common sense? What if it's ambiguous? Can a player just decides that his character has heard the news? "Hey, I overheard some of the townfolk saying that you've got a thing for Sallie Mae. Zat true?" More to the point, if there's some undisclosed supernatural thing going on with an NPC, can a player establish what it is? "You know how Jasper keeps dissapearin? Well I saw him last night, and he just rose up straight into the sky with nothin' holdin' him up. Never seen anythin' like it." Basically how much Director Stance Authority do they have, and how do they know? There's some explicit power given in "Character Surrounds" so it's an open issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Boons/Panoplies/Vices/Relationships - two of seven for each of these? Is there some mechanical rationale for this? Or just some sort of balance? It's been my observation before that adherence to this sort of symmetry, if it's just for symmetry's sake, is a bad idea. It means sometimes forcing in bad options just to round out, or excluding good options just because it would make one too many.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Advancement? - You probably shouldn't explain the lack of such mechanics at all. If you absolutely have to, then tell the truth. The game is not about these characters becoming more powerful in game-mechanical terms. The Eldrich stuff notwithstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ascendant - We'll know it when we see it? Rather there seems to be a gap here that you haven't gotten around to explaining? I mean, I can understand if you want to keep it secret from the players (lord knows I've designed that way). But, for design review at least, it would be good for us to know. To say nothing of publishing this so others can use it (if that's at all an intent).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Relationships... at first it sounds like "escalation" means changing type of relationship, until you get into the descriptions and find out that each has it's own escalation criteria. This could be more clear up front.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Can relationships be filled with Pick up characters? It would work, the player playing the pick-up character making the reward decisions. But are you trying to avoid this?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Unlikely though it may be, what happens if a player runs out of tokens through having tied a lot? Do they just throw zero until they get more?<br/>\n<br/>\n- IT seems to me that the difference between the levels of conditions (Minor, Serious, Absolute) is all about duration. Minor = do something until the end of the scene. Serious = do something tonight, even if it takes going to another scene. Absolute = always be this way going forward. Is that an accurate summary?<br/>\n<br/>\n- How do players know what conditions other players have on them? How can I make a Serious condition if I'm not aware of their Minor Conditions? Does a player need the Perspicacity Boon to pick up on this, or can one just guess? Will info like this be in the gossip deck? If I overhear somebody getting a condition, is that OK to use? Even if my character doesn't know it? Some serious questions about Player/Character knowledge separation here, and what the policy is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore below...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65497/#Comment_65497" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T11:01:22+00:00" title="April 26, 2007 11:01AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continuing...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Advice Boon - is this just on the honor method? "Oh, Roy gave me an advice boon against you, this counts as three, not two." Or is advice recorded somewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Aid Boon - it's very suscinctly stated, and I'm pretty sure I have it. But almost too suscinct - it might leave some readers unsure. "...count and are exchanged normally" isn't quite good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Corruption Boon - generally the terminology around vices seems inconsistent and non-intuitive. "Off/on" "Active/inactive" etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Healing - why not allow ressurection? Players won't be killed (due to the Lame rule), if they don't want to be. They won't, then, be ressurected either, unless they want to be. The term "event" here means "session" correct? As opposed to "series" which means the entire game including all "events". You could make a healing boon burn out for the night with serious, and forever with Absolute...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ingratiation Boon - can the player negotiate for the sort of relationship? "I'll only set this up if you make me your Ward." Can such a deal be enforced? Or can the player who accepts the tokens decide to make the character in the example Anathema? Won't that tend to temper the use of the ability too much, if so?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Panoplies - It took me a while to get it. You have two panoplies. They allow you to purchase cards for two tokens. These cards are then used up at some point, when you invoke them, correct? OK, why create a card before you need it? Let's say I want to get some gossip... why create the card until I'm going to burn it? Why create a gun before I want to use it to fuel a curse with Ritual? If, however, the player was only allowed to create these between scenes... that might work.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Use em or lose em - so, at the end of the night, every player cashes in all of their tokens for cards based on their panoplies, right? Why wouldn't they? Won't that lead to lots of cards at the beginning of each session? Like around three per player?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Gossip Panoply - Does gossip so created by a player have to be true (looks like no, according to Lore)? Who creates gossip other than the players (if nobody, then the first person to use the Panoply has nothing to draw)? If a bit of gossip becomes common knowledge, is it taken out of the deck (or does drawing it just mean tough luck)? What if I draw my own gossip? Do I get to draw again, or tough luck? If the latter, that gives players disincentive to make gossip cards. Are the cards shuffled when returned? Or do they go to the bottom of the deck? In what order?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lore Panoply - can the player ask about characters? Or are they not what you mean by "the world?" If it's not about characters, then this sounds a tad weak. What's important other than who is where, or has done what, or knows what, etc, etc? Any mechanical effects for such knowledge? You could create something like "World Conditions" (Global Conditions is what the programmer in me wants to call them), and these could always be leveraged off of to create worse conditions. That would be a use for Lore.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ritual Panoply - The term is "Fetish." I like the idea of creating a drink to use to corrupt an alcoholic character. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Travel Panoply - the "street scene" rule should be mentioned under scenes in terms of getting back and forth between them. It's a surprise to find that rule here in the exception to the rule. Worse... are you sure you're not creating this rule in order to make a boon out of travel? That is, penalizing everybody else playing just so that the 28% with the travel boon will have some advantage over them? Or is forcing street scenes good for play? Even if no other players are in the street scene?<br/>\n<br/>\n- More generally, how do you handle the passage of time? Can a scene be set "tomorrow"? Are there ever problems with characters being out of synch in terms of time?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Utility Panoply - hmm. Spend two tokens, get a gun to fuel Curse. Then spend the gun to fuel it... which would otherwise have cost two tokens... Same with most of the rest.. well for Aid, I assume that it counts as a two token Aid. For minor healing or minor aid it would be a bad deal.. better to pay directly. It's really only a bargain for major healing. So... the only use here is storing up charges between sessions (per my Use em or Lose em comment above)? Shouldn't this be a bargain?<br/>\n<br/>\n- War Panoply - Aha, here we have our example of the global condition. Or a temporarily infectious one or something. Why not make it like "Dominance Panoply" and allow players to define it. So, for instance, a player could create "blackmail photos" which would be a minor condition under the right circumstances. OTOH, in many ways this is just like cursing, even with the same cost. But I'd avoid a combat specific one, unless you want more fighting than is strictly "natural."<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wealth Panoply - you take any two tokens, and make them into a Red token. Presumably one would only do this with white tokens, after all, so why not say that, and make it clear that this is what it's for? That said, now I'm really confused... why would one want red tokens if they're usable less often than white ones? According to the rule in Tokens, the red ones can only be used when the vices are turned off.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Vices - I'm missing something, I'm sure I am. The whole thing just doesn't make sense as written. I sense that there's a cool functional system in there... I'm just not getting it. I'm thinking it's that you can use red chips always, and white only when your character has addressed their vices (either by playing to them, or shutting them off, I'm not sure - both are interesting). Basically rewarding a player to deal with his vices in some way in order to get the power of some other sort of token. But this all needs to be much more clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Hatred Vice - this is the only ability in the game that requires another ability. Worse, if you ever resolve all of your anathema or rivals, the rule no longer has any effect. (not that I'm sure what effect it's supposed to have...)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lust, Insecurity, Heirarchy - All have same problem as Hatred (only worse with Lust, as there's only one relationship it affects). Can vices change if they're "switched off?" That would help... Otherwise these vices limit which relationships a player is likely to have for their character.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's just what I get from a read-through. It looks pretty cool.

Here's things that were MOST FOGGY for me:<br><br>Vices, do i want them on or off? <br>Is there an OOG entity (host, organizer, story commitee) who fills out gossip cards? Answers lore questions?<br>Whats the deal with archetype escalation, its totally unclear in my head, and i don't see what it does or is for.<br>What do red tokens do? It looks like nothing, except fill pockets and not get used a lot.<br>If I have to move through a street scene for 5 min and no one is there with me, i'm going to be really bored. I don't ever want to be bored.<br>It looks like giving people new vices is used to punish them, but having more vices seems helpful. Do i ever resolve away vices or do they stick with me till the end of time?<br>When i set up a scene do i create any grey folks in there? What happens if i want to challenge grey folks?<br><br>I really want to emphasize what mike said about War Panopoly. That would really make play more exciting for me.<br><br>The fonts are really squished. THere is just A LOT on each page. Space things out a bit more, please, for readability. The photos from movies are evocative, but i thought they were a little distracting, they seem out of place.  Also, there are too few of them, either have more images or none at all. <br><br>I REALLY want to play this. In fact i think i'll run it as the larp i'm supposed to throw at camp nerdly. I'll propose that tommorow, after a night's rumination.

I will likely make use of at least one.<br><br>Yes, the game involves the supernatural.  But most as a sideline - it's one of the pressures on the game; the thing that I can use to 'crucible' the characters; it's not the main show.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L. Rhoer</cite>However there is one huge gapping flaw. Your resolution system does not address more than one challenger, and one defender. Five or ten people in a challenge and stake setting before hand is going to be incredibly burdensome.</blockquote>\nAt present, players have been simply avoiding this kind of situation - and that's tricky.  Because it means that it is blocking natural play (and not deliberately), but I have NO CLUE how to solve it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Martin O'Leary</cite>if you're going to put rules on the web, put rules on the web.

I'll try to get a web-friendly version of the next playbook together once I have the next playbook.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Martin O'Leary</cite>Rules: Questions! What's the difference between a Boon and a Panoply? Why is there a distinction? How do I know what Taints or Vices someone has? Do tokens accrue to players or to characters? How do "grey" characters work in challenges?<br><br>You seem to be hiding some of the rules and setting from the players. This seems somewhat condescending, although I understand it is standard practice. Even if the archetype escalation is unique for each player, it would help to have some examples, so that the player has some idea what they're in for. In fact, examples would be useful just about everywhere.<br><br>The stakes negotiation seems quite badly defined, and likely to bog down play, or at least introduce significant handling time. Have you considered a ritualised structure to this? Something like the Key Phrases from Polaris could work extremely well in a LARP context.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nPanoplies mess with cards, boons don't.  The reason they are distinct is that I wanted the stuff those cards offer, in general, but I didn't want characters that had nothing but 'cardy' stuff.  Does that strike you as a pointless move?<br><br>Tokens accrue to players.  Which hopefully answers the "grey" qustion, too - you can use your tokens, or not, as an extra.  I'm no sure what I think of that; it <i>wasn't </i>a strongly-thought-out design decision, just what happened.<br><br>"More Examples" is so plainly a good idea that I'm just going to say:  Yes, thanks, I'll do that.<br><br>A ritualised structure adds more learning time, while saving on handling time in play.  This makes me twitchy; I'd need a ritualised structure that could be learned and remembered quickly enough that players would find it worth that investment - key phrases are too easily confused and forgotten, in my experience, but I'm not closed to the idea.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65594/#Comment_65594" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T16:12:38+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  4:12PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>I will look at it over the weekend, Levi (amidst my own deadlines).

Why do we want to set scenes? What do they do? How do we know when they're done? How do we know when we want to allow everyone in a scene or restrict access? How do we know when we want to hang playable NPCs? What do we gain by setting a scene? Etc?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would we want to pre-announce a scene on the big board? What happens if the scene on the big board can't take place due to unanticipated game actions?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan only the gamemaster make hooks on the big board?<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the rule of lame needs a less confrontational name.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we know whether or not something is in a player's surround? Based on my previous experience running larps this ambiguity could cause player friction. Players get upset when they think something is under their domain and play that way, but have it retconned later.I think you really need to clarify how to determine whether something falls in someones surround.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules for resolving relationships are not well defined. Which player decides when it ends? What criteria do we judge off of? I think some examples would be useful here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you address resolving relationships before awarding relationships? This seems out of order.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "Did they escalate?" text box makes no sense to me at all. I can't make comments about what's wrong as I just don't understand. It also seems to be in the wrong section under vices, very counter intuitive placing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion 2 taints would be too many. Likely you only want to have your characters have one flaw. My experience suggests that they will only play one flaw well no matter how many are on paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the game has a lot of potential. I really like surround and the rule of lame. In my 75+ game these two rules, if they work, would have severely reduced my workload. I also like the token resolution if you can solve the multi-challenge problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67036/#Comment_67036" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-06T18:41:45+00:00" title="May  6, 2007  6:41PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *Stares at Clyde's post*<br><br>*Stares at calendar*<br><br>Dammit.<br><br>But thank you.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.
