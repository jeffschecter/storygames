I've only posted ... twice now, so I'm going to come right out and apologize if I may appear too bold (maybe i'm just like my father?)<br/><br/>Have I been to Zont? Yes.  Did I lose my journal there? No, that's just the title of a game I've been working on this year. It started out as a Game Chef entry, and I've been working on making it a real boy.<br/><br/><b>I really need some kind folk to play-test my beta version. </b><br/><br/>Here's what you're in for:<br/><br/><i><b>Who are you and what did you do on Zont?</b><br/><br/>You have just awoke aboard the Starship Majesty and you cannot remember your name, much less what you did on the planet the ship is orbiting. The ship's AI explains that an error occurred during teleportation protocols between the planet surface and the ship. The good news is that it has managed to isolate and save the memories from being lost, the bad news is that you and your teams memories are all mixed together. Knowing only pieces of the story, its up to you and the team to recreate the trip, remember who you are, and figure out if you accomplished what you were supposed to do before you get back to Earth.</i><br/><br/>It's a gm-less (although there is a Captain!) story/rpg game that uses a classic "Concentration/Memory" mechanic to help the players generate their memories. I've got a detailed PnP pdf for anyone who is feeling adventurous. <br/><br/>I intend, as many dreamers do nowadays, to offer this up to the Kickstarter gods, maybe next year depending on how this goes. And because of that I would like to give those groups who help play-test it and provide a decent review a free version of the finished product (if the KS is successful).<br/><br/>Email for the PDF if you're interested! <a href="mailto:kevin@zontco.com" rel="nofollow">kevin@zontco.com</a><br/><br/>I think i've taken enough of your time, cheers.<br/><br/>TL;DR <br/>Email me to join the hunt for my journal!   <a href="mailto:kevin@zontco.com" rel="nofollow">kevin@zontco.com</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
