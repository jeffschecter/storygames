He didn't cover the entire game, but most of it, and by the time the video was done I was ready to bust into the game and review the rest of the rules.<br/><br/>I wish more RPGs did this. Jason is doing it for some of his games, and there's the awesome video for Hell For Leather which shows the die column and all. But those are both done by the creators. I'd like to see more fans try to tackle basic RPG rules explanations over video/youtube for games that they like, even if its just the basics...<br/><br/>Huh. I guess this post is a "I would love to see someone else do this thing", with no real discussion beyond that. :-)  But if anyone has any comments (Hell Yeah! No And Fuck You!) I'd like to see them.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293782/#Comment_293782" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T11:15:22+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 11:15AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like videos like this.

I thought that was thought provoking, but I'm not sure there's any useful takeaway from it.<br/><br/>I think on a case by case basis you can sometimes take things away. For instance, I was doing a survey and the result turned out that I was 50% kinesthetic, 25% aural and 25% visual (not exactly, but that's roughly the split). I thought that it was interesting, but that I potentially had a bias towards not sitting down and paying attention and maybe I just answered the questions that produced that result. Then there was an example they had that kinesthetic learners do their best thinking while moving around, it wasn't exactly that, but still something to that effect. I happen to do my best thinking for essays at 3AM pacing back and forth. Not sure what the 3AM has to do with it, but the pacing back and forth certainly fits. There isn't a huge deal to take away from that though, as I can learn pretty well by reading books and listening to lectures, although in both cases it depends on good books and good lectures, so perhaps that's the key - something has to be taught well, and that's more important than how it's taught.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293905/#Comment_293905" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-18T18:46:56+00:00" title="September 18, 2010  6:46PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish more games used diagrams to explain the core cycles of play.

I thought that was thought provoking, but I'm not sure there's any useful takeaway from it.<br/><br/>So. Like. Yes. A lot of how people learn is social conditioning (see: girls and math/science) But at the same time, sometimes there's more than just "learning styles" that factor into the equation. I am moderately ADD and I can tell you that I am NOT CAPABLE of paying attention to lectures past about 45 minutes no matter how hard I try. (I wound up recording lectures so I could go back and listen to the parts I missed later.)<br/><br/>So, yeah, for me I definitely prefer minimal instruction and diving right in, just because I have trouble paying attention to long-winded explanations of rules. But I won't confuse that for being the same as needing to learn by doing, because if you lend me the rules text a week beforehand I do just fine with learning from the text.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>It's got a review tucked in there, but it explains all the basics of how the game works, as well as the cool points.

But yeah, as a teaching tool it would be a nice addition to the toolkit, in addition to being a good way of selling games to non-gamers who don't really understand what gaming is.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>I wish more games used diagrams to explain the core cycles of play.
