Feel free to add your own (for any game) or comment or question someone else's.<br/>\nI've just realised I've also made this thing too damn long.. Damn. Er... These things probably don't need to be this long.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Trollbabe</b><br/>\nI play with two or three players. Occasionally just one, but only once with four. Children or adults, but not mixed, depending on the personalities. I usually run straight sword and sorcery, never yet with actual trollbabes. I have run one game with a Doctor Who/Flash Gordon 'adventures in time and space' style though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my games have been one-shots, but I've had a couple of two-shots and a 6+ session campaign too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring play, I have the summarised GMing rules on to two sides of A4, and I've put all the in-play mechanics on to the player's character sheets, which I have a copy of.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Phase 1: The Map</b> (15-30 mins)<br/>\nI put a large sheet of ordinary brown wrapping paper on the table, along with some thick coloured marker pens (black, red, green and blue).<br/>\nI discuss with the players what kind of fantasy they want (narrow down from random stuff: Steampunk? Judeo-Christian demons and angels? Lovecraftian? Straight Conan? Elves?), and while we're doing this we draw the map on the brown paper, and I'll also scribble some notes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players usually end up just drawing on the corner closest to them and filling it with haunted bogs, volcanoes, skull-shaped wizardly towers, floating sky-castles, cottages in the wilderness, etc. So I usually try and tie things together with the boring stuff like defining the landmasses and connecting the mountain ranges and rivers. I discourage labeling much at this stage, but there's usually one or two items where a player says "And this is the city of Fangtrom, famous for its fighting pits" and that's all good.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I've decided the map has enough random scribble on it, I demand that the pens get dropped and then I take them away.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring play, the map can be supplemented by additional sheets which reveal details to the sides or zoom in as required, but that's mostly during a campaign. But even in one-shots, the map will change during play as features are named and labeled, new areas are 'discovered' and filled in, or in-game events effect the landscape (volcanoes erupt, towns are conquered, towers topple, things burn/turn undead/get swallowed by hell/etc). Of course, players who cause such things must alter the map themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Phase 2: Characters and Oracles</b> (30-45 mins)<br/>\nI'll hand out character sheets. We'll talk about where their character is from (it must be on the map), how they fight, do magic and talk (they must be able to do all three to some degree), what they look like, what they're carrying, etc. This talk will usually further define what kind of setting this is, particularly how magic works.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers rarely create characters who come from the same place as each other, or start the game in the same place. In my campaign, the characters never met, but their stories affected each other through political repercussions, and simple consequences (a town is indirectly destroyed thanks to one character's actions, the other character experiences it first hand in the next scene).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it's pertinent, I'll explain how to fill out a bit on the character sheet. Characters come together in quite a piecemeal fashion, with revisions and corrections, etc, but I like this organic process.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce everyone is happy, we'll move on to 'play proper'. This will occasionally leave some blanks that can be filled in when it comes in play. And especially, quite naturally players will add stuff that 'they were carrying all along', in addition to ordinary changes during play (new things picked up, scars and injuries, new relationships, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring this time, I'll ask them to pick an oracle from In A Wicked Age, and draw two or three cards from it (based on how many players are present, and how long the game should be) and I'll scribble those down. These are always just a guide for me: Firstly they tell me what kind of backdrop for their adventure each player wants based on the oracle they chose, and secondly it gives me some ready-made really cool elements to throw at them which support that. The foreshadowing of elements randomly turns up some gold too as players naturally tie things together and anticipate stuff (consciously or otherwise).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Phase 3: Individual stories</b> (1 hour or more)<br/>\nI'll ask a player where their character is on the map right now, and I'll ask them specifically what they are doing there (usually just wandering as a mercenary or treasure hunter, but some players like to start off already on a grand quest). Then I'll use what has already been established about the character and the area and frame a scene, adding stuff from the player's oracle elements or just plain invented as required. This scene must spur the character into some kind of action that will bring them into conflict with something, and will introduce some unexplained elements (cliche stuff is fine: unknown motives, strange only-told-in-legend creatures, vague ill omens). I'll have no idea myself about these explanations, but it's best to have lots of seeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring play, the only thing I write down are NPC names and traits (usually just acting advice like, 'lisps' or 'smug' or 'desperate'), and these unresolved seeds, so I have a grab bag of elements to reincorporate along with the oracle elements.<br/>\n<br/>\ncontinued...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oreso" title="oreso"><img alt="oreso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oreso">oreso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223320/#Comment_223320" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T16:00:03+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  4:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever it feels good, I'll cut to the next player and repeat the process. Cliffhangers are good of course, but also when a character has just been given a new problem, so the player has time to think about it before it's their go again. Also, quite obviously, I'll cut to another player when I've ran out of interesting ideas, I find my brain ticks over and works things out when I'm not paying attention, or else the actions of other characters will provide inspiration if not direct interference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis cutting from player to player is now the rhythm of play, and it might stay this way throughout the rest of the game. I don't always go around the table clockwise, but I ty to divide 'screen time' as equally as possible, while following connected action (when one character's actions have affected another).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll frame each scene by either telling the player where their character is if it's obvious, or asking them, or some conversation about it. Then I'll throw some elements in somehow. And I'm really not all that subtle. I'll never explicitly remind the players what the oracle elements were during play or anything, but it's quite common for players to run away and hide from something and then stumble into a cave with a djinn in it, or fall asleep and start to commune with a spirit, or an evil politician arrests them, or they receive a love letter from a princess. I don't railroad players towards elements, but they <i>will</i> jump down a character's throat occasionally. Wherever a character is, interesting stuff is always happening right now. And if it isn't already established in the fiction, then I'll throw something new in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs play continutes, obviously the balance shifts away from oracle and invented elements towards reincorporated ones, and this is good. Throwing lots of wholly new stuff in all the time loses meaning. Try and reincorporate, even if it's just the little details, and especially if it's from another player's story.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, what do players do when it isn't their turn? This is why I like two-three players, to minimise downtime. I mean, I nominate NPC roles (especially the relationships to another PC, since those characters are mechanically much more the related player's responsibility than mine, so giving them to someone else means I don't need to worry about them at all). And I encourage discussion and kibbitzing, but the downtime can and does become a problem if you don't cut often enough and the group is too large (and especially if they're adults, I actually find kids are more tolerant of mostly sitting and listening than my regular adult group. It's what they learn in school, I guess).<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had games where characters never actually meet and only indirectly interfere with each other, and in this case the game ends quite simply when their personal stories are resolved. More commonly however, characters meet up and a grand encompassing plot happens and play gradually phases into...<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Phase 4: Grand encompassing plot happens</b> (One hour or more, but not much more per session because it's just too exhausting for me)<br/>\nPlayers can introduce their character, even mid-conflict, into someone else's scene if it's reasonable. And I'm really flexible about this. In most of my games, there is severe time jumps between the different strands, and things only become fixed during play. For example, one character hadn't interacted with the others, but had an epic story where he tried to redeem his demonic nature, but got captured by some holy knights who mistook him as the destroyer of the village he was trying to protect, and we ended on a cliffhanger with his fate uncertain. In the very next scene, the other characters finally found whatever world-saving McGuffin they were looking for, and blew this mystical horn, releasing a demon who had been sealed there by some holy knights 500 years ago, who was of course the first character. Beautiful moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was only because of the dice that I was given full reign to mess with the character like that, but even so, there's usually some time lag. Like, a character jumps hundreds of miles because she really needs to be in this scene RIGHT NOW, thus we'll make her adventure until now some weeks into the past to give her the travel time to arrive RIGHT NOW. I try to keep the timeline always moving forwards though (we wouldn't jump back and play the missing weeks, and maybe only quickly filling in the blanks with free narration if required). Oh, and the baddies can do the same, of course, and occasionally I'll zoom the action out and skip ahead. So, if a character joins an army in one scene, will skip ahead to the middle of a campaign in the next scene, perhaps rolling a conflict for the entire action of the campaign up until that point (each block of narration would be a whole battle).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah. Characters almost always compete to some degree, and cooperate to some degree, and I try to gently balance this to always be uncertain (if they're fighting each other then give them some cause to unite, if they're united then give them cause to betray each other). No need to be too pushy, but it adds some tension.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout half the time, a player character will blatantly be realised as the Big Bad for the others to fight (nothing to do with morality of course, usually all the characters are either motivated by revenge, power, glory, etc, OR they're a fanatic, religious or otherwise, on some stupid quest. Sword and sorcery seems to come naturally to people).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, other stuff happens too, like, in my campaign, one became an agent of a not-clearly-evil emperor, the other became an agent for a not-clearly-good rebellion. Let the lines be drawn by the players where they may, but sooner or later it will come to an epic smackdown. And then after that we freely discuss and narrate epilogues and make the final updates to the map and end the session. Reflecting on the map and the changed character sheets and trying to summarise the story is pretty fun, cos a lot of plot happens very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've yet to have it where all the player characters have banded together and I've had to provide purely NPC opposition, but I guess it could happen. If you can't make a character fall to the Dark Side, despite revealing that he's the PC's father and offering cookies, then I dunno. Guess you'll have to run with it, and just try to make it as personal and yet as epic as possible (whereas before, all the players know each other's stories up to the final battle, so everyone knows how it resonates with everyone else).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
