All of them were doing interesting stuff. There were the Jeepformers, the people running a school with LARP as a teaching method, the TV people using LARP for a children's program, the Hamlet-inspired Fastaval scenario writer, etc etc. <br/><br/>And it struck me that I'm fortunate enough to understand both those people and the people here (and at the Forge) - but there are a lot of brilliant people here, on these fora, who would probably love to know more of what's going on outside of the English-speaking world.

The Knudepunkt books, Turku Manifesto and couple other papers contain pretty much everything available from Finnish scene in English. Even counting most of the relevant academic work. Most of the information around here gets passed on in panels, workshops, Finnish magazines and more or less drunken oral tradition - or through playing. I suspect things have been pretty much similar in other Nordic countries as well. I pass greedy glances towards the Norweigan Archieve -article in Knudepunkt book.<br/><br/>With all the manifestoes, academic research and stuff, I haven't really seen RPG blogging in English from around here apart from my own blog. And I'm not really explaining the local things, just reacting to foreign influences.

I often pay sharp attention to the Nordic schools and their many good works. But there are also many ways in which what they are doing is a different discipline, and so I don't talk about it a lot around here, or follow it as deeply as our particular sub-community's conversations, because it isn't what I'm doing. <br/><br/>Now, maybe I should. Maybe I should try some Jeepform. It'd probably be awesome and teach me a lot. I know there is more out there in the Nordic countries and with those crazy Finns that I'm missing because I don't pay as close attention to it... but the truth is that when a lot of the best work is being done on something that isn't my personal focus I often just don't have time or energy to be into it in the same way. <br/><br/>Also, I think there probably is more silent crossover than we know about. I have been a reader of Polyfem and Interacting Arts for sometime. Mo reads more of them than I do. Neither of us comments much, however, for reasons like those listed above. Similarly Mo recently found out that lots of Nordic type folks read Sin Aesthetics, despite the fact that few (any?) leave comments.

Don't we? Ben paid so much attention, he toured Finland (Eero offered to have other folks tour, too, but we've just not had the time to go to Finland for several weeks at least). The nordic scene was nominated for the Diana Jones awared once. I've been talking to Jukka, and Thomas, and Eero, (and, you, Matthijs) and about a dozen other folks from Scandawhovia for so long now, I feel like I know their scene pretty well. And, even when I find that it's not my thing, I certainly respect the work done there. I don't know how many times I've cited the Turku Manifesto, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm hardly the only one. There have been dozens of folks who've participated in discussions on these subjects in the past. I'd posit that, in fact, given that we don't play in the "Nordic Scene" that we give it tons of love from over here in North America.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, there's probably a disproportionate attention paid by other countries on what goes on in the US. But that's to do with us inventing the form, having played it for longer than anyone else, and having a larger number of players than anywhere else (in sheer numbers, not per capita). That is, there's just more going on here than there is in Finland, so more to talk about. Heck, I'd guess that there's more RPG stuff going on in the US than the rest of the world combined. Japan and England notwithstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's amazing is that their relatively small scene is so vibrant , innovative and alive that it's worth talking about when we've got so much going on here already.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my perspective. That's not to say that there isn't more to learn from other foreign scenes. But even somebody as obsessive as I am has trouble keeping track of the gaming going on here, much less the rest of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext I'll have to try to understand the whole Japanese scene... that's going to take some time...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58485/#Comment_58485" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T09:01:39+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  9:01AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh hell yea.

The two "communities" of LARPers and tabletop roleplayers overlap in that vocal section of players (though not as much when counting the whole lot of players), whereas in US, I presume, the overlap is much smaller and the most vocal RPG enthusiasts come from more tabletop-oriented background. So whereas we (as in Me, and probably some others) see LARPs and tabletop playing as similar activities done in slightly different medium, people from elsewhere see LARPs and tabletop playing as different activities all-together. I'd think it's hard for us to talk about roleplaying without talking about both LARPs and tabletop at the same time, where as for other folks it's hard to talk about about the together.<br><br>I talked briefly with Ben when he was back here and quite frankly, I felt that we were talking about different things, him trying to map what I was talking about to his experiences and vice versa (what's that "game"-thing, anyway?). I'm not sure if that was mutual, but I'd guess that the unwanted reaction is certainly based on something - like getting The Nordic Immersionist Guy coming to camp nerdly and telling you that guys, you're missing the point of immersive playing and telling you about how LARPs work.<br><br>On the other hand, there's too much discussion on That Nordic Thing as a set of techniques and whatever and too little discussion on how the playing style(s) evolved to what they are and what kind of role the rather tight-knitted playing communities on the LARP side have been playing on that. It's like talking about the tip of the iceberg without covering the stuff that's it's build upon, that now rests beneath the surface. Or that's my take, at least.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58523/#Comment_58523" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T11:59:26+00:00" title="March  1, 2007 11:59AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think that over-focus on techniques is a huge problem.<br><br>I didn't feel totally at sea with the Nordic LARP groups -- frankly, a lot of what they were saying was quite similar to my college gaming group, which was heavily LARP and immersion focused.<br><br>I felt more at home with some of the Finnish theorists who weren't just interested in "immersion is the whole of the experience, there is nothing else."

And there can be little doubt that most people will talk more to, and about, people they know; I'm much more likely to pimp a friend's good game than an unknown person's good game, for example. This is probably one (of many) factors that keep different groups/gaming cultures from interacting - the people we know show up on our radars as big red dots; other people are little pink smudges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
