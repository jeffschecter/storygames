This was part of my childhood experience too.  The older kid who let me play in his games at the public library one summer referred to To-Hit rolls as "Saves vs. Stupid"...the idea being...if we were playing smarter we wouldn't have gotten into that fight to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of folks (notably Luke Crane and Thor Olavsrud) chimed in that I was mistaken in my assertion that the majority of rules in D&amp;D; (specifically mentioning Moldvay Basic) were about Combat at all.  Since they are currently playing a campaign using those rules and I haven't cracked the box open in over 20 years...I figured I'd better check my aging memory by doing a count.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the count took the better part of 4 hours...and I figure it might be interesting for folks in the community to know exactly what percentage of the rules in Basic D&amp;D; were dedicated to Combat...I thought I'd immortalize my findings for future reference over here on SG, where they're more likely to be searchable then buried in my G+ stream.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo without further ado...here are my findings.\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm using the Moldvay 1981 edition, 64 pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't want to simply measure volume of text. I wanted to measure actual rules. And here I mean things that are explicit "You do this thing now" or "roll this" or "add this modifier" or "spend this resource", you get the idea. I explicitly didn't want guidelines and advice. I was thus rather pleasantly surprised that much of the "guidelines and advice" is presented as an actual rule. Mappers and Callers...not just a wishy washy thing but a "thou shalt do this now" thing...the ultimate "change whatever you want" advice not withstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I determined to count 4 distinct things:<br/>\n1) "No rules": I used this category for the advice or descriptive stuff that didn't include specific "do this" type of instruction. Also art and credits and acknowledgements and the like.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) "Character Creation Rules": I used this category for things that were about building or improving your character and which DIDN'T fall into one of the other categories.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) "Non Combat Rules": I defined non combat rules as rules pertaining to DOING STUFF outside of combat. For instance, a rule that converts treasure into XPs is not doing stuff...that went into Character Creation. A rule that says how many languages your character speaks...that's doing stuff (communication to monsters/NPCs) that isn't combat...so Languages went into Non Combat (along with things like movement outside of encounters, encumbrance, torch burning durations, hiring retainers, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) "Combat Rules": I defined combat rules as any rule that directly pertains to initiative, to-hits, damage, saves, the use of weapons and armor, movement inside encounters and the like. Stuff that I felt was clearly useful both inside and outside of combat (such as light sources, healing, and many of the miscellaneous spell effects) I counted as 1/2 Non Combat and 1/2 Combat. On a few occasions I went 1/3 2/3 or 2/3 1/3.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it proved difficult to simply count rules. If you have a table with 20 numbers on it...is that 20 rules? If you have a paragraph with only 1 rule in it, is that just 1 rule? Does that make the table 20x more important than the paragraph?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I did a rather complex hybrid and made my calculations as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I divided each page into sections. Where sections headers were provided, I used those. Otherwise I simply divided each page into 1/2s 1/4s or 1/8ths.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I then counted the number of rules in each section, and assigned each rule to one of the 3 categories using the logic above. If there were no rules in that section I assigned it to the "no rule" category.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I then created a ratio for each section which served to normalize the volume of rules. For instance if the table with 20 numbers took up 1/8 of a page and 1/2 those numbers were combat related and 1/2 were non combat related then I assigned that 1/8th of a page 50% to combat rules and 50% to non combat rules. If the paragraph that had only 1 rule took up a 1/4 of the page and that rule was a non combat rule, then I assigned that 1/4 page to non combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) I then rolled up each section to create a page by page ratio between the 4 categories.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Finally I rolled it all up and established what % of the book was dedicated to each of the 4.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give you some examples of how I applied the logic I used:<br/>\n1) Page 7 has 7 tables on it. 1 for each of the attributes and one for experience bonuses for prime attributes. The experience bonuses I judged to be a character creation rule and so assigned 1/7 of that page to character creation. The Strength Table has modifiers to-hit, to damage, and for opening doors. I judged to-hit and damage to be combat related and opening doors to be non combat related so I assigned 2/3 of that 1/7 (9.5% of the page) to combat and the other 1/3 (4.8% of the page) to non combat. Similarly Intelligence got fully assigned to Non Combat (languages) and Dexterity to Combat (Missile to-hit, AC modifier, and initiative). Constitution determined hit points and I judged Hitpoints to be 50% related to Combat (taking damage from monsters) and 50% related to Non Combat (taking damage from other stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I went through spells and assigned each spell according to some straight forward logic. If it was clearly a damaging spell like Magic Missile or Fireball it went into Combat. If I couldn't think of a common Combat use for it (like Detect Evil or Knock) it went in Non Combat. If I could see how it would be useful both ways (like Levitate or Web) it went 50/50. Some spells like Light I did an extra judgement. Light is clearly useful both in and out of combat, but since my goal was to count rules and the spell makes an extra effort to describe using it to blind monsters by casting it in their eyes and the only listed effect of being blinded is being unable to attack, I judged that 2/3 Combat, 1/3 Non Combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Monsters initially gave me pause. I knew that simply treating all monsters (which is alot of pages in the book) as Combat Rules would be misleading, as the threat of monsters, avoiding monsters, detecting monsters, and parlaying with monsters are all Non Combat activities. But what ratio to assign? Being less interested in what ratio the typical DM uses the monsters and more interested in the volume of rules related to combat vs. non combat activity, I decided to go with the Stat Block. Stats like AC, Hit Dice, Attacks, and Damage are clearly Combat focused. Movement is given in both in combat and out of combat speeds so that is clearly 50/50. Likewise "No. Appearing" has legitimate uses both in and out of combat so I treated that as 50/50. Saving Throws and Morale was a little harder. They are clearly MOSTLY Combat related, but I could think of times where they'd be useful outside of combat. But then similarly Treasure Type and Alignment are clearly MOSTLY Non Combat related, but I could think of times where they'd be useful inside of combat (such as the example of letting the Bugbear use the magic sword found in his treasure. So I just kept each of them simple and figured it would average out. That led me to assign 7/10 of all pages dedicated to monsters to Combat Rules and 3/10 to Non Combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I went and did the calculations:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo Rules: Roughly 17 pages of the book contain no rules at all (26.7%)<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter Rules: Roughly 4 pages of the book contain rules that specifically have no use other than defining or improving character stats (6.4%)<br/>\n<br/>\nNon Combat Rules: Roughly 17 pages of the book are dedicated to describing Non Combat related activity (27.7%)<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat Rules: Roughly 26 pages of the book are dedicated to describing Combat related activity (39.2%)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's not a majority, but it is a sizable plurality. Since plurality is easily mistaken for majority, I'll forgive myself...since I think the point stands even so.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT...if we DON'T count the 17 pages of non-rules and just compare what proportion each category occupies not of the entire book (64 pages), but just of the portion that contains rules (47 pages) then we find that Combat IS, in fact, a majority: 54.4% vs. 8.7% for Characters, and 36.9% for Non Combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo by that measure...my assertion that the majority of RULES in D&amp;D; deal with combat is correct. Which again leads me to muse how much effort in play is dedicated to purposefully avoiding engaging over 1/2 the rules in the book.\ufeff                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375759/#Comment_375759" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T20:16:52+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  8:16PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting work, thanks for this.

I wasn't checking the rules proportion instead I was looking for any notion that "a whole lot of Old School play involves desperately doing whatever it takes to avoid getting into combats" is actually supported by the game.  What I found was that the sample transcript of play involves 3 straight up combats.  It begins right after a combat, there's a combat right in the middle the details of which are not spelled out and it ends right at the top of a combat.  Also as far as I can tell, the only reason the party avoids the implied encounter with Bandits is because they're down a party member who was killed by a trap.  Also note how casually being killed by the trap is treated.  <br><br>I'm pretty convinced that "a whole lot of Old School play involves desperately doing whatever it takes to avoid getting into combats" is a cultural artifact, not an actual design feature.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375770/#Comment_375770" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T20:35:11+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  8:35PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.  That's my point.  A sizeable number of people dedicated to old school play have as part of their cultural experience the desire to avoid engaging in over half of the rules found in their game design of choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this method of play largely derived from the extraordinary fragility of low level characters.  Combine this with the large relative weight of experience coming from treasure vs. experience coming from killing monsters and I think its pretty clear that you are more likely to level up if you focus on coming up with clever ways to get the treasure without risking your life in a fight.  Combine that with the largely uninteresting and tactically underdeveloped combat rules vs. the potential for deeply interesting free form creative puzzle solving and I think you'll find that coming up with clever ways to get the treasure is also simply more fun than engaging the rather boring fight mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if this wasn't an intentional design feature...it probably should have been...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375774/#Comment_375774" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T20:54:22+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  8:54PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look at the character sheet though.

Rules for parlaying with monsters and making reaction rolls means not all encounters have to end in hostility.  Other spells like Charm Person help even more with this.  Spells like Ventriloquism are ideal for making distracting noises to make the monsters go some other direction and clever uses of Phantasmal Force can get pursuers all turned around.  Invisibility and Sleep are of course obvious, but even Levitate is a great way to avoid ground bound opponents if the ceiling is high enough.  Hold Portal spells are great for denying routes to your enemies, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond spells there are specific rules for doors and specific mention of using the ubiquitous hammer and spikes for holding them closed.  There are also rules for listening at doors, which is key to not stumbling into something unaware.  There are explicit instructions for how fast monsters move and how far away from the party they are first detected.  The expectation is that once brought into play, the DM is constrained to move them square by square, not simply dramatically teleport them via narration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules for running the order of events during a 10 minute game turn are positively board game-esque:<br/>\n1) Roll for wandering monsters<br/>\n2) Party moves, enters room, listens, searches<br/>\n3) If monsters are not encountered, proceed to next turn.  Otherwise roll for how many and continue<br/>\n4) Roll for distance detected<br/>\n5) Roll for surprise for both sides (giving the party an opportunity to escape when they have surprise) and initiative<br/>\n6) Roll for Monster Reaction (which is only automatically hostile on 5 or less on 2d6, and decidedly not hostile on 9 or more)<br/>\n7) This step includes specific steps for:  talking, running away, evasion and pursuit, and only THEN proceeding to Combat<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Combat Rules contain rules for both retreats and fighting withdrawals, as well as rolling for monster morale...which if used as written will result in quite a few encounters where the monsters (or at least some of them) actually flee if the party manages to score some early success.  This section also includes verbiage around monsters surrendering.  There are rules for moving at running speed (vs. mapping speed) as well as evasion and pursuit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wandering Monster Rules are simplistic but something of the game's Killer App.  The DM rolls every 2 turns with a 1 in 6 chance of a monster appearing within 20-120' of the party with higher probabilities or more frequent checks for certain areas or parties that are making a lot of noise.  When you correlate these rules to the rules for moving, durations for light sources remaining lit, amount of time to search rooms, etc you can see that in Basic D&amp;D; (even more than I remember it being in 1E AD&amp;D;) the 10 minute turn reigns supreme and regulates everything.  It becomes clear that the primary party activity is to balance moving through the dungeon slowly and carefully enough to map thoroughly (to avoid getting lost), avoid traps and ambushes, and find the hidden doors and treasures while simultaneously moving quickly enough to not run out of torches or risk encountering more wandering monsters than necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the rules for stocking dungeons only propose a 2 in 6 chance of any given room actually containing a monster...which is equal to the 2 in 6 chance to be empty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall...I'd say its the "free form outside of combat" bit that's unsupported by the rules.  How to adjudicate whether any given strategy or party action is successful or not may not be explicitly covered (though there's lots of d6 rolls to draw on for inspiration) but the primary structure will be proceeding to move through the map at a rate of 6 squares every 10 minutes (with the ability to see only 3 squares beyond that, making wandering monster rolls every 20 minutes, and replacing torches every 60 minutes.  One then immediately sees the utility in sending an unencumbered invisible elf with the ability to move 12 squares and see 6 squares beyond that to scout around in advance of the party...and from there all sorts of "small unit tactics" type activity can be experimented with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375836/#Comment_375836" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T06:48:48+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  6:48AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>One then immediately sees the utility in sending an unencumbered invisible elf with the ability to move 12 squares and see 6 squares beyond that to scout around in advance of the party...and from there all sorts of "small unit tactics" type activity can be experimented with.</blockquote>\nThis was exactly the same conclusion I came to after re-reading that old Moldvay Basic book as well.<br><br>Part of the trick in that for me is that I actually came to play minis wargames <b>after</b> having played BD&amp;D with a more loosie-goosie approach that was already common when I started around 1981 or so, and I only really realized the implications of those actual rules when I re-tried playing the game some time around 2005 or 2006.<br><br>It also implies some higher level resource management and decision making.

Generally, fighting is pretty straight forward. Hit the thing enough times to subdue or kill it, then move on. I think of how infrequently a novel describes a fight in great detail. It's boring to read. Maybe the fight lasts a page or so, but much of that text is dedicated to interior monologue or descriptions of onlookers.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
