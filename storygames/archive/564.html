<p>It's that time of year again. Income taxes! (If you're an American. I don't know what all you dirty hippie commie socialists do. Probably beg the government to take even more of your money.) (And I still don't know why some of you east coast bastards get an extra day this year.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I've often observed that the character sheets for some games bear a disturbing similarity to tax forms. Fill in blank here, here, here, and here. Sum to get subtotal here. Consult table here. Final number here. This is fun?!</p>
<p>The challenge of this thread is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe which game you've played had the most shocking amount of paperwork and bookkeeping required to play, OR...</li>
<li>Come up with a new game idea that actually uses IRS Form 1040 as a character sheet.</li>

                            An economically oriented GURPS Traveller game probably wins hands down - i even had a session in which we used the rules to build a whole new ship design, and figure out how to pay for it.<br/>

I think it might tell you something that the most prominent, most active character in that game was a lawyer...                        </div>

                            Well I've really thought about this and I was going to say:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Call of Chthulhu with the skills.  That's alot of scribbling.  But I've seen worse.<br/>
2.  Millenium's End.  Just figuring out where the hell you hit the person you were shooting at (let alone if you even shot him) could take some time.  But I've seen worse.<br/>
3.  Harn.  Try and keep track of wounds and armor.  I dare you.<br/>
4.  Hackmaster.  But we all know it's going to be a nightmare.  That's half the fun of it.  It's so mindboggling chartfilled I have yet to find anyone that wants to play it with me. <br/>
5.  But when it comes right down to it I'm going to have to say D&amp;D.  (Any of the incarnations of it.)  Have you seen the new way to calculate how many critters a Cleric can turn?!  Holy crap it's three different charts to reference.  <br/>

                            1) Probably about any Supers game I've ever played.  Nothing like wanting to track down and punch bad guys, but firnding out first how many yards/sec I can run, how many ounces I can lift, and exactly how many BTUs my Lazzer Vizzion can generate. DC Heroes used to be my favorite back in the day, and even today I don't have time for that shit.

                            Definately the most bookkeeping in one of my games was the GURPS Supers game  where the PCs were all supervillains just starting off, committing crimes to raise money, hiring goons and henchmen, and trying to take over the world. At the very least there was a lot of actual bookkeeping, tracking income and payrolls and whatnot.                        </div>

                            Rolemaster and Spacemaster.<br/>
<br/>
Very complicated process in creating characters, especially high-level characters.<br/>
<br/>
Roll ten stats. Only five of them give you development points. Use those development points to buy skills.<br/>
<br/>
Ranks 1-20 offer +5, those over that +2.<br/>
<br/>
Add your Stat bonus. Add your Equipment bonus. Add your racial mods. Add your cybernetic mods or magic or whatever. Total them up.<br/>
<br/>
It ended up being a lot of bean counting. Experience points were even worse, with experience points for six dozen things (in Rolemaster, including the destruction of gems??!?!) and then apply a whole series of modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
For combat, split your bonus, adding part of it to your attack roll and part to your defense roll, roll an open-ended d100, add your all your bonuses, subtract their defensive bonuses and consult a chart. Make a note of all the damage you do and criticals, because you'll get experience points for that.<br/>
<br/>
If using SpaceMaster, there's a very complex system for building a ship as well.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I'm exactly complaining: when I didn't have a game going on, I'd spend hours making up characters and get totally lost in the numbers. Now, though, when I think back to the folder stuffed full of these "characters", I get a bit of a chilll down my spine.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think this was nearly as bad as the Leading Edge Phoenix Command stuff, but it was still pretty bad, and I find it easier to understand a 1040A then I did the Rolemaster/Spacemaster system.                        </div>

<blockquote><b><br/>Come up with a new game idea that actually uses IRS Form 1040 as a character sheet.<br/></b></blockquote>
Is that all? With all the forms I filled out today, just using a 1040 should be easy.  Not to mention looking through piles of receipts to see which ones I could claim.  And the time spent on the phone with the IRS.... URGH<br/><br/>Just glancing over the 1040, I'd say the game will have to have components that deal with:
<ul>
<li>Marriage.</li>
<li>Kids.</li>
<li>All characters need to be divorced and paying alimony.</li>
<li>Self Employment</li>
<li>Poverty</li>
</ul>
A sample character would be a married head of the household self-employed farmer who owes his ex-wife serious amount of alimony, so much so that he is living in poverty and gets to use the EIC chart for task resolution.  His three kids give him bonus deductions so that he rolls lower on the EIC to win.                        </div>

<p>I'm thinking GM paperwork doesn't count, since GMs are gluttons for that sort of punishment anyway. (!)</p>
<p>Scratch, you forgot to mention you roll stats twice, the latter being for "potential." I also remember Rolemaster made you allocate your skill development a level <em>before</em> you actually earned the gains. Like a 401(k) or something.</p>
<p>I played in a D&amp;D game once where players were expected to keep double-entry ledgers of every single change in a character's net worth. Nice accounting paper was provided. Whoo, I feel heroic today! Where's my <em>ring of amortization</em>?</p>
<p>Keeping track of fatigue levels in <em>Ars Magica</em> was always a chore, and unlike other stuff it could wait for down time.</p>
<p>And they need to put a sticker on GURPS stuff that says, "You probably want a calculator -- one of those big programmable ones -- to use half this stuff."</p>
<p>Oh well. At least the IRS doesn't try to sell you the character sheets for $15.</p>
<p>Bryan,</p>
<p>A noble effort. So what's winning? Paying less taxes? Paying no taxes? Making his ex pay more taxes?</p>

                            The worst game like this I had played was some homebrews game. The character sheet was at least seven pages. The real problem with it was that much of the information was redundant so if you upped your dagger skill, you had to erase and rewrite in at least four different places. It was just dumb. Hence why I try to make my designs character sheet-less.                        </div>

                            I just finished a game with a nightmare amount of paperwork.  Players had to keep track of their characters finances (when each was as wealthy as your average multimillionaire), all the staff they employed, the amount of time devoted to various activities in an average week (in a game with multiple worlds with different time rates), numbers and types of troops, property portfolios, time devoted to relationships with important NPCs, a diary of their activities (both future and past), calendars, and so on.  One player even had a list of all her PCs staff, including birthdays and the location of their quarters within her house.  Oh, and of course, she had detailed plans of the layout of her PC's house.  I did less, but still ended up with 20+ spreadsheets.<br/>
<br/>
I found it stupid and tedious.  Another player really enjoyed it and did it for the fun.  But if other people didn't do the same work, she'd get all 'oh you can't prove your character has enough money to pay for that influence buying act, if you do it it will break the game for me and ruin my fun!' while refusing to refrain from doing that sort of influence buying thing herself.  So everyone ended up tracking all this crazy stuff because you never knew when she was going to demand proof that it was plausible for a character to do something.  Then the game died, which was probably a good thing in hindsight.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and this was an Amber DRPG game, where technically all the information on a character sheet should be able to fit on a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, I'm currently keen on games with low paperwork demands in practice as well as in theory.<br/>

                            I always wanted to run a Traveller game where the PC's owned a tramp freighter, travelling from star to star trying to make enough money to meet payroll and keep the ship fuelled.<br/>
<br/>
When "Far Trader" came out for GURPS Traveller, I thought the tools were finally there.  I put out the announcement and three players showed up.<br/>
<br/>
I created spreadsheets to get the number-crunching out of the way when it came to generating cargoes for them to pick from, liberally salted with fat-paying cargoes that had adventure hooks attached.  I thought I was home free.<br/>
<br/>
Woof.  What a nightmare.  The players loved the spreadsheets, and would pore over them for an hour or so at a time, sitting with calculators and their own tabulations, figuring risk into their calculations, and saving up the cash for the annual overhaul.  When a player brought in his laptop and showed me how he had entered the ship's finances into Quicken, I quit.  I handed my materials over to one of the other players, and told him to have at it... this wasn't what I had had in mind.<br/>
<br/>
They were quite disappointed that I left.                        </div>

<i>And I still don't know why some of you east coast bastards get an extra day this year.)</i><br/><br/>Because the IRS processing center for Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont and the District of Columbia is in Massachusetts, and Monday the 17th is a state holiday in Massachusetts (probably also in Maine, and maybe in New Hampshire). It's Patriot's Day, in celebration of April 19, 1775. In these days of Monday holiday's, it's the Monday of the week containing April 19, which coincidentally often is the day taxes are due. Since it's also a big break week for Massachusetts schools, presumably the feds decided to let the people in that center have the day off (not all feds in MA have the day off, my dad never did, and the Post Office is open). I suppose it could also be because Massachusetts residents got all uppity (and we know they have a history of getting uppity, after all, that's what the holiday's all about...), about having a different tax deadline for state and federal taxes (hm, what do those other states do for their state tax deadline? Do they just follow the federal deadline?).<br/><br/>Hmm, for IRS formy like character sheets... The sheets I used at one time for Cold Iron were pretty bad, heck, my current sheet is still pretty bad. I have come to appreciate sheets that basically make space for players to "show their work" for any computed stats, because players all too often make mistakes.<br/><br/>Adam - Powers and Perils - yea... That's probably one of the most mathy games. In Avalon Hill's tradition of really niggly rules.<br/><br/>For a modern indie game, Burning Wheel has a pretty shocking character sheet...<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            Making a rigger/samurai for Shadowrun.  Custom picking the cyberware &amp; bioware to coordinate to keep your Essence above 0 and your BDI below, while keeping track of the costs to the nearest nuyen.  Then you tack on equiping yourself, designing and equiping multiple vehicles... even with a program to help out, it was a major pain.  And you're encouraged to spend every cent, since your money's cut by 90% at the end of character design... ugh.                        </div>

                            So, Internal, I've got some questions about your game.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still trying to figure out what the premise is.  I mean, the character sheet, even the "EZ" version, ultimately focuses around this "Tax Owed" stat (which I'm still having to get over the paradigm clash of not being BW style tax...)  But as far as I can tell, "Tax Owed" doesn't have any purpose in the game.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, a lot of the stats that lead up to that are evocative.  I really like "number of dependants" with the sort of subversive suggestion that dependants really are little sub-characters, since they don't fill in their own sheet, AFIACT.  While related characters have been used frequently, actually treating the character's family, household and spouse so directly really pushes for PCs that are married with children, which is fairly unusual in RPGs in general (Pendragon excepted).    And, assuming that less Tax Owed is better, I love the fact that you encourage more dependants and a spouse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But you don't spend any time on actually fleshing out these "dependants"  Instead I just multiply by 3200 and subtract from my Income.  Speaking of: AFAICT, Income and Taxes Paid both come from these "Form W-2" things, but I can't find any anywhere in the game materials.  Did I miss something?  Is there a suppliment out there I have to wait for before I can make a character?  Dude, HoL already did that, and it was funnier.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, there are a bunch of little auxilliary stats that I can't figure out what they're good for.  Biggest example: this little checkbox about "Contribute a dollar to the presidential election fund."  Huh?  It doesn't change anything on the sheet, and I can't see how it effects gameplay either.  Why would I check or not check that box?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the biggest issue - dude, the tax lookup table?  It goes on for pages!  Maybe when you started putting in dividing headers at each thousand dollars of income, you might have asked yourself "is this table too complex?"  I mean, I guess you really only use it for chargen, but still, since so many of my decisions in making my character revolve around the relationship between my marital status, Taxable Income and Tax Owed, it might be nicer if this was a simple formula or something.  It looks pretty linear.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I think there are some neat ideas in this game, but I really think you need to decide what your premise is and address it directly, rather in this weird tangential "Tax" thing.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>

<p>Judson,</p>
<p>You are just one of those indie hippie pinko narrativist bigots who is jealous because more people play "US Individual Income Tax Return" than the games you think are fun! My GM Herbie has been running a great campaign of "Income Tax" for years, and when I play I can totally imagine I'm actually there, paying taxes! Some people think the GM should fudge the numbers so that players don't ever actually have to pay taxes, but we let the capital gain distributions fall as they may! Some people knock the publisher as "The I.R.<strong>$.</strong>" but they have got lots of great stuff for their game!The upcoming Audit sourcebook provides the long-awated LARP rules!</p>
<p>Some people think "Income Tax" is just for nerds who hang out in their parents' home office, but lots of famous people have played! Celebrities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Willie Nelson</li>
<li>Martha Stewart</li>
<li>Darryl Strawberry</li>
<li>Richard Pryor</li>
<li>Spiro T. Agnew</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>I have this sick idea for a game where you get these cards with bios of various fictitious individuals, and you have to read through and pick out the relevant tax info (red herrings will be included). I'm not actually sure how to go from "accounting study tool" to "game you might actually consider playing," though.</p>
<p>My primary fixation, though, is that form design between tax forms and some character sheets is eerily similar.</p>

                            The usual-suspect games have been mentioned, but along with them, let me toss in Nephilim, which I think actually beats out Ars Magica for its attention to occultist detail of the most schizophrenic, patten-obsessed sort. When I realized that you had to calculate new magic modifiers depending on the <i>day</i> the spell is cast, I gave up.<br/>
<br/>
Also, good call on the deceptively-scary possibilities of games like Amber, which are apparently not going to be a big record-keeping deal, but also lend themselves to Gamist applications through husbanding resources.                        </div>
