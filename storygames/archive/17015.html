I have a system for creating Life Paths for my eternally-in-progress game Mage Blade. Problem is, the idea of creating all of those Life Paths is really daunting, so I can never get started. So I'm going to try crowdsourcing it. I will provide my system here in this thread (see next post) for anyone who wants to help me out and earn some hours in the process.<br/><br/>My goals with this are:<br/>- To get some Life Paths made (duh)<br/>- To help motivate myself to make some<br/>- To put the creation system through its paces<br/>- To get an idea for what sorts of Life Paths people would expect/desire<br/>- To help get the currency flowing in our Villages circle.<br/><br/>There are two ways to do this. First, you can reply right here in this thread. If you followed the link here FROM villages, and don't care to sign up with Story Games, you can e-mail me at lifepaths (at) wolvesdenpublishing (dot) com. For each Life Path you submit, I will pay one hour. If you ask questions or make observations or suggestions on the system, I will pay more, based on your feedback.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386722/#Comment_386722" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T08:04:12+00:00" title="August  9, 2012  8:04AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2012 8:05AM by Wolfe.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, there are two different types of lifepaths: Origins and basic lifepaths. Origins generally cover birth to age 5, and as such, you can only have one per character. Basic lifepaths cover everything else. We're going to talk about basic lifepaths first, then discuss Origins in terms of how they differ from basic.<br/><br/><b>Basic Lifepaths:</b> Creating a lifepath is essentially a matter of filling in a bunch of blanks. With that in mind, much of what I'm going to talk about is simply going to be choose this, distribute that. More than that will generally involve discussing concerns and reasons for making specific decisions. To start off, I'm going to list the steps in order, then we'll get into more detail, as necessary.<br/><br/>1. Select a name for the lifepath<br/>2. Write a short description<br/>3. Determine prereqs, if any<br/>4. Choose Skills, and distribute roll ranges.<br/>5. Select Focus Skills<br/>6. Distribute skill points/year between path and generic skill points<br/>7. Distribute attribute Bias<br/>8. Determine minimum and maximum duration<br/>9. Choose or create a Set, if applicable<br/><br/>1. Select a name for the lifepath: This is as simple as it sounds. The name should be short and descriptive, giving a strong idea of what the lifepath entails.<br/><br/>2. Write a short description: This will sometimes feel unnecessary, as sometimes the name will explain it all. In those cases, a quotation or a such to give a feel for the path is appropriate.<br/><br/>3. Determine prerequisites: Not all lifepaths will have any prereqs. In many cases, it's appropriate, though. Examples of things that make good prereqs are age, skill requirements, even time spent in a specific Set or lifepath.<br/><br/>4. Choose Skills, and distribute roll ranges: This requires a bit more explanation than those that come before. Each lifepath has a number of skills you may possibly learn during your time in it. You roll a d20 for each skill point you get in a lifepath, which determines which skills you learn. The first part of this step is to choose which skills, and how many, this lifepath offers. It's not recommended to pick more than 5 skills, though this isn't a hard rule. Once you've an idea of which skills the path offers, you need to distribute them ranges inside of 1 and 20. Again, it's not recommended to give even the most important skill offered a range of more than 5 numbers. Choosing to go outside these recommendations may cause undesirable skill gain results.<br/><br/>Choose Focus Skills: Among the skills you selected above, choose one or two that are focus skills. Focus skills are guaranteed to get at least one point into them when you take the path. Specifically, you spend points from your first year's skill points into each. Thereafter, they're rolled the same as the other skills.<br/><br/>Distribute Skill Points/Year: Each year spent in a lifepath grants 3 skill points. Your task in this step is to determine how many of them are path points, which are rolled in each year for path skills, and how many of them are generic skills, which are spent as the player sees fit on path skills, or skills from the generic skill list. As a rule, you won't be customizing much in this step, as the typical mix of 2 path skill points and 1 generic skill point is strongly recommended. However, if the path includes more time spent learning specific skills, or if it tended to be more generalist, then you might want to vary that mix.<br/><br/>Distribute Attribute Bias: Attribute Bias is what determines the priorities of your attribute pools at the end of lifepath selection. If the lifepath is likely to have toughened the character up, or developed their social attributes, bias reflects that. In brief, the groupings are: Earth = physical strength/hardiness, Water = social graces, Air = mental development, Fire = quickness/precision, and Void = magical attunement. You have 3 points to distribute as you choose amongst the 5 elemental groupings. The primary consideration should be what abilities would most likely develop over the course of the lifepath, but choosing for symbolic association is okay, too.<br/><br/>Determine Minimum and Maximum Duration: The default minimum is 1 year; This is a hard limit. No lifepath may be less than 1 year. There is no default maximum duration. You may choose different values for fictional reasons. A lifepath may mirror an actual job or training, in which there is a minimum time needed to fulfill a contract or gain basic proficiency. A maximum may reflect jobs or positions that require you to advance to another level after a given amount of time. Regardless of maxima and minima, all lifepaths are measured in full years.<br/><br/>Choose or Create a Set: A Set is a grouping of lifepaths that fit together by association or similarity. Example Sets would include the Military and Academia. Sets may have an effect on prerequisites, and do affect when you're eligible for a Transition Event. They may have other effects, determined when the Set is created, and listed under the Set's particular heading. The game has a number of pre-created Sets, but you may feel the need to create your own. It is pointless to create a Set unless you intend to create multiple Lifepaths that fit within it, however.<br/><br/><b>Origin lifepaths:</b> As previously mentioned, these cover a character's birth and first several years of life. They form the foundation for your character's life. As such, they work a bit differently. Like with basic lifepaths, I will begin by listing the steps.<br/><br/>1. Select a name for the lifepath<br/>2. Write a short description<br/>3. Set Duration<br/>4. Choose Skills, distribute skill points<br/>5. Distribute attribute Bias<br/>6. Choose or create a Set, if applicable<br/><br/>Steps 1 and 2 are essentially identical to the corresponding steps for basic lifepaths.<br/><br/>Set Duration: By default, it's 5 years. You may find it feasible to shift this up or down some. Doing so will have an effect on the numbers for Skill points and Attribute Bias. The following steps will use numbers for the default 5 years, so if you modify the duration, you'll want to adjust the numbers accordingly in later steps. Like basic lifepaths, you still get 3 skill points and 3 bias per year, so 15 and 15 by default.<br/><br/>Choose Skills and Distribute Skill Points: Like basic lifepaths, you have a number of skills in an Origin. These should be chosen to be the sorts of things a very young child would learn in that basic lifestyle. Unlike basic lifepaths, there are no rolls for these skills. Instead, the player will simply distribute their points amongst all path skills, with a minimum of 1 in each. Essentially, all Origin skills can be considered focus skills. How many skills they get to distribute in this way works on the same 2:1 ratio as with basic path skill points, so 10 path skill points and 5 generic skill points. Adjust the ratio as you feel is most appropriate.<br/><br/>Distribute Attribute Bias: This differs slightly from basic lifepaths as well, in that you distribute all 15 points at once, rather than per year. It's recommended to spread the points out across the 5 elemental groupings, but you may choose to allot 0 points to groupings if you feel that's most appropriate for the Origin.<br/><br/>Choose or create a Set: Exactly like in basic lifepaths. Time spent in an Origin counts exactly the same as time spent in any other Set lifepath, except in one important regard: Time in an Origin doesn't count toward Longevity or Transition Events at all.<br/><br/>And that's that. Those are the steps required to create a lifepath of either type. The steps and explanations given here might seem like a lot, but once you internalize the concerns for making particular decisions, you'll find that it really is just a matter of filling in the blanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386723/#Comment_386723" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T08:43:53+00:00" title="August  9, 2012  8:43AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fun.

However, trying to compile that list before I have a good, solid pool of lifepaths has ended up feeling backward; Either I go crazy and throw in the Kitchen Sink Repair skill, or I end up having to add skills to the list when I create new lifepaths that show holes in the list. <br/><br/>Regarding genre, I did, in fact, forget to mention that. My apologies. For now, think generic medieval/fantasy lifepaths. The setting of Mage Blade will have some unique cultural stuff, but I can't expect people to create lifepaths for the unique elements without familiarity with the setting first.<br/><br/>Sets are primarily for logical grouping. An example of a Set would be "Soldier", which would include paths such as conscript, footman, sergeant, cavalryman, archer, etc. There is little mechanical impact. The only times they'd matter mechanically is if you create a path (such as Sergeant) that requires X number of years spent in the Soldier set. There are also (as mentioned at the bottom) events based on time spent in a particular path/set, and transition from one path/set to another. For instance, if you spend 5 years as a Soldier, you get to define an event that occurred in that time. When you transition from a Soldier lifepath to, say a Tradesman lifepath, you'd get to define a transition event. This isn't especially important to creation of Lifepaths, but it helps explain why Sets are useful.<br/><br/>In this, I'm trying to keep a low barrier to entry, and not require people to have a knowledge of the setting or the other game rules. Therefore, everything you need to know to help me out here should be contained in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386727/#Comment_386727" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T09:07:02+00:00" title="August  9, 2012  9:07AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you considered cribbing stuff from Burning Wheel?

The system and its goals seem very similar to BW - which is good, obviously, as it's an interesting system either way. It seems to me that I could convert a full set of lifepaths for you from BW in a couple of hours by simply assigning random skill acquisition tables (good idea by the way) to BW lifepaths.

In general, I figure most life paths will be somewhat more general, but not too general. Maybe "Underworld" could be a set that includes burglar, pickpocket, etc, con-man. Your examples make me think of special, deliberate training. A normal pickpocket could augment his skills with a little illusion magic, or a con-man could use magic to read his marks' minds. Wyrmtaster, Shadowcloak and Gleener, on the other hand, suggest that there's a particular organization that deliberately teaches you to handle snakes in addition to mixing and administering  poisons, and how to bend shadows alongside your training at the dip. So I would more expect the players or GMs to come up with these lifepaths to suit their particular game involving the underworld of some major city than have them be pre-generated choices. Still, stat them up. I'm curious to see where you go with them.<br/><br/>Also, a note regarding magic: Magic is relatively common. Everyone, with a few exceptions, has the capability to learn and use it, though it does take training. So, it would be reasonable to expect that a lowly footman might know a few spells he can use in battle, and a farmer may have spells to ease the growing of crops. There are some formal institutions of magic as well for those that want to specialize, but there are also organizations that incorporate magic into broader skill sets.<br/><br/>Regarding Sets... I'm not completely convinced, but I think that each lifepath should be part of a single Set. If it feels like it could be part of more than one, I think you need to go ahead and make the decision as to which it feels more like. Your examples could be arcane, but the magic seems to be in support of the criminal activity, so it seems obvious that they're part of the Underworld Set, rather than the Arcane set.<br/><br/>Peter,<br/><br/>I debated giving an example before, but decided against it largely because I wanted to see how clear the text was without an example. I will give one at the end of this post, though.<br/><br/>Alex,<br/><br/>I like it. Non-generic, but interesting. <br/><br/>Tommi, <br/><br/>Your skills are a little iffy. The first two I think would be covered by a single death magic skill. The rest are solid, but would need to be genericized a bit.<br/><br/>Freeform requirements: I'm going to say yes, but. Yes, but there needs to be a way to say that you did or didn't meet the requirement as part of character generation. In the specific case of your examples, I would rule that the player would have to define an event that met the requirement. <br/><br/>Negative attribute bias: I'm going to say no, simply because I could see circumstances where you'd end up with a negative number at the end.. Though really, thinking about it, that could still work, because the biases are ranked numerically, and you can still do that with negative numbers. Still, I can see things getting a little funky, with you having -1F, -1W, +5E kind of stuff. So, I'm going to stick with no, for now.<br/><br/>Duration: You have to set a minimum (default 1 year), but you do not have to set a maximum. Maximums are only for saying that after X number of years, you have to move on to something else. If you don't think the life path has a maximum duration, then it doesn't.<br/><br/>Example character: <br/><br/>Name: Sergeant<br/><br/>Description: You're a veteran of many battles, and you've proved your mettle both as a soldier and as a leader of men.

I'm noting a trend, at least among the S-G crowd, to just treat hours like currency, rather than literal hours. I don't think that the people over in Eero's thread took 12 minutes to come up with their encounters, either. It didn't take me half an hour to exchange e-mails with Sebastian and discover that I wasn't really going to be able to help him out. <br/><br/>To me, it's worth an hour, literal or otherwise, to get a lifepath created. It's more than just the amount of work, it's the various fringe benefits of these getting done. At this point, I can take these, slap them into a file, do some editing, and I've got nearly a dozen lifepaths done. Then I tell myself that it doesn't really take that much, and I bang out 3-4 more. Maybe I can actually start working on this, do a few each night. All I needed was the push start.

You put more thought into the supporting skills of each field of craftsmanship than I probably would have, and that's definitely a plus. <br/><br/>Jonatan: At first, I kind of frowned at the idea of a generalized professional builder, due to the sometimes ridiculously extreme level of specialization during the middle ages... But then I remembered that this is fantasy, and I kind of doubt that the game is going to revolve around the intricate interactions of the various trade guilds (though I suppose it could!). I like it. Plus, I can see how a lot of those skills could be useful for someone who "used to be in construction".<br/><br/>Of course, I'm starting to go into debt.

The initial idea for skills actually included <i>fractions</i> (i.e. you get 1/3 points of Swordsmanship per year, round down, so you'd get a point of Swordsmanship every three years) but aside from the clunkiness of having to keep track of fractions, there was the odd effect where you'd try to optimize your lifepath lengths so as to not have fractions you'd have to throw away, plus it didn't stop you from minmaxing for the skills you wanted anyway. (ie, take 10 years of bodyguard to maximize your Swordsmanship skill) This system, while it's got its own clunkiness, allows for a broad range of possible skills, and it allows for the things you learn along the way to affect your choices later in life. <br/><br/>Say for instance you have this concept of a farmboy who saw an adventurer come through town, and thereafter decided that's exactly what he wanted to be. So when the local lord comes looking for conscripts, he volunteers. Unfortunately, it turns out that he doesn't learn as much about swords in his initial 4 years as a soldier as he wanted, so he hires on as a merchant's guard, where he picks up a little more, but still ends up spending most of his time glaring ferociously, and less time on swordplay. Eventually, he saves up enough money, and approaches a swordmaster to learn, and finally he's about to become a competent swordsman and go on adventures. Along the way, he's picked up a lot of skills that he might not have, if he'd seen more combat in his soldiering days.<br/><br/>I want people to be able to create the characters they want, but I want the system and even a little Chance to push the character into new directions, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387600/#Comment_387600" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-20T20:45:42+00:00" title="August 20, 2012  8:45PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Name: Assassin (Underworld)<br/>Description: You are a hired killer, valued for your the ease and guile you can execute your assigned quarry.
