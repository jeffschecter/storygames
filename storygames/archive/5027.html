Not necessarily a new mechanic or anything, but just musing about the concept in general.  That lead me in some potentially-neat directions.<br/><br/>First, I thought about the basic sense of "self-sacrifice:" You're hurt or killed in order to help someone else out.  But, then I started thinking about some other ways of thinking that, and I came up with this matrix while walking home yesterday [Edited for clarity: which is only about the results of self-sacrifice]:\n<table border="1"><tr><td></td><th>Helper is harmed</th><th>Helper comes out unscatched</th></tr><tr><th>Action is helpful</th><td>Typically what we thing about "self-sacrifice"</td><td>Moments where the Helper is lucky</td></tr><tr><th>Action is unhelpful</th><td>Tragic futility of action, though the Helper isn't around to experience it</td><td>The same futility, only able to be experienced in full by the Helper</td></tr></table>\nBut then I chewed on how that might not match <em>intent</em>, and here's where segments of this could match up with truly suicidal actions.  Here's a matrix of intent:\n<table border="1"><tr><td></td><th>Helper wants to survive</th><th>Helper is apathetic about survival</th><th>Helper wants to be harmed</th></tr><tr><th>Helper wants helpfulness to succeed</th><td>The standard intent most folks have when they want to accomplish something</td><td>This is a "typical" zone of self-sacrifice, though it can drift into "wants to survive, but knows it won't happen" territory.</td><td>The Helper embraces self-destruction for a positive goal</td></tr><tr><th>Helper does not care about helpfulness</th><td>Here's here the Helper might actually not be <em>trying</em> to help someone else, but might end up doing so anyway.</td><td>Nearly true apathy, maybe?  It's hard to see this as <em>action</em>, but it could be deliberate non-action, like deciding to stop running and let yourself be bait, maybe buying someone else time. *shrug*  That could get into the next category.</td><td>Here's where the ugly side of self-destruction rears its head, where the goal is to be harmed or killed for its own "reward."  (And that's where suicide comes in.)</td></tr></table>\nI don't know if this is helpful or strikes thoughts with others or if I'm off-base with this, but I figured I'd share it.  For me, the interesting parts start when you map various intentions to various results.<br/><br/>What do ya'll think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113324/#Comment_113324" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T10:42:08+00:00" title="December 10, 2007 10:42AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the part where the helper wants to be harmed.

Sorry, I misunderstood "second option."  Okay, so, for "Helper wants to be harmed" + "Helper does not care about helpfulness," this isn't a sane thing to pick.  This is either suicide or a lesser form of self-destruction.  As I said in the other thread, suicide is ultimately a selfish act of escape, and people don't pick it in usual circumstances.  Often, desperation or self-loathing are required to get that far.<br/><br/>So, let's take that idea, and have that be the intent behind an action.  It's not a "self-sacrifice" action, but here's where it <em>could</em> get interesting:  happenstance could cause it so that the <em>result</em> of that action benefits someone else.  Take a dinosaur survival horror story -- a character just lost his wife and child to the beasts, and he's with a group that's running to the boats when he trips and falls.  That's the last straw, and he just decides to not get up.  This isn't because he wants to buy time for the rest of the group, but just because he's capital-D-Done.  However, that action <em>does result in</em> buying time for the group.  His suicide has had the effect of self-sacrifice, even though that wasn't even part of the initial action.

The person who doesn't so much want to die, they just don't want to make the choice anymore. Fleeing from anger and eating the gun are both conscious choices. Giving up and allowing someone/something else (including fate/chance) to decide your fate for you is different from the above category, as it's more of a "non-action," although playing a round or two of Russian roulette falls in this category (#2), as does giving up in the face of adversity.<br/>[surrender of decision-making category]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113570/#Comment_113570" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T10:59:59+00:00" title="December 11, 2007 10:59AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been pondering that divide, Johnstone, and I wasn't sure if that would be splitting hairs too much to be useful.  The surrendering element is interesting, and I hadn't thought about it in quite those terms.<br/><br/>It also occurs to me that the "clean" box model is broken if we look at one box in particular:  "Helper wants to survive" + "Helper wants helpfulness to succeed" -- to relating those two intents:<br/><br/>"Helper wants to survive" &gt; "Helper wants helpfulness to succeed" -- The Helper wants to help, but his own survival is paramount, so if there's a situation where he has to be harmed for help to succeed, it won't happen.  So, this isn't self-sacrifice unless he ends up getting harmed anyway, but is able to pull off helpfulness in spite of that.  But, again, he'll avoid that situation, so self-sacrifice won't be intentional.<br/><br/>"Helper wants to survive" = "Helper wants helpfulness to succeed" -- Honestly, my brain is a bit fried here, and can't think of a good example.<br/><br/>"Helper wants to survive" &lt; "Helper wants helpfulness to succeed" -- This, I think, is the classic "mother saving her child" scenario, rather than what I proposed above.  Sure, she wants to survive, but getting her child to survive is more important.  Without harm, this is merely a "selfless act," but with harm it becomes "self-sacrifice."  We could even call this something like "constructive self-sacrifice," opposed to the "destructive self-sacrifice" that is just giving up and letting yourself be eaten by the monster in order to intentionally buy time for others -- the key difference here being on the "intent with survival" axis.<br/><br/>But, I'm also kinda tired, so maybe I'm deconstructing this too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113668/#Comment_113668" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T15:44:29+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  3:44PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, I find the best policy is to take hair-splitting as far as it can go, then go back and edit out what isn't needed.<br/><br/>For rules that might help you out - see the rules for magic in Unknown Armies, especially Entropomancy (self-risk), and Epideromancy (self-harm), and also the suicide rules in the Burning Wheel setting Under a Serpent Sun (hey nice interview in ep20 btw), which are not exactly self-sacrifice, but definitely show a benefit for purely self-destructive suicide.<br/><br/>Surrendering to chance would be perfect for gaming, seeing as players do this all the time with their characters - putting their character's life into the hands of the dice.

But in general I agree with that process.<br/><br/>You're definitely speaking my language by mentioning Unknown Armies, but that brings up a different can of worms, where self-sacrifice = self-empowerment, opposed to the earlier assuming of self-sacrifice = benefit to another.  I also find that idea of equating surrendering to rolling the dice <em>utterly fascinating.</em>  Man, that's good stuff.<br/><br/>(I'm glad you enjoyed MP <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2320&amp;Mode=like">#20</a>.

But, to get all extreme here (X-treme Sacrifice!  Watch as Air Macklin does a curly 360 table-cross sacred cow sacrifice!), apathetic is "Whatever. Life Sucks." and willfully self-harming as "Do Wanna Die!"<br/><br/>Hmm.  Yeah, I guess that is pretty much the same -- maybe a somewhat different headspace for the character, but the same intent for these purposes.  And I like the simplified English in your titles, Joe.
