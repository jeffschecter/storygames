The game is basically what would happen if 4chan, Secondlife, and Tumblr existed in the physical realm. Strange things can or should happen constantly, thing like convincing people to give you their giant metal cupcake so you can turn it into a flying hot-rod. <br/><br/>Mechanically, the PCs will need to work together if they want to come out ahead in Flow. This hadn't been totally clear while reading it, but doing challenges as a group is cruicial.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's more, but that's what I got out of the time I played it. I didn't find it as scary as some others do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398520/#Comment_398520" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T13:37:04+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  1:37PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2012 1:38PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are a few things I plan to do next time I play:<br/><br/>- Diversify Experiences during character creation.  When it comes time to pile all the characters into a Challenge, I prefer the creative challenge of roping in tangentially-related skills over the creative challenge of roping in redundant skills.  I also like to have a variety of starting points from which to choose and begin Challenges.<br/><br/>- Make sure someone has Negotiation.  Making and fulfilling contracts is both fun and beneficial.<br/><br/>- Conceive a MRCZ that's actually offering something I think is valuable.  Playing a cynical scam artist or idle fad-monger is less fun for me than an earnest craftsman or service provider.  The more you can envision (and get excited about) a path to success for your MRCZ, the more engaging its ups and downs will be.<br/><br/>- Suggest that the SuperUser start by coming up with an interesting client for the MRCZ's services.<br/><br/>- Clarify to the group that the fictional scope of a Challenge will often be incredibly flexible.  A Printing Challenge, for example, could be played as each character chipping in over a span of minutes, or over a span of months.  My point is: when you're looking for ways to contribute to a Challenge, don't limit yourself.<br/><br/>- Clarify to the group what's going on fictionally with the Efficiency stuff during Challenges.  Basically, the Aggregate is aware of everything you ever do, and the more bang it sees you getting out of the station resources you spend, the more station resources it'll give you next time.  Some of my Challenge decisions felt very artificial and mechanical until I figured that out, and it bugged me.  That might just be me, though.<br/><br/>Beyond that, what Thark said.  Hope this helps!  Let us know how it goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398551/#Comment_398551" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T21:19:58+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  9:19PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a review that will probably overwhelm you and cause burnout!<br/><a href="http://wearelostinplay.com/2012/11/freemarket/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wearelostinplay.com/2012/11/freemarket/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398559/#Comment_398559" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-24T01:16:16+00:00" title="November 24, 2012  1:16AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Rasmus,<br/><br/>Looks like you've probably already played, but if you could narrow the scope of your question a bit I might be able to help you out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398562/#Comment_398562" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-24T03:30:03+00:00" title="November 24, 2012  3:30AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for the advice!

I was the only one who had read the game and we must have spent over an hour talking back and forth about how stuff worked, the layout of the station, etc. <br/><br/>The players ended up with a MRCZ that was working against the systems of FreeMarket. Personally I would have opted for creating rather than destroying but the path the players chose made for an entertaining game.<br/><br/>The mechanics for conflicts worked out very smoothly and after a few goes at it the players were confident in how the system worked, so no problem there.<br/><br/>As a Superuser I wanted to let the players and their goals guide the story but we started off really slowly and the players fel stranded, overwhelmed by the amount of choices available to them and for a moment paralyzed in trying to work out how to further their agendas. I ended up throwing some encounters with (in my oppinion) interesting characters and events and once they got the hang of what they were trying to achieve they cleverly used almost all of these seemingly random elements towards furthering their cause.<br/><br/>The freedom and the possibilities of the setting were intimidating at first but next time I suspect the players will be prepared for the challenge!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398644/#Comment_398644" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T10:01:03+00:00" title="November 25, 2012 10:01AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2012 1:56AM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the Memory Mashup is super important in the beginning while folks are getting their bearings--you need to throw interesting things that they can't avoid at them.

I think a lot of players have this tendency to want to subvert Freemarket as soon as they encounter it, because they're too cynical for its utopianism or are interested in playing rebels against the system or hate Facebook or whatever. That's cool, but it makes for a somewhat short arc of play. I think it's better, as has been pointed out, to play it relatively earnestly first -- as a group trying to get by at an honest labor -- and then let group friction and jadedness build up over time, culminating later in the game. Also, I think it's important to realize that MRCZs kinda come and go. There's no reason to commit to the same one or even the same set of characters for the entire game. I almost wish the game gave you several characters, so you wouldn't feel so invested in a particular project or group.<br/><br/>I also wish the game had a "random MRCZ generator" or something that made it easier to populate the station with craziness. Maybe use the insane tables from Refuge in Audacity? In general, I found the job of the Superuser to be pretty exhausting. The players and their MRCZ certainly drive the game, but it's up to you to play the rest of the station, including all the inhabitants, their various levels of Flow, their weird desires and hobbies, the other MRCZs, etc. And there's not a lot to help you track all that stuff and play it with any sort of integrity; I found I mostly just had to make it up.<br/><br/>Also, map the station as you go! I wish there was a better tool for this too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398651/#Comment_398651" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T12:44:32+00:00" title="November 25, 2012 12:44PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David_Berg: J_Walkon nailed it down pretty good in his post; a few of the players immediately wanted to destroy the utopia as quickly as possible and that became the focus of the game. I tried to nudge them into a more "constructive" trajectory but I would never force an agenda on my players unless the game explicitly tells me to, and in the end the game was really enjoyable for everyone.<br/><br/>David_Berg: I see FreeMarket as a fishtank and and i agree that thesupport for juggling MRCZ, agendas, relationships, trends, etc to make the station come alive is limited. Next time I will prepare lists of MRCZ, trends, events and characters to throw in when i need them, I had to create MRCZs on the fly which caused some minor delay when the players started asking for tags and descriptions.<br/><br/>We did some mapping but as our time was very limited the drawing wasn't prioritized but I do look forward to a longer series of games, mapping out the donut and it's realitionships!<br/><br/>Thanks for all the advice, it really helped!<br/><br/>oh, and a small concern:<br/><br/>What happends if I switch two individuals and then perfectly deaths one of them?

Your needs are met, you get to stay unless you're a dick, and the rest is just a quest to add surplus value.  Adding value is hard, and getting props for it is harder still, but so what?  Fundamentally, it's still like having all the time in the world to work on the coolest art project you can come up with.  PARTY!<br/><br/>I must confess I haven't read the whole book or played one character beyond 2 sessions.  If the book tells the SuperUser to make the characters' lives miserable based on their MRCZ Tier, then never mind.\n<blockquote>What happends if I switch two individuals and then perfectly deaths one of them? Would the mistaken key cause a copy of the person till living to be created? What about the person deathed, is he lost?</blockquote>Oh dear.  Maybe Luke or Jared has a ready answer for you.  If I was winging it, I would say that, (1) yes, the deathed person would have 0 active copies and the switched person would have 2, BUT (2) that's temporary, as the deathed person's key info still resides in the system, and can be accessed and uploaded as soon as foul play is detected.  So it probably won't be too long before their friends/family look into it and the Aggregate spots the anomaly.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398654/#Comment_398654" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T13:21:48+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  1:21PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, there's nothing telling the Superuser to push hard against the PCs. You're just supposed to play the station with some degree of integrity to its concepts, I think, and let the users do whatever they do and meet whatever situations that causes. It's pure sandbox in the most real sense. I suspect that the jadedness and friction will build up over time mostly due to the inherent cynicism and dissatisfaction of the players, plus the limits of utopianism. You know how, like, in every utopian fiction ever, there's something fundamentally wrong or some freedom that has to perish in order for the utopia to work? Freemarket likes to say that doesn't happen there, but it's not strictly true (as becomes clearer the more you play the game) and the players are likely to sense injustice or feel trapped by the system even when it's set up to let people do whatever they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398658/#Comment_398658" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T14:40:37+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  2:40PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But the second copy wouldn't have any memories due to the nature of memories?

The station is about Flow. If you rebel against the Flow economy, you can't really do anything.<br/><br/>2. The station is also about the hierarchy of MRCZs. You pretty much have to work to improve your MRCZ's position, if you want better space, more resources, etc. And to do that, you have to play along with the Aggregate, rather than resisting it.<br/> <br/>3. Due to the ephemeral nature of everything on the station, it can be hard to feel like you've accomplished anything permanent and lasting (aside from moving your MRCZ up the hierarchy). Even if you do something huge, it's a very "what have you done for me lately?" kind of place. Continually coming up with newer and bigger schemes and puts pressure on the characters.<br/><br/>4. Sometimes the social currency economy of the station can seem kinda petty and bitchy, just like Twitter, Facebook, or internet forums where you talk about roleplaying. Especially with frownies and the like, there's this pressure to do what the masses want from you.<br/><br/>All of these are part of what gives Freemarket its unique flavor and provide structure to the insane freedom, but IME players and their characters keep bumping into them because it takes a while to really wrap your brain around how a society without death and limited resources actually works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398699/#Comment_398699" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T23:39:17+00:00" title="November 25, 2012 11:39PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2012 11:47PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha.  We're seeing the same things, just parsing them differently.  Maybe the game premise just puts me in an optimistic mindset!  The way I look at it is:<br/><br/>1. If you do your best to do cool stuff, and don't screw anyone over, your Flow will take care of itself (at least, enough to not get kicked off the station).<br/><br/>2. Having worse space and fewer resources than the next MRCZ isn't a big deal.  Moving up is nice, but there's no pressure to do so from anything but your own ego and ambition.<br/><br/>3. All your accomplishments are ephemeral, but hey, that's the life of an artist!  Once you touch someone with your work, that's forever a thing that happened, even if it isn't commoditized as a Long-Term Memory.  And you don't need eternal adoration to pay the bills, so when your masterwork's forgotten, whatever; make a new one!  Then go relax and have sex with androids or something.  I suppose that with extended play, a lack of direction and progress might begin gnawing at me, but we're talking, like, <i>dozens</i> of sessions here...<br/><br/>4. I've long since come to terms with the fact that the connection between <i>what I think is cool</i> and <i>what my society values</i> is weak and unpredictable.  There are gonna be fads that I think are dumb, and things I love that get ignored; oh well.  This unpredictability is what makes human communication endlessly interesting.  As for "petty and bitchy", FreeMarket seems like a huge step up from the real world, in that the Aggregate does its best to give you Flow for actual value added.  No friggin' Paris Hiltons.  Unless I'm misremembering a mechanic about having high-Flow friends being good for your Flow...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398701/#Comment_398701" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T23:47:51+00:00" title="November 25, 2012 11:47PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rasmus, I hope my blather above is adding to the thread!  If you want me to cool it, just say so.  As far as this:<blockquote>But the second copy wouldn't have any memories due to the nature of memories? Is it still a person without any of it's memories?<br/><br/>The idea came from a player looking for a way to cheat the system and permanently kill off freemers. I guess that the "mistake" of having duplicate copies of the same person will be discovered but can you actually persuade the aggregate that the one holding the key at a given moment isn't it's rightful owner?</blockquote>Again, I am far from an authority on the game, but just brainstorming, what I'd say is:<br/>- If the Aggregate can move Memories, it can probably copy them too.  Accordingly, the second body has a second copy of the same Memories.  Congrats, Mr. Switch-in, there are now two of you!<br/>- Once a Switch is detected, I'd assume the Aggregate would try to overwrite the switched-in Key with the switched-out Key.  Or maybe just death all the involved bodies and start from scratch.  If one of the involved bodies couldn't be found, however, that would pose an interesting conundrum...<br/><br/>Jonathan, it now occurs to me that the presence in the game of Breaking, Switching, Ghosting and Wetwork kinda screams at the players <b>"You may want to break paradise."</b>  I just never took the bait.  Seems like a waste.

A memory can be bled into data, thus converting it into information, and copies but when flooded back into a sentient being the memory can only exist in one place. Even if you make six copies of the bled data and tried to flood it into six different people the memory would only exist in one of them (the first one to recieve it if I'm not mistaken). And yeah, conundrums :P<br/><br/>Rick: You may be right but that's not how I interpereted the game text. The constant strive towards earning Flow enough to fulfill your goals is ever there, even though flow is earned partly through selfelss actions, and there is no shortage of theives, and killers on the station. It is a strange economy but still economy and the guys at the bottom want to take part of the resources in terms of space, bandwith and technology of the top MRCZs. I agree to that the system strives to remove the influence of greed, envy and selfishness but the players are hit equally hard by these regulations and if they refuse to play ball (even playing ball for the sake of tearing down society for which there are example groups in the game text) they wont get far. <br/><br/>But: Even though I do not agree on that the game sends this message the bagage of players who haven't fully bought the fiction might do so. As soon as we started talking about utopia there were ideas aired for how to destroy it or not be part of it. Perhaps a game will head the path you suggested in the long run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
