I'm copying it here, since it deserves its own thread. Thanks, Raisin!\n<blockquote><br/>I don't know if WoDu is still hype those days, but I for one really love its concepts, even though I only ran it using group text conversations on Skype for some reason. Anyway, I'm going to run World of Shadows or some kind of Mohawk &amp; Mirrorshades old school Cyberpunk game soon, and the Harm mechanic that Paul_T suggested helped me a lot dealing with the damage and hit points part, that I had trouble swallowing last time I ran the game, so thanks for that!<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>I'm currently doing an experiment to help me get better at structured improvisation (structured as opposed to on the fly improvisation which fueled most of my GMing life before, with sometimes great, sometimes less great success) : using the WoDu basics, I'm trying to design a setting using only mechanics to do so. Everything I write or say about the setting and game must be either through mechanics (like, one of the stat is called Sugar, it is used when the surnatural or the wireless net is involved, and is also the name of the drug people must take if they wish to keep interacting with spirits or surviving being connected to the net), or stated during my turn as the MC (when narrating, which here consists in being the perceptions of the characters, meaning I don't explain things more than the characters' would need to). Of course, the monsters' moves from Dungeon World is a great help to that effect, but as are old timey Random Tables that are the perfect excuse to populate various landscapes, or determine which kind of landscapes can be found in this world.<br/><br/>I started doing that when I realized how hard it was for me to GM Powered by the Apocalypse games with players that aren't familiar with "story games", since it actually provides great tool for narration, but not anything that could be used to be lazy (like, for exemple, a combat system that stays mostly out of the fiction). <br/><br/>Which brings another question in order to this not be a simple comment-question thing : does WoDu (and maybe PbtA games in general) give you more or less work as a MC/GM than a "trad" game? Did it help you improve in some way your gaming life, and if yes in what way?<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Raisin" title="Raisin"><img alt="Raisin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Raisin">Raisin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445401/#Comment_445401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-29T12:48:56+00:00" title="May 29, 2015 12:48PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Paul!<br/><br/>When I say that it's hard, I'd specify that I mean I need to be even more focused and make tons of effort into the game in order to keep it flowing, which is kinda exhausting after a four hours sessions. Which makes me think it's probably the reason the game advises to play for around three hours, more than four or +.<br/><br/>It doesn't prevent the fun, but it makes it very, very hard-earned. I'd think it might have been intentional, then I remember the few sessions I did with experienced people (the ones who introduced me to RPGs are all between fifty and seventy years old, and started in they're teens), and how it was such a blast of awesome interactions and tension and, well, Fun, and it ends up being very frustrating when I can't enjoy it as much with younger (but more available and, well, close since I play with my friends instead of staying in a group of friends that knew each others for most of they're lives) players, and worst : they don't enjoy it as much as my older players, since I can't keep up with the game and they get confused at what we're supposed to be doing and on and on.<br/><br/>For WoDu, it flowed better since its modern nature is almost hidden from the players who don't read the rules and trust the GM entirely on what happens when the dices roll, so players were having as much fun as I expected, which is great, and so even though it needed a lot of work, the reward was worth it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445425/#Comment_445425" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-31T01:36:05+00:00" title="May 31, 2015  1:36AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the same since it's (almost) entirely a traditional game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Raisin" title="Raisin"><img alt="Raisin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Raisin">Raisin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445426/#Comment_445426" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-31T02:11:06+00:00" title="May 31, 2015  2:11AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you mean AW or WoDu?<br/>If AW, I'm not entirely sure, but I may be mistaken as what the current definition of a "traditional" game is.

Compared to jeepform or <a href="https://corvidsun.wordpress.com/2006/01/18/kazekami-kyoko-kills-kublai-khan/" rel="nofollow">Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan</a>, AW is an extremely traditional game.<br/><br/>However, to someone who has only ever played D&amp;D4E and those legendary railroady Werewolf scenarios, Apocalypse World presents a definite shift in mindset.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people have experienced a real change at their table when trying to play this game. (I've also seen people play AW while ignoring some of the principles, and it feels entirely like a "trad" game, as many of its unique features become stripped away and replaced with the local GM's particular procilivities.)<br/><br/>I do agree that playing more creatively-intense games (which a lot of indie/story games tend to be) can be more tiring. A lot more tends to happen per unit of time (for instance, a single combat can take up an entire D&amp;D or GURPS session, which may not even require any preparation, whereas a typical AW game requires the GM to bring a lot of ideas, situations, fronts, NPCs, and so on to the table), which can be creatively exhausting.<br/><br/>I remember playing 8-hour sessions of D&amp;D when I was younger (and recently I've sat in on some similarly long-winded "trad" games), but, for instance, when it comes to some of my more recent games, I keep sessions to a fairly strict 1 1/2 - 3 hours, because after that I see signs of burnout in all the players and the quality of the game drops rapidly.<br/><br/>If your players aren't "playing along" (in AW, this means, among other things, answering provocative questions with strong, leading answers, and making strong moves in the game), GMing can be very tiring, indeed. When the players are on the ball, however, it is easy and free.<br/><br/>In a "trad" game played by "trad gamers", I find most groups tend to sit in one zone of that spectrum all the time. They are comfortable there and they can play for hours. <br/><br/>The more creatively open a game is, the more that will vary.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X" title="Charlie_X"><img alt="Charlie_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/513/nSBLNVCY6RNQO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X">Charlie_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445437/#Comment_445437" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-31T19:51:45+00:00" title="May 31, 2015  7:51PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I admit I enjoy the lack of prep, the only thing which stresses me out is having to make myself stop being presumptuous and prepping a story.<br/><br/>In the past I used to prep maybe four or five hours a week for a game which would last maybe a little over half as long as that, often with massive derailments. I loved running sandbox games as it was a good way of adapting to player wants.<br/><br/>Before discovering the PbtA games, I generally set up problems and gave them many tools to solve them without actually solving them myself. With Fronts, it's still possible to do that. I still have very loose prep here and there, but most of it is made so that the players fill out the form properly as we go.<br/>For Monsterhearts I wrote down eight rough session arcs which would introduce concepts one-by-one and then build to a season finale. I don't know what the antagonists (if any) would be or what any of the challenges were, but I had the structure down.<br/>For Dungeon World I would tend to think of a main setpiece monster like a King Mimic who pretended to be a populated tavern or a gigantic ettin who had been turned into a village for kobolds. Then the rest would fall into place going from wherever they were to wherever they needed to go, according to any missions they were given or looked for.<br/><br/>Having players pitch things beforehand is quite nice, too. I had my players draw a natural feature, a civilisation and a mystery/danger onto a map so that we had seeds I could throw in. It was great as it drove investment in that world up a great deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445439/#Comment_445439" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-31T21:41:21+00:00" title="May 31, 2015  9:41PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm lazy in one way and much more active in another.

So that's where I'm coming from with my questions above.  Having NPCs that feel like they "play themselves" is often my go-to if I don't want to constantly feel like big decisions are "all on me".  Other options include just scanning the GM Moves list and picking one, or simply noting two or more ways the current situation could go and then flipping a coin or rolling a die.<br/><br/>By the way, Sugar sounds awesome.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445447/#Comment_445447" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-01T10:06:42+00:00" title="June  1, 2015 10:06AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2015 10:07AM by BeePeeGee.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent's GM advice in Apocalypse World (AW) has really changed the way I GM.<br/><br/>It takes a clear intention to stay away from railroading - I knew this also before but AW helped to focus what I <br/>- should prepare as GM<br/>- should do as GM during game-play<br/>- should avoid as GM.<br/><br/>What I've maybe learned most from AW is to constantly apply pressure on the players, keep them on their toes:<br/>- Building fronts, <br/>- player-vs-player conflicts, <br/>- killing off people/stuff, <br/>- giving hard choices, <br/>-switching spotlight to another player on a cliffhanger... <br/>I'm using this type of GMing in different RPGs.

In a sense. I no longer spend countless hours prepping and laying plans that, let's face it, never survive contact with the players anyway. on the other hand, PBtA makes it harder and more intense to gm, because i really have to think on my feet, and constantly mentally prep thirty seconds ahead, imagining possible outcome based on player actions. <br/>I don't always succeed, but I'm no longer afraid to simply ask my players either. If anything, PBtA has taught me to trust that my players are as invested as I am in seeing great scenes unfold. Hell, if I have trouble thinking of a bad enough consequence, I can definitely trust the failing player to come up with something far worse than I would. I'm too nice.<br/>If anything, really, I find it harder to GM PBtA than trad games, because I have to be <i>creative</i> all the time. I have to react constantly and instantly, and I have to cut scenes on a high note, yet leave them wanting more. I get to use for more of my GM'ing techniques than in any other games. It's exhausting.<br/>on a sidenote, we get loads more story progression in three hours of PBtA than in ten hours of trad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445457/#Comment_445457" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-01T16:11:53+00:00" title="June  1, 2015  4:11PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>PBtA makes it harder and more intense to gm, because i really have to think on my feet, and constantly mentally prep thirty seconds ahead, imagining possible outcome based on player actions.</blockquote>\nWhoa!

I like it, though. <br/>I would say the hardest I've ever had to do was run a fastaval scenario with minimal prep time (half an hour or so) where I not only had to recall what scenes were next, but also play an NPC while being a director-type GM, cutting scenes and such. I was sweating like a maniac.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
