I stumbled upon role-playing games, found them dumb at first, but then I played them some more and got frustrated with some narrow elements (as in: these games don't do peaceful social interaction very well), so I had to make my own. My first serious design was <i>Muu</i>, a poetic little game on peaceful small creatures living in a forest-glen.<br/><br/>2 - I discovered that role-playing games was fun and furiosly effective in engaging both myself and other people. When I saw how deep and dark the games could become, and how light they could make us feel, there were no turning back. I had to explore this media to the core and the fringes.<br/><br/>3 - My artistic agenda is to make games that will change us; you and me and all our friends out there. I will work with any theme and method that allows me to create effective games within this context. I will even make fun games for that purpose. <i>Games for change</i> is my slogan. I do not expect other game-smiths to have similar agendas at all. Some may, but your agenda may differ from mine in any way thinkable, and still be a powerful agenda.<br/><br/>:-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175437/#Comment_175437" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-19T06:32:38+00:00" title="October 19, 2008  6:32AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hey first post !!!<br/><br/>The Reason/How I started roleplaying games seems to have come organically from Gming/Modulewritting/Houseruling Dnd 3.x. I was never one of those one true game people so I just started kicking arround my own little systems and subsystems until eventually I was trying to rewrite dnd so much I was easily into dnd heartbreaker territory. Realizing that I wasn't helping dnd as nearly as much as I thought I was , I started looking up game design stuff, see rest of creation story splashed in various places. <br/><br/>Because I enjoy writting games and playing games, and I find it a creative outlet between short story and novel that I enjoy writting. I also partly do it in some misguided attempt to continue to correct my own writting<br/><br/>My Agenda is the anti agenda, I'm a big fan of the apolitical, of putting the game first and the urge to change , challenge, or sculpt people to match something later, and generally find traditional games a surprisingly source of ideas and inspiration. While I'm not trying to say that games are not political, I am advocating that games not be designed polticial (I find it tends to make them full of suck is my reason, and I hate being preached at)<br/><br/>Hope that helps. <br/><br/>L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_175529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175529/#Comment_175529" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T05:57:30+00:00" title="October 20, 2008  5:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2008 5:58AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Logos!

Well, I started with RIFTS and played in a group that already had a penchant for creating their own offshoots. I went writing up my own suits of robot armor, to weapons, to spells, to entire classes and races. It was loads of fun and really got my creative juices flowing.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 - Why did you continue writing role-playing games? I honestly just fell in love with it. I play games and run games, and every time i play or run a game it makes me want to write. I am also a mechanics-whore and i really got addicted to finding new games and seeing how one dealt with X versus how another system did.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 - Do you have an agenda to your game design? My game agenda is to put my skew on things and I hope others like it enough to make me successful in my goals. I'm currently in layout for Apocalypse Prevention, Inc. which will be my first official release from my own RPG company. Look out for release dates. My second answer would be "Wold Domination!"<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oni<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.thirdeyegames.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdeyegames.net</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175547/#Comment_175547" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T08:07:59+00:00" title="October 20, 2008  8:07AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Well, actually I used to design board games and card games all the time, because I found it to be something enjoyable. I also played a lot of D&amp;D 3.5, and eventually, the two met, and I started designing some RPGs. <br>2. Well, I find that I enjoy RPGs a lot, and I love designing my own content, so I often will create my own system to fit my needs and the needs of my players. Originally, I strayed from card game design because RPGs require less graphic deign, something I'm pretty terrible at, but after a while in the field, I've found that there's something about RPGs I enjoy more than any other form of game. They're just more creative, I guess.<br>3. An agenda? That would be "Game inspired design" by which I mean non RPG games. I think that adding elements from board, card, and video games into RPGs can make for a very fun experience if done right. My goal is to do it right, and bring some new innovation to RPGs.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175553/#Comment_175553" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T08:54:11+00:00" title="October 20, 2008  8:54AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>1 - How did you start writing role-playing games?</i><br>Most everything I've ever enjoyed, I tried creating on my own at some point.

I made it... because the d30 came out, and it's wild range of results suited something madcap. And there was no "competitive" game of which I was aware at the time, so I made that a big element, too (two or more teams of Stooges vying for the same/similar goals).<br>Most recently, I started designing <i>GLASS</i> because I was sick to death of bloated, kludgy, genre-bound LARP live combat systems in my area (and elsewhere). A bit of HERO, a bit of NERO, and much cleaner and less chaotic combat elements... and <i>GLASS</i> was born.<br>Since then, I have had Game Chef motivate me to write a very "anti" RPG, where I tried to break every paradigm of play--you are your character, in a fictive mode; no dice or sheets or stats, all done with plush dolls and markers and knitting equipment; I Will Not Abandon You play, designed to push the real person to face (and hopefully resolve) real life issues. It's <i>For Mature Audiences</i>.<br>Finally, I was playing some Roguelike games, and it occurred to me that something like Universalis could run one... but with stats like DitV... and single player versus a team of GMs who eventually are themselves in competition. <i>ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a></i> was born (and still awaits proper testing).\n<blockquote>2 - Why did you continue writing role-playing games?</blockquote>\nSee above.

WAY too many LARPs exist in a vacuum, booming and busting because of their insistence on home-brewed (i.e. fantasy heartbreaker) rules. Meanwhile, folks who'd be interested in play are (often) driven off by complexity, disparity in efficacy or plot attention, and the Good Ol Level Treadmill. I want to change that--make the d20 (<i>HERO</i>, really) of LARPs, basically.<br/><i>For Mature Audiences</i> - See above.<br/><i>Stacktors!</i> - The Icehouse Game System (pyramids) has over 200 games developed for it... and only one (nar-style) RPG that's sort of half-baked. Until <i>Stacktors!</i> RPG, which is the first trad RPG using only pyramids to play and resolve (i.e. no dice, no character sheet--though cheat-sheets would be common).<br/><i>ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a></i> - Become rich and woo women. Actually, because I see a niche for it--most "roguelike" RPGs take the approach of simulating the random dungeons and loot and such--I take the approach of GMs v. player, each with narrative authority over events in play ("random-like").                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo" title="Daniel Yokomizo"><img alt="Daniel Yokomizo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo">Daniel Yokomizo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175711/#Comment_175711" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-21T15:05:14+00:00" title="October 21, 2008  3:05PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>1 - How did you start writing role-playing games?</i><br/>I always liked designing stuff.

I've calmed down since then.<br/>I think RPG-design is an interesting hobby, and I still like to create stuff not covered in other games.<br/>Since 2006, I started to create 1-page-RPG's, just for the challenge...<br/><br/><b>3 - Do you have an agenda to your game design?</b><br/>I've got no real agenda, besides participating into challenges (such as my <a href="http://tromeur.com/53/" rel="nofollow">53-RPG-in-2008</a> page, or the <a href="http://www.forgesonges.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=86" rel="nofollow">D\xe9miurges en herbe</a> contest in november).<br/>I've got lots of other long-term projects such as <a href="http://tromeur.com/mu/" rel="nofollow">Le r\xe8gne de Mu</a> (Churchwardian fantasy), but also lots of aborted stuff.<br/>I'm not really planning anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175774/#Comment_175774" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T08:01:32+00:00" title="October 22, 2008  8:01AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I do recognize that each game has it's own agenda, kind of.

Each game comes due to a different desire of my own (agenda) and so each game "has" its own agenda in equal proportion to the degree to which my desires can be reflected in it. Some games have major agendas (me and it; ex: GLASS), some have minor agendas (FMA: participate in a community contest; throw out all conventions; make friends), and some are just "cool ideas" that I realize, in developing, have a niche (and thus comes my emergent agenda; ex: A@H was a lark that, now, will probably be my first for-profit game).<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>Now, if I had to have a Meta Agenda For All Game Design Efforts, then it would be simple, and much like my Meta Agenda in life, in general: win friends, influence people, woo women, educate, retire in comfort (not necessarily in that order). After all--that's what's Good in Life (I'm no Conan).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_175824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175824/#Comment_175824" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T13:47:36+00:00" title="October 22, 2008  1:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Must be a gamist agenda, this one: <i>win friends, influence people, woo women, educate, retire in comfort.</i> ;-)<br/><br/>It makes sense, David.
