I'm an English teacher and musician living in The Czech Republic I played AD&amp;D thirty years ago and stopped and only last year returned to role playing. It started when my friend and I decided to play again to help his son practice his English. It was really fun! Very soon after I discovered that there existed story games and I played Archipelago and Fiasco which I loved. Since then I have played Anna the Miller's daughter, Fate and Shooting the <br/>Moon and have yet to try Breaking the Ice, The Quiet Year and Joker's Quest. <br/><br/>I know about Muse, the Clock, the Plant and many of the Norwegian Style games.<br/><br/>I am looking for recommendations for other games to try. I am not really interested in fantasy or science fiction or games for large groups. Solo games and games for two or three people would be ideal. Games like the ones I have mentioned. Any ideas or input is welcome...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blackomatic" title="blackomatic"><img alt="blackomatic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/957/nBAC3DUT7IHUM.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blackomatic">blackomatic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421819/#Comment_421819" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T14:09:02+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  2:09PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me clarify...by fantasy i mean high fantasy: dwarves and dragons and such...i am certainly interested in the fantastic and weird and magical...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421851/#Comment_421851" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T07:08:35+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  7:08AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out Annalise, by Nathaon Paoletta. It's ostensibly a game where you are stalked by a vampire, but it's so much more. The "Vampire" can be any kind of creeping horror, and I find it's best not to define it at all and let it surface throughout play. I've typically played it as modern characters in a modern world (usually urban) and the creeping horror has been everything from revenge-ghosts to cannibalistic ghouls to aliens. It plays well with two or three people (and shares the GM role among all players).<br/><br/>If you like fantasy but hate high fantasy, try out In a Wicked Age, by Vincent Baker. It's swords and sorcery, but of the pulp novel variety, and it's very much a storygame and not an adventure game. You'll want three players and a GM for it.<br/><br/>Sorcerer, by Ron Edwards, is the granddaddy of the modern indie gaming movement (since the 90's anyway). You play a motherfucking sorcerer in a modern world, and you have demons, and they have needs and wants, and you get into trouble if you can't please them, but they give you all your power. It's a hard-hitting Narrativist game and it plays well with two or three people (including the GM).<br/><br/>The new hotness is the collection of *World games (Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, Monsterhearts, and other AW derivatives). Apocalypse World is the original (also by Vincent Baker). It's post-apocalypse madness with a very tight storygaming engine and the best GM-advice/rules ever written down. It's best with a GM and 3-4 players, but I suspect you can get by and have fun with fewer.<br/><br/>Welcome to Story Games!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo" title="Maese_Mateo"><img alt="Maese_Mateo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/897/nVSZHDY85YP2W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo">Maese_Mateo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422361/#Comment_422361" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T05:24:53+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  5:24AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only games for two people I know are <b>S/lay w/Me</b> by Ron Edwards and <b>Murderous Ghosts</b> by Vincent Baker.<br/><br/>That said, I've played a lot of games with only one or two other players, so you can take pretty much anything you like and run with it.<br/><br/>For solo games, I've read good things about Mythic GM Emulator (or something like that), which seems to allow to play without a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422367/#Comment_422367" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T07:01:14+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  7:01AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The only games for two people I know are <b>S/lay w/Me</b> by Ron Edwards and <b>Murderous Ghosts</b> by Vincent Baker.</blockquote>\nChristian Griffen's Beast Hunters is a good (I think!) option for 2.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blackomatic" title="blackomatic"><img alt="blackomatic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/957/nBAC3DUT7IHUM.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blackomatic">blackomatic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422376/#Comment_422376" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T10:44:41+00:00" title="October  3, 2013 10:44AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the recommendations.

Basically, the "I" player chooses a number in the range 4-6 for the Monster, and a number in the range 1-2 for the Lover. What you choose doesn't really matter that much, so it's just best to put something down, see how the game plays, and revise your understanding after a playthrough or two. The only operatively important part is really that the "You" player should not know the Monster score, as it's part of the uncertainty in ending the Match that You doesn't know when the Match ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
