And realised that one of the things is a skin scared of socialising or that is otherwise antisocial.  Possibly also a skin that's ugly enough that people are repulsed on seeing them.  So I came up with The Gorgon - a monster that petrifies anyone they look in the eyes of.  Slowly or it wouldn't actually work.  But I think I have a good socially phobic character here.<br/><br/>It's not as feral as my Deep One - but I don't think I could get a skin that feral again, and I don't think it's bad.  I'm also a move and some names light at the moment (I just can't get Hands of Brass working as a move)<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14a-FgjPHhpP6EFYaXEHlKYKf-ToRpGJQcGI3nRZ3ukU/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/14a-FgjPHhpP6EFYaXEHlKYKf-ToRpGJQcGI3nRZ3ukU/edit</a> (New link to formatted version)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429123/#Comment_429123" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-05T01:45:21+00:00" title="March  5, 2014  1:45AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2014 1:53AM by James_Mullen.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's beautiful, truly. If anything, I would take the idea even further and really push it: there is a bittersweet irony in being rejected for the way you look and not meeting societal norms of beauty, in a game which features werewolves, ghouls and other traditionally disturbing or repulsive beings. How galling that an inhuman monster can find love and acceptance whilst you struggle to overcome the prejudice against your appearance? I'd day that this is a skin for someone who has been made strong by that experience, but still knows how easy it is to be hurt and to hurt others.<br/><br/>How about adding 'cursed' and 'scarred' to the list of origins? I'm drawn to the idea of someone not born this way but who became this as the result of a cruel accident or vicious attack.<br/><br/>I think the interesting thing about the Sex Move is the motivation of their lover: if they truly are accepting the Gorgon and being intimate with them for the sake of love or compassion, then they should be rewarded. On the other hand, if they're being coerced in any way, then there should be some hideous backlash: what if the pity-fuck or dare-fuck causes instant petrification? It's only <i>true</i> affection that can protect you from the Gorgon's curse.<br/><br/>The Darkest Self rocks: I like the exploration of when accepting yourself can cross the line from simply wanting to co-exist peacefully into forcing yourself on other people and demanding that they validate you.<br/><br/>In terms of the moves, I really like the way <b>Petrification</b> works: that slow creeping chill as your flesh and bones start to fuse together... <i>*shudder*</i>. <b>Head full of snakes</b> is a great idea, but it feels like it does a little too much, or at least that too many mechanics are stated: what about instead saying "Your hair looks like dreadlocks to others, but it's actually a nest of snakes, which can bite, pick things up and allow you to see through them." The uses then become implied and can be brought into play through fictional positioning, e.g. "OK, so he's standing behind me and holding my wrists? I bite him with my hair."<br/><br/>I like the flipside of things with <b>Siren's Cousin</b>, but why not tie it into <b>Petrification</b>? If you get +1 to turn on or manipulate someone who is already <i>petrified</i>, then it gives the Gorgon a little more incentive to actually use their power, whilst also implying that maybe the victim is beginning to enjoy the process and to fall under the Gorgon's spell. That might be a bit too much when coupled with <b>You're slowing down</b>, but then one is active while the other is passive and they both fit the theme of your 'ugliness' making you stronger.<br/><br/>I don't really see <b>Slow the body down</b> being central to the skin's concept: it's a nice move, but it feels a bit disconnected from what the Gorgon is about... would it be too much if this was also tied to being <i>petrified</i>? It seems like it should at least make the target <i>petrified</i> as a result, or at least leave them with temporary paralysis.<br/><br/>I like the idea of <b>You shall not pass</b> being a recognition of the strength the Gorgon finds in accepting themselves and it would be stronger if it was clearly about using their appearance to aid their friends, such as "Spend a string on someone to distract them from their immediate target or goal and focus their attention on you; when this assists someone else, they take +1 now."<br/><br/>With <b>Oops!</b>, what are the limits and definitions of 'accidentally'? How much can I metagame this if I'm playing the Gorgon? What would stop me from saying "I look right at him/her, forgetting my curse for a moment; oops, I mark experience," at almost any time? If someone grabs me or otherwise forces me to look into their eyes when I genuinely don't want to, is that an accident? I like the idea of gaining experience through causing pain to others, so maybe it could simply be "Mark experience whenever you permanently petrify someone."<br/><br/>This is a skin I would relish playing and I can think of all sorts of scenes with the Gorgon avoiding the gaze of others because of the pain it causes them when they see the looks of pity, disgust, anger and sympathy on the faces of others, but also triggering feelings of suspicion, mistrust, disappointment and rejection in those same people just because they won't look them in the eyes. I also don't honestly think you're a move short either: there are seven to choose from and most playbooks only have six, so you're already one up and might be faced with the prospect of dropping one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429126/#Comment_429126" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-05T04:41:58+00:00" title="March  5, 2014  4:41AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really good feedback there, thanks!  I've updated the skin, running with a lot of your ideas (and taking another background as a wish-gone-wrong).  Head full of snakes - I always over-complicate first draft.  Oops has been clarified, darkest self cleaned up, You Shall Not Pass simplified.  Slow the body down, yes you're right.<br/><br/>And yes, seven moves is enough.  Six for playbooks with two starting moves, seven for three - which happens when one starting move is either neutral or often a liability (I mis-remembered it as seven for two).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429127/#Comment_429127" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-05T05:00:45+00:00" title="March  5, 2014  5:00AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great: I also forgot to mention earlier how much I like the phrase <i>'Museum of Gorgons'</i>, which is one creepy-ass idea... more shivers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429153/#Comment_429153" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-05T19:36:14+00:00" title="March  5, 2014  7:36PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just produced a formatted version.
