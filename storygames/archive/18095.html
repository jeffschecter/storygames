That\u2019s cool, right?<br/><br/>Apparently, not always. \u201cLet me tell you about my character\u201d is a joke we all know, about the gamer who won\u2019t stop talking to you about how cool such and such a character they made was. I\u2019ve added certain subject-lines to the same category as LMTYAMC: \u201clet me tell you how I broke a game,\u201d or \u201clet me tell you how funny (read: upsetting and dysfunctional) this session was,\u201d or \u201clet me tell you about an improbable result from a randomizer,\u201d to name a few.<br/><br/>Yet, good gaming stories exist. Some of them even share subject lines with the terrible stories above. Whenever I deal with neophyte gamers, I find myself wishing the craft were teachable. The ability to tell good gaming stories also crosses over, crucially, with the ability to pitch games effectively.<br/><br/>A few of the questions I ask myself before telling a gaming story include:<br/>\u2022 Does my audience care?<br/>\u2022 Can I make the story brief?<br/>\u2022 Does my story rely on in-world knowledge, or other unwieldy facts I can\u2019t assume my audience knows?<br/>\u2022 Does my story rely on opinions about games or the hobby (or even something weird like religion or politics) which I can\u2019t assume my audience shares?<br/>\u2022 Does the story have some moral, punch line, or other takeaway which resonates outside of the gaming context?<br/><br/>So what makes or breaks a gaming story? What other questions are useful to ask? Are gaming stories fundamentally different from other stories, or other shop-talk stories?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408819/#Comment_408819" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T08:05:23+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  8:05AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good gaming stories:<br/><br/>- are short<br/>- cut to the good stuff without explaining to me the game world from the dawn of time<br/>- respect my need to go to the bathroom kinda soon and maybe right now<br/>- should be funny, or reveal some essential truth about about someone I know personally or should reveal something interesting about the nature of gaming/gamers or should be about a game I actually played with you.<br/>- have tellers who watch me like a hawk for any signs of boredom.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408835/#Comment_408835" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T11:41:53+00:00" title="March 12, 2013 11:41AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2013 11:43AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>- have tellers who watch me like a hawk for any signs of boredom.</blockquote>\nThis one is an important one for me in general topical discussion of any kind. Most people seem pretty oblivious as to whether or not the person they're talking to has any interest in what they're saying. Like, I feel like I'm pretty keen (maybe even too sensitive?) to the body language and tone of voice of the person I'm trying to discuss something with - I can tell right away when someone doesn't really want to hear me continue to drone on about something I find interesting or funny, so I change the subject to whatever extent seems appropriate and choose not to get butt-hurt (much) about it.\n<blockquote><br/>- are short<br/>- cut to the good stuff without explaining to me the game world from the dawn of time</blockquote>\nThis a lot, too. Gaming stories of the "let me tell you about my character" variety just tend to be inconsequential to those not directly involved. Role-playing games, to me, are a very intimate activity. They're meaningful to the participants of any given session because those people are participating.<br/><br/>Here's an example:<br/><br/>"One time, when we were playing AD&amp;D back in the mid-90's, [snip] my character caught two other characters having sex and declared that they were doing the 'rump-chicken'"<br/><br/>At the time, it was hilarious (we were like 8 or 9 years old?). I was misreferencing another inside joke from the time. If I reminisce about this incident with any of my friends that were there, it would certainly bring a chuckle about. To anyone else who reads that, it makes no sense, it's not funny, it's not interesting. I know this and choose not to retell this story outside of the group who was there, but I've heard TONS of these kinds of stories from gamers who were too oblivious to notice how meaningless it was to me.<br/><br/>Point? The story needs to have something for me to relate to in order to draw interest. "Let me tell you about my character" is a very selfish topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408849/#Comment_408849" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T14:19:23+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  2:19PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, you two nailed it.<br/><br/>I suppose the only thing missing is that the *telling itself* can have value. For instance, I have no particular reason to be interested in <a href="http://www.theschoolforheroes.com/questlog/692/the-tale-of-eric-and-the-dread-gazebo/" rel="nofollow">Eric and the Dread Gazebo</a> except that it's a pretty funny story, and unusual for its humour value. I enjoy it, because it makes me laugh (which, in return, is because I can relate to it somewhat, of course, but I think it's at least a little funny to anyone just because it's about people miscommunicating in a funny context). I don't enjoy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO49YD_vWI" rel="nofollow">this version</a> very much, though, because of the monotonous delivery.

That would be: <br/><br/>1) If I didn't have kids so I couldn't relate on that level<br/>2) If I wasn't a fan of WoDu or didn't know much about it so I couldn't relate on that level<br/>3) Blake included a bunch of monotonous, mundane, and unnecessary details that were probably interesting to him but otherwise forgettable<br/>4) It was poorly retold verbally and broken up by lots of stammering "um", "uh", "like", and repetition/pauses due to him losing his train of thought or forgetting words/names<br/><br/>Assuming whatever story someone is telling me is interesting on some level (maybe it's funny, it's poignant, or I can relate), then the biggest problem I've run into in the past are numbers 3 and 4. It's hard to follow someone when they're stammering on and on about something nerdy, I'll tell ya.<br/><br/>From the teller's point of view, there's also the whole thing where you start talking about something because it seems relevant or interesting in your head when you think about the big picture, but then realize half-way through that you're sucking at telling the story or it's not really as funny/interesting as you first thought or the person looks bored, so you lose the motivation to continue to tell the story, but don't want to just abruptly stop talking so you try to summarize it (usually unsuccessfully) all of sudden and it just turns out all weird...and..awkward and...err...confusing...well..yeah you get the point. (That!) <br/><br/>I don't know about you guys, but that happens to me fairly frequently in any discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
