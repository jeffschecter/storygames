                    Joy Division is a near-future role playing game of technological horror. Characters are agents of the Joy Division, a small but well-funded transnational espionage agency set up to neutralize major threats from advanced, destabilizing technologies. Characters will use a range of quasi-legal and illegal means - targeted investments, blackmail, commercial espionage, misinformation campaigns, kidnappings - to keep humanity from being wiped out or radically transformed by a coming â€˜singularity.â€™<br/><br/>I wrote the game as an entry for the 2 page rpg design challenge (that seems to have fallen off the face of the earth).<br/><br/>Joshua, Judson &amp; me from our LA games group had a chance to play test it a month or so ago &amp; I wanted to get the lessons down. It was a good session since we changed some rules mid play and had time to run through the game 3 times with narration and a couple more with just dice rolling.<br/><br/>A revised version is at  <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Joy_Division.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Joy_Division.php</a><br/><br/>The game revolves around a set of dice that are on the table to represent the technological menace. Each turn, some of the dice raise up towards 6. When a die hits 6 it will split and two new dice will be rolled. When certain numbers of dice show 6, minor, moderate, and then catastrophic consequences occur (defined before the game by the moderator). Players meanwhile are rolling dice representing the charactersâ€™ efforts, trying to eliminate and capture the menace dice.<br/><br/>The menace in our first game were human-simian hybrids bred to be surrogate mothers and nursemaids. The minor threat was that only poor women would continue to give birth naturally, worsening social inequality. The moderate threat was some kind of monkey pox would jump the species barrier, harming an entire generation of hybrid-birthed kids. The catastrophic threat was (of course) the planet of the apes scenario.<br/><br/>Partway through the game Judson had a great suggestion to change the rules on capturing dice. Originally, when you capture a menace dice one goes into your hand to attack the threat with, the other went to the moderator to roll to attack your character or personal/professional contacts (representing how you were being corrupted by controlling part of the dangerous technology). Judsonâ€™s suggestion was to have both dice go to the player, but everytime you roll, if one of the captured dice gets a 1 or 2, bad things happen. So the strategic choice of the game is how many captured dice you can afford to use and roll. We identified some other changes in terms of how many dice players start with, being able to rejuvenate and adapt between menaces, etc.<br/><br/>Joshua and Judson beat back the monkey-mom threat. Then Judson and I rolled really well and quickly polished off a threat from some machine that could generate pocket universes. Our longest game was fighting a strain of genetically modified corn thad radically extended the human lifespan. We chased that damn corn through India and the subcontinent, across global trade routes, and as it shifted to rapeseed and other grains, then finally saved the day.<br/><br/>The balance of the rules favored the players. Thatâ€™s fine since it allows for episodic play (each game took from 10-30 minutes) although it diminishes the horror aspects.<br/><br/>Ps- I havenâ€™t playtested my other 2 page entries, but if you want to check out a game where characters traits are entirely based on Marxâ€™s Economic and Philosophical Manuscript of 1844 (alienation from labor, from the products of labor, from other people, and from species being), try Satanic Mills <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Satanic_Mills.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Satanic_Mills.php</a><br/><br/>My other entry, Corrosion, has you cut a picture of your character up into a 3x3 grid or puzzle that represents their mental state. <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Corrosion.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Corrosion.php</a><br/><br/>crossposted from forge  (for a reason, too)                </div>

                            I gotta say, this was an <em>awesome</em> game, and when combined with the hyper-concentrated time footprint, the awesomeness reached dangerous density levels.  A full game of Men In Black vs The Singularity in ten to twenty minutes.  Great space-filler.<br/><br/>Eventually, Mark, I'll do it up as a two-sided character / threat sheet that has the rules printed on each side.                        </div>

Tony, the format was quick narration tied to each phase of the game- not deep role playing or carefully staged conflicts. But there was room to insert our characters into the actions and reactions. And as players, we kept knocking the menace down to one or two dice and it was bouncing back - so we got a grudge. In the system the most personal aspect is that your character is elminated from the game if they lose their 2 personal contacts and 2 professonional contacts. You only lose them by being corrupted when you've taken over part of the menace.                        </div>

Joy Division really is ridiculously fun.  At 30 minutes for a long drawn out globe trotting spree of technological horror, it runs really tightly.<br/><br/>In terms of personalization: IIRC, a 2 on one of your corrupt dice (the dice you retained after capturing them) meant that the menace turned one of your contacts against you.  Your contacts are the people in your life that keep you grounded to everyday folks, and the amount to (3, CoC style) hit points. That meant that while there was a lot of high level "I direct customs to seize the corn as it enters Latvia," there was also tragic scenes where close friends turn on you because you want to stamp out the corn that's keeping their aged mother alive.                        </div>

                            Also, the threat is generated off of a list of flags from the players: so corn-of-life was based off of one character's distrust of gengineered food and another character's interest in immortality.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>I know nothing about Chinese music. If you find a link to a joy division song, it would be fun to check it out. <br/><br/>There's also the 70s british band of the same name that was a precursor to new order. <br/><br/>the game's title is a reference to Bill Joy's 2000 article 'why the future doesn't need us.' <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html</a> </div>

Which was a conscious reference by the 80s band.  It's a grab for the game title, but as Mark makes clear in a sidebar is completely unrelated to either band or Nazi sex slavery.                        </div>
