The following actual play is how I remembered it. Do mind that I ended up staying awake until 5 a.m that day, and thus I might miss out a few things, but you get the gist. <br/><br/>We started off with three characters, Grip, Coil and Hull. Grip was the leader of the crew, a former army captain and a natural crew leader. Tall and strong, Grip made all the important decisions. Coil was the seasoned runner vet, a fact all too apparent in the amount of paranormal blowback he'd suffered. His gear sparked at inopportune moments, and he spoke with a mechanical hiss. To finish off the roster, Hull had been recruited. A young maverick of a man, Hull was in charge of the gear - all the drills and saws a runner crew needs these days.  <br/><br/>We dove into the ghostworld, about to enter <i>the ruins</i> in search of <i>paper</i>, information from a time before the Crash. All is fine and dandy when the sonar goes off, and the Dogs are coming! They've been sold out to the government! The crew jumps out of the ghostworld, but Breaker, the operator feels it's too hot and cuts the connection before Grip gets out! He fights the Dogs and the rest of the crew make a daring jump through the datastream and back into the ghostworld. They luckily manage to fight off the Dogs and escape back, but not before Grip gets tagged. This is bad news. Back in the real world, Grip is furious! Breaker is all apologies, but let's it slip that he spoke to Switch down the Six Arms. Grip executes Breaker for his betrayal. The crew now needs another operator, and they need it quick - Sledge, the blacksmith down the Anvilwerks wants his cash back, otherwise Hull's ass is grass: He and the rest of the crew are knee deep in debt to Sledge. <br/><br/>So a plan is formed. Hull's discovered that a government pumping station in the ghostworld has gone offline for a while. That means it's ripe for the picking, but still hott as hell. If the government pick up on a station being robbed, they come with all their guns. Hence the story of the Station.Lol, the one time a stupid as hell runner, high on all hells of Crystals, tried to leech one off. It did not end well, and all runners have heard that story. However, this is too tempting. The crew form a plan - get some new gear, do the Station leech and find a way to show Switch what's what. <br/><br/>Coil ends up in the Strippery, a stip joint (people these days have no sense of poetry), trying to get some info out of Switch's girlfriend, Silla. She's a stripper there, but Coil has a history with her - he's kind of a ladies man. He finds out that Switch has been paid by the govs. That means Switch is potentially a hot biscuit, and probably knee deep in shit of his own. <br/>Grip goes on the search for a new operator, and finds White, Coil's ex-wife and Grip's ex-girlfriend. She's a crystal addict, and a big time one. Grip's run with her before, knows that she's usually bad for business, but he's desperate. <br/><br/>At this point, another player joins - this was a Con, after all, and people come and go. He instantly assumes the role of White, and does some of the best addict-desperation playing I've seen. marvellous.<br/>Grip: "So, White, are you in for this run? It's high risk, maybe the highest." <br/>White: "Sure. Half up front." *White wipes her nose* <br/>Grip: "No deal. All after the fact"<br/>White, without a second's hesitation: "I'll do itlet me do it."<br/><br/>From there on in the action is all high, and I'm vague on the details. Hull manages to convince Sledge to put up for some power batteries, but Sledge also sells them out to the govs (goal and danger comes true. Nifty, that). <br/>It ends with them attempting a station.leech, but it goes awry near the end and they have to escape the gov with just half the loot. Figuring they're too hot - white, white hot - they cash it in with Sledge and agree to meet in New Hong Kong. We end the game there, and finish off with some epilogue, like in Fiasco. Grip never makes it to Hong Kong, and opens a bar instead. White ends up with Switch, but that goes to hell. Her addiction probably killed her. Coil finishes off by having a drink in Grip's bar, before Grip's last scene is agreeing to one, final, never-again-hell-no run through the ghostworld. Hull ends on a high, by impressing the kids, talking about the time he did a Station.Hull op. Hell, why else would it be called a Station.Hull?? <br/><br/>--- <br/> <br/>I really like running Ghost/Echo. The mechanics are solid, and easy to master, two rolls and everyone knows what to do. This time around I had some extremely proficient players who worked together without batting an eye, which not only helped, but also leveraged everything I wanted to do. Carrying on dangers gives me as a GM a great tool to increase my part in the narrative as well, so I just sit back and ask questions to flesh out the environment - I really love creating that mishmash feel of technology and (this time around) 80s popculture.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome" title="AJohandsome"><img alt="AJohandsome" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome">AJohandsome</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365309/#Comment_365309" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T13:14:59+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  1:14PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, bum, Michael was quicker than me in posting.

Ghost/Echo remains, in my mind, as a pedestal in quick game design that just pushes all of my buttons. It's a perfect union of a decent mechanic rooted in cause/effect and just enough flavour to imply not only a setting, but also play style. Great job, Mr. Harper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
