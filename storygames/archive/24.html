                    OK, so that's Rob's topic turned on its head, but still, it's something I think about every now and again. I've tried various MMOs (usually during their demo periods), and have stuck around for too long, they just aren't my thing in their current incarnation. Maybe one day. Anyway, after a binge session of the single player game Morrowind, and thinking about the popularity of MMOs, I've loosely tossed around some things that MMOs bring to the table that maybe our RPGs and Story Games could learn from.<br/><br/><b>MMOs: You can play ANY TIME you are inclined: Someone's gonna be online.</b><br/>Face to face gaming, sadly not so. The instant gratification of being able to log in anytime can be effective countered by having powerful, fun sessions with friends once or a few times a month. The hold MMOs have is a strong one, but I think that with attempting to improve the play experience (through rules, styles of play, play advice, whattevah) people will hold RPGs up as "limited, but (hopefully) quality time". This isn't so much a "thing to learn from" as a "thing we're working against.<br/><br/><b>MMOs are fucking visual as fuck</b><br/>I can describe what my supers character looks like, or I can build him in beautiful, exquisite detail with the CoH chargen engine. MMOs, with their graphics, really can make us feel the grandeur of a palace, the desolation of a desert or wasteland, the danger of fighting on the edge of a cliff, the rush of flying through the air.<br/>What can we learn from this? I'd like to discuss.<br/><br/><b>MMOs are generally easy to get into</b><br/>The rules for chargen and the underlying system can be understood pretty quickly for players of all ages.  The tutorials that you go through in both online and offline games like the Final Fantasy series (where it literally coddles you through your first few battles, revealing more of the system as you go) is certainly a lesson for making a game: Perhaps don't reveal the entire system to the players on the first die roll, but rather have a structured series of events in the first gaming session which gradually expose various aspects of the system. Set it in stone, so that a New GM could run New Players through it, and have the same experience as people on the other side of the world with experienced GMs and Players.<br/><br/><b>Some MMOs focus on boring fucking shit</b><br/>Like in Ultima Online, spending hours digging minerals to eventually sell or make dinky swords with of your own. Fuck that, that's not something we need to learn from... or is it? <br/>First, I think it teaches us to keep Boring Shit to a minimum.<br/>Second, I think it speaks to player authorship of the world.  If some kids will spend 10 hours virtually digging iron out of a virtual cave wall just so that they can make a dagger with its own cool, unique custom look and feel, this "crafting" is just as powerful in face-to-face games. What if in D&amp;D you let the player convert a small number of XP into building unique weapons or spells without all the messiness (finding a smith, making skill rolls, etc), after which you get to describe them to the group and use them to advantage in play. That sounds like a game that "crafters" would be inclined to play, more than a game where all the treasure is found or given.<br/><br/><b>Shared Experience</b><br/>RPGA "Living XYZ" games are basically MMORPGs before MMOs were invented.  Now, with the existence of MMOs, I dunno... Living D&amp;D-based games feel like they're in the shadow of MMOs. However, through them, they can experience the same events together: John in Seattle and Mary in DC can both go through "The Evil Temple in Evermeet" and discuss it online.<br/>Likewise, shared events and places between players is a source of conversation, sharing, discussion and fun. <br/>Sometimes, just the setting and background provides that cross-group sharing: In Exalted, did your players visit Gem?  Did they attack the Great Wood Temple?  In Vampire, did Caine show up in YOUR game? etc<br/>Sometimes, they are tied closer to the gameplay, like in Dogs and their towns (you can create your own on the fly, or take one of the many online and use it): In Dogs, did your dogs go to Whitemore? How about Hell's Hollow? How did they defeat the false priest? <br/>Sometimes it's the scenarios themselves, like those one-shot RPGA events, or Luke's legendary demos.  Who did YOU play in The Gift?<br/>Finally, I see the shared experience really set off in games like Jason's THe Shab al-Hiri Roach, where there are 6 Set Events, and Set NPCs.  That limitation is freedom, and whatsmore it becomes a major, major shared experience for ALL players of the game.  What happened to Regina Sutton in Your game?<br/><br/>There's got to be more things that MMOs do that can make us think more about RPGs, and how to make them more effective at punching people in the face with accessible fun...<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Andy, I think MMO's strong visual appeal is nothing compared to the sparkling world of candy-colored imagination!<br/><br/>And shared experience - I'm all the hell about that.  I realized early on that it was a strength of the Roach and presented entertaining constraints on play - I'll be using it again in Grey Ranks and probably lots of other projects.<br/><br/>As for ease of use, see DitV.

Me, I love it. No MMO really takes advantage of it was well as they could, but there is a lot of power (to me) in, like, WoW's very cohesive look (which unfortunately is a look that rapidly breaks down with characters at the upper levels, but the environments are very strong).                        </div>

With <i>Stranger Things</i>, I'm using a shared pool of keywords for flags and traits (which also link to situation creation). So all games of Stranger Things will share this pool of 60 common elements: chains, keys, silver, smoke, blood, bone, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The map tiles also create a shared world among all game instances, which each group customizes in play.                        </div>

But that emphasizes that point: The "customization of ephemeral elements" (not just "building a powerful weapon", but "building a cool weapon in just the way I like") aspect of MMOs really attracts people... enough so that they'd enter a game built on a universe of action and light drama... and sell fucking hats to IG-88.<br/><br/>Is there something in the RPG world that can pull from this?

<br/>
Feel free to respond to that here. <br/>
<br/>
In response to other stuff here, I think that the "crafting" concept, or generally being able to make indellible marks on the setting - immortality - is attractive as hell, yes. The problem is how in a non-persistent world like a TT RPG, do you create that effect? <br/>
<br/>
Actually I have some ideas for something like this that I'm working on for my latest design. But it's pretty primitive at this point. <br/>

<p>One simple way to obtain "craftng" is by rules alteration. For instance, in Mage: the Ascension, characters can use tools to make it easier to perform magic, if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>You could easily add a crafting mechanic which allows you to define a tool that <em>all</em> mages (or even mortals!) can use - thereby changing the world completely.</p>

                            This one also deserves reviving in the context of 4e.<br/><br/>From the original post.
<blockquote>MMOs: You can play ANY TIME you are inclined: Someone's gonna be online.</blockquote>
The D&amp;D DI will alledgedly offer this. Of course we know what happened with D&amp;D Master Tools, but this time the DI seems pretty core to 4e.
<blockquote>MMOs are fucking visual as fuck</blockquote>
The DI will also apparently do this. Except in a bit of an odd fashion in that you have a digital minature, that's somewhat more customisable. This brings up the point that on this point RPGs can learn from games like Warhammer. It can be a lot of fun to paint your miniatures, work on some detailed battle grounds that you've custom designed, etc. There is of course a huge investment of time, but this also gets a leg up on MMOs - you not only have the visuals, but you also have the tactile aspect.
<blockquote>MMOs are generally easy to get into</blockquote>
I haven't really seen anything from the 4e previews to see that they're doing anything there. But it does illustrate a point that RPGs seem to be designed with existing gamers in mind. When was the last book that was designed with new GMs in mind published, and actually done well? I can think of Star Wars 2nd Edition Revised &amp; Expanded. That was really designed with new gamers in mind, and provided all the necessary hand holding. It was also 1996. I can't recall having read anything published since then that did as good a job, or even a particularly good job at introducing new gamers.
<blockquote>Some MMOs focus on boring fucking shit</blockquote>
I'm a bit undecided on that. I used to love doing boring shit in MUDs. Nowadays I can't stand to. I like to have the story moving along quickly. I can't help but notice that when I played MUDs I was in high school and now I'm finishing university. Time is a much more valuable commodity now than it was then. I think this could be chalked up to player preferences.
<blockquote>Shared Experience</blockquote>
I feel this used to exist with TSR publishing tons of copies of any module. There are certain iconic adventures that everyone can talk about. I can find a decent number of people who played Undermountain and discuss it with them. Nowadays the market is so fractured the odds of meeting another gamer who has played the same adventure as you is quite a bit lower.<br/><br/>One thing that RPGs will have a hard time dealing with is players splitting up. It's a huge problem in table top games, at least for me. I hate it when it happens. There's no way to make it work well. In MMOs it's not the slightest problem.                        </div>

Big draw. BIG draw! Imagine, you wake up at 3 AM and there's your gaming group at the table waiting for you to roll dice.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><b>MMOs are fucking visual as fuck</b></blockquote>
OK, yes. But if you had played longer Andy you would have noticed something interesting. I played a lot of DDO for about 8 months before I cancelled my account and the thing is, folks just run through all that cool scenery gunning down beasties and popping chests. If its your first time through, sure you're looking for where things are going to come at you and the rogue is searching for traps to keep your ass alive. But usually its find someone who knows the place and GO! It started to get so bad that I would go through a quest and know almost nothing about it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><b>MMOs are generally easy to get into</b></blockquote> Generally true. 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><b>Some MMOs focus on boring fucking shit</b></blockquote> DDO didn't have Crafting. But it did have running and gunning the same damn dungeon for the 50th time looking for phat loot to drop. Farming phat loot from easy runs with known exploits. It's weird, I was basically addicted to the game and most of it wasn't any fun. Folks even pay real dollars to get fake gold pieces from Chinese sweatshops to buy stuff from magic item stores rather than play the game to get the gold and items themselves. I kid you not. Paying money for a game and then paying more money not to have to play it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><b>Shared Experience</b></blockquote> This is a biggie. Its basically the reason I played so long. I met up with a bunch of folks and formed a guild. They were fun and they didn't rush through the quests quite so blatantly. The game wasn't keeping me very interested and when they left to play Lord of the Rings online Beta, I had not reason to be online. <br/><br/>Not sure where my rambling is leading.                        </div>

                            MMOs support multiple modes of engagement with the game - you can fight the monsters, fight each other, go exploring, craft things, hang around and chat with other players, etc.<br/>
<br/>
MMOs are (usually) large enough that you can avoid players that you do not want to play with.<br/>
<br/>
MMOs (often) allow you to play solo.<br/>
<br/>
Above all, in an MMO each player has a spotlight shining on their character all the time, if they want it. I think this is what enables a lot of the other MMO features and is the hardest thing to bring to the tabletop. In fact, it's an undesirable, and I think it's one of the reasons that tabletop RPGs can only learn so much from MMOs.                        </div>

This is why for my superheroes game, I gave the players a copy/access to the stand-alone City of Heroes character generator that was released in Korea (you can change a registry setting to get it to display in English).  And, as Andy himself once pointed out to me, there's HeroMachine and probably similar products.  So these cover characters, though nothing else (landscape, buildings, etc.).                        </div>

                            Another thing you have in MMOs is status as a real (and sometimes easily measurable) resource.  Why do people spend real money to get crap in the game instead of playing the game to get it?  Status.  It's the Lame-&gt;Lords progression that people were talking about in the other thread.  I can be cool now instead of being a schmuck for x levels...for a real dollar price.<br><br>I think the lesson for tabletop is that people will often take the easiest road to a reward even if it is detrimental to their fun.  One of the designers for City of Heroes once noted that if there was an MMO that gave you xp the fastest if you just did nothing but press the space bar for hours, 80% of the players would do only that and then complain that the game was boring...even if there was a ton of more fun stuff to do in the game.  <br><br>As a designer or GM, it is worthwhile to look at your game and see what you are rewarding and whether the behavoir that gets rewards also makes the game fun/better.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<b>MMOs utilize the downtime</b><br/><br/>I was discussing with Chris Chinn how MMOs still have mechanically active <i>stuff</i> happening to your character while you're not logged in. WoW has an EP bonus, EVE Online lets your skills power up (eliminating the common level-grind), and Dofus lets you regain a hard-to-obtain resource if you log off while your character is in special areas. This makes good business sense for MMOs as it keeps members hooked, but it also helps in games intended for long-term play over several sessions.<br/><br/>The key point is that it's not a reward for <i>not</i> playing, it's a reward for playing <i>again</i>. I think PTA does this in a story-game way through "Next Week On..." It gives you something to look forward to when you come back to the game.                        </div>

                            Looking at Andy's statements...<br/>
<br/>
<b>MMOs: You can play ANY TIME you are inclined: Someone's gonna be online.</b><br/>
This is actually a bigger issue I think as MMOs become an alternative for the busy professional thirty-something gamer who has a wife and kids and doesn't have a lot of freetime. Online gaming is just so much more convenient. However raiding with 39 other people, even on a Vent server, is nothing compared to the jokes and banter around a gaming table. As much as I hated the ads ran by WotC last year taking a none too subtle stab at WoW, they were right. Its better to be together even if it is a tad difficult. The payoff is that much better.<br/>
<br/>
<b>MMOs are fucking visual as fuck</b><br/>
I think this has a lot to do with consistency and ownership. Imagine a game where you are all playing Orcs? All WoW players will be able to spot an Orc or Tauren outpost a mile off because of the architecture (even that one as you enter Desolace that gets new players everytime...). So have the players define some of the visual aspects of the culture. Let them really get into it. Maybe have visual or textural reference - a piece of leather or some bark - so that you appeal to a number of senses. I'm not quite sure how you can capture the immense vistas of EVE Online with this method but you might be able to.<br/>
<br/>
<b>MMOs are generally easy to get into</b><br/>
I think a game that has an underlying single mechanic works well with this statement. Remember when (and I could be wrong here) D&amp;D 2nd Ed had one roll where you had to roll high on the d20 and another where you had to roll low? THACO and Saves I believe. Thats just silly. One unified mechanic allows for a quick and simple introduction to the game whilst slowly unfurling the new stuff. Note this doesn't necessarily say that the game cannot have complexity.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Some MMOs focus on boring fucking shit</b><br/>
MMOs are time sinks and generally there will be a mechanism to reward those with lots of time for being online. They also become increasingly about minute incremental gains in power. So sometimes you can convert time into power. However there is the other phemonenon - the crafter - the person who just gets off on it. I believe that this attracts people because it allows them to have a fuller 'character' within the world. They aren't just a warrior for the Horde, they are one of a few skilled blacksmiths that can craft the UBERSWORD OF DOOM! That in itself give fame on any server. Maybe it's those extra bits that your characters do in a larger face to face rpg? The deeper things that round out the character?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Shared Experience</b><br/>
I think that MMOs give players a common language to work with and a common frame of reference. I've done it in these answers, using examples that really only other WoW players would understand. I've got dozens of casual acquaintances that I can barely remember the second name of but we can have intense conversations about druid PvP strategies or the correct way to tank Ragnaros. RPG experiences rarely have that common ground - moreover when this happens we rarely care. How many times have you seen people being mocked for sharing stories of their character or their game? The silly thing is that those people have unique tales to tell, whereas the MMO player will have a very narrow range of experiences at their disposal. I'm not sure how we could deliver that commonality of language to RPGs and retain their hetrogenous nature.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a theory however, based on the experiences of my playgroup. We played 'traditional' rpgs for many years and then we played WoW a lot and then we turned to story games. Why? I believe that WoW does D&amp;D better than D&amp;D. It takes the essence of the wargame soul of D&amp;D and rips it out and upgrades it. If you take that stuff out of D&amp;D whats left? Character and story. Smaller, quicker games filled with character and story. Sound familiar?<br/>

<b>MMOs: You can play ANY TIME you are inclined: Someone's gonna be online.</b><br>This is one of my design goals with the Year We All Died. Because you play characters that are mostly communicating with each other through phone calls, emails, blogging, text messaging or other forms or remote communication you don't need to be sitting right next to someone else to lay the game. You can text out a message to your characters boy friend on the way home from work, write a letter to your characters brother who has gone off to war while you wait for classes to start, or respond to a post on another characters blog at 3 in the morning. The idea is to use non face-to-face communicatiion to create a shared world of phone calls, emails, diaries, blogs, forums and notes wher ethe characters can live as real people.<br><br><b>MMOs are fucking visual as fuck</b><br>yes. I'm a very, very visually oriented person (and an illustrator by trade), but I feel like both my games are visual failures. Even as artifacts they don't convey the visual information I want players to have. It's very, very rare for me to find a game book that I think does a good job of presenting the game and the world in a way that gives me a clear visual understanding of it. It's not all about pictures either. There's lots of well illistrated game books out there that don't do a good job of conveying what the game is about and what makes it fantastic and cool. When I play WoW I almost always stop and look at the scenery. I love that shit. I explore just so I can see cool stuff. I did the same with FF11 and other games I've played, all the way back to FF7 (which I think was the first game I played where I went out of my way just to look at pretty scenery).<br><br>This isn't so much an issue with a game like Panty Explosion. The visual description of a japanese high school is always going to be pretty dull. On the other hand, I think PE does a good job of keeping the worlds visual elements in mind by letting players choose and describe the visual elements of each scene. This keeps the players thinking about where they are and where they want to go next.  <br><br>One of the things I love about fantasy is breath taking scenery, alien vistas and unknown worlds. Amazing shit that I can't see outside my own home. When I play FF or WoW I'm playing as much to explore the world as to experience the story. If I'm making or playing a game with similar settings I want to be able to explore the visual aspects of those settings in an interesting and meaningful way. How do I do that?<br><br><b>MMOs are generally easy to get into</b><br>Right now I'm playing Brave Story on my PSP. In the first temple I went to I faced a challenge that taught me how to move around and interact with the world. Simple stuff. I left the temple and went to the forest, where I ran into my first part member. Togetehr we fought gimblewolves and she showed me how combat, health, Bravura skills and weapons worked. NOw I know how to fight! In the next town she introduced me to friends and family. I learned how towns are set up and where you go to buy different things, collect bounties, save and heal andget info. I also learned how the crafting system worked. Leaving that town we went to the river, where we met a man who showed us how to catch birds and make them fight each other.  <br><br>At each stop I learn a little more about the game, but I'm alos platying the game as I go. I get everything I need to play right away, but with each scene I learn a bit more. This seems like a really obvious way to teach a game, and I've wwondered why it isn't used more often (or evr) in TT rpgs. I mentioned this to a friend awhile back, and she said that she thought that this kind of stuff was the duty of the GM. It wasn't something that the game itself should have to worry about. I don't agree, but I haven't had a chance to use this in a design yet.<br><br><b>Some MMOs focus on boring fucking shit</b><br>I stopped playig Star Wars because it was a game about sewing. On the other hand, I really dig making stuff and gatehring craft shit in WoW, Monster Hunters and a few  other games. Making shit is cool if it's part of the game, but is boring if it's a tacked on extra aspect. Travis Brown and I have been working on a project called Gun Mage forever, where a central part of the game is choosing and building your magic bullets. This isn't something you do n the game. You don't sit around with friends and play out scenes of crafting bullets and choosing spells. It happens off screen. But it gives players a way to design an aspect of the game that is theirs and theirs alone. A bullet with their name on it. And when you load your gun, you're loading up the 5 bullets that you specially designed for whatever situation you're about to throw yourself into. What comes out of your gun will be different then what comes out of mine, and you can take pride in that design.<br><br><br><br><br>Jake                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote>I mean organisations like the Camarilla do lots of inbetween game stuff, run IRC chat where you can dip in anytime and tend to place an emphasis on costuming. </blockquote>
Neat. How my character (and other characters) look is very important to me. I usually express that by drawing at the table, but it would be cool if there were other ways. Costuming is so important! I used to get pissed off flipping through the DMG looking for cool loot and never finding just lists of cool clothes that maybe gave you small magical bonuses. And one of the things I love about Dogs, the thing that won me over more then anything else, was the importance placed on describing your coat. <br><br/>Anyway, I want to be able to dress my character up! Matt and I are working on a fighting game that uses paper dolls and multiple outfits, but I want to see costuming in other games as well!                        </br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>OK, yes. But if you had played longer Andy you would have noticed something interesting. I played a lot of DDO for about 8 months before I cancelled my account and the thing is, folks just run through all that cool scenery gunning down beasties and popping chests. If its your first time through, sure you're looking for where things are going to come at you and the rogue is searching for traps to keep your ass alive. But usually its find someone who knows the place and GO! It started to get so bad that I would go through a quest and know almost nothing about it.<br/></blockquote>
That depends, some games can just be so pretty that you never tire of looking at them, or hearing them. I used to leave the original Myst running in the background on my computer so that I could see the forests and listen to the music as I worked ... and from time to time I would switch to it and just wander around. This was after I had completed it, I was just doing it because it looked so good!                        </div>

                            Two ones that are already kinda "duh" around here, but are exemplified well by anecdotes in MMORPG design:<br/><br/><br/><b>People will ask for crap mechanics they're familiar with; don't listen to them</b><br/><br/>Not mechanics they like. Just mechanics they're used to. Resting and overlong recharge times used to be standard in every fantasy-themed MMOG. When the new wave of games rolled out, people actively bitched about not having those elements in games, even though most of them found the actual mechanics really boring. Then they played them for a while and stopped wanting those things.<br/><br/><br/><b>Follow the resources</b><br/><br/>Take a careful look at the resources and currency in your game. Whatever is an effective way to get them is what a lot of folks will be doing. For example, if the best way to get rich or high-level in an MMOG is to do something mind-numbingly repetitive, people will do it and then tell you your game sucks because it's mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you gave them the option of doing something else less boring that would earn them a smaller reward. Similarly, if the most efficient way to get treasure in an MMOG is to grief other players (this is a popular trick in games that permit PvP and make you drop your loot when killed -- players can get hours' worth of farmed-up loot out of a single fight), that'll happen a ton, too. (Story-game example: I think most of the coolest TSOY Keys are the ones where going for the big 5-point reward or the buy-off results in cool dramatic stuff -- heck, <i>all</i> of them were basically designed with that goal in mind.)<br/><br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>

This one is so true it needs to be carved on mountain faces. MMORPGs are a testament to the terrifying power of behavioural conditioning. Most of them are <i>nakedly </i>Pavlovian.                        </div>

This one is also true. How many of us have been asked why our games don't have combat systems or hit points? How many of our games have needless artifacts from game sthat influenced us?                        </div>

                            I think the various ones about how people love personalized characters (e.g. the dress-up stuff above) are very important. Being able to give your toon a cool face or shiny armor (especially if the player can mix and match pieces) is a very popular feature in modern fantasy MMOGs. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowclan" rel="nofollow">Shadowclan orcs</a> in Ultima Online are a great example of what kinds of things people will do with this.<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>
