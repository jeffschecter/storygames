I'd love to hear peoples' thoughts on my upcoming kickstarter for playing superheroes in the Apocalypse World. There's a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18364/worlds-in-peril-supers-dungeon-world-hack#Item_28" rel="nofollow">previous thread on it over here</a>, if you're interested to see what it started out as. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/63676387/104094314?token=aa33a0ee" rel="nofollow">The preview for the kickstarter is here</a>! I'd love any and all feedback, critiques, etc. Especially since a whole bunch of people have been doing kickstarters on here recently. Any questions of course, feel free! I'm on Korean time so I might be a bit late responding depending on time but I definitely will, of course!

I'm hoping to have it ready to go for the kickstarter but we'll see how much work needs to be done on it.<br/><br/>-The bust wouldn't be color, no, though the cover would. I should probably go in and clarify that, yeah.<br/>-I'm pretty hesitant for changing up art stuff since it could slow down stuff and art is already going to take a long while.<br/>-We were thinking of doing a game thing as well but schedule wise it's usually difficult since I'm in Korea and just busy in general.

What do you think of the amount of information up front? I'm still working on the talking head video which will have more info than the teaser of course, and far less time than the playtest video but does the page itself have too little in terms of system stuff or anything?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429817/#Comment_429817" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T09:38:20+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  9:38AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you need more "above the fold." I'd like to get a little more information before we get to the big Introduction banner. The pitch focuses a lot on what Apocalypse World is, but not very much about what makes Worlds in Peril special. I'd like to see a two to three sentence pitch that focuses on your game, rather than AW. <br/><br/>Maybe -<br/><br/>"Comic book stories and characters like you've always wanted them! Worlds in peril combines descriptive and flexible powers with a structure that encourages players to take control of their stories. Powered by the Apocalypse World system, Worlds in Peril can produce compelling super hero action in any world." <br/><br/>Or something like that. As it is it reads a little more like a design blog than a kickstarter. I like the meat of it, but I'd like you to tell me something about the game itself. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429839/#Comment_429839" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T12:46:17+00:00" title="March 24, 2014 12:46PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What <a href="/forums/profile/FOVBen">@FOVBen</a> says. Images are big and the text is long and compact. For instance, 'the team', you could use bullets points with roles and links. <i>For the images and texts, you could integrate them altogether in an image (even the text in the KS page would be in the image). It has no real impact on 'keyword', but it is a lot of work, in my opinion.</i><br/><br/>Something I think you should really, but really add (and note that you not have done it either for Magician, which is very good page BTW): <b>present me the rewards and the pledge levels</b>. <br/>I went thru all this beautifully illustrated page to have to move up and read the rewards in that awful layout. And you have a lot of tiers.<br/><br/>Represent the rewards with icons and put them in the center of the page. For instance, as I read it 'Home Grown Hero' is limited to people living in Korea? If so, put a 'label' with the information on it.<br/><br/>I would put a production planning too. And add that information on the reward level ('early access' means a certain date). <br/><br/>Otherwise, you are all set. Quite an impressive work.<br/><br/><i>A little note: I have a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/671321082/1879808645?token=d8e09677" rel="nofollow">KS</a> starting this Friday and I'm doing something a little bit like you (PDF only) and I think it could serve you as an example.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429884/#Comment_429884" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T19:09:16+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  7:09PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, this is all great feedback!

It did nothing to sell the product. Gave me vague promises that pretty much every rpg ever promises. Provided no details.<br/><br/>Would love to see a video that super-briefly encapsulates the main points on the page. The best KS videos are where the creator him- or herself gets on and discusses the game in straightforward, coherent terms.

For instance, at 25$ I could have stickers, t-shirt, mugs, posters? <br/>- If I want to include them (let's say posters or T-shirts), I'll have to include them in my budget (and I'm not even talking about shipping), thus increasing my initial goal for something that is not relevant to the project, and has weak value to the backers. Who's going to buy that 25$ posters anyway?<br/>- The main reason KickStarter projects deliver late and off budget is the delivery of physical rewards.
