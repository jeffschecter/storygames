My girlfriend, who is supposed to co-GM the game with me, has convinced me we should set it on an actual spaceship rather than a sailboat, to make it feel more like the show. We're still using 5E, but now with some Spelljammer stuff added in. This change in direction has also helped me settle on a title!<br/><br/>So I am going to need the "island" generator to be slightly tweaked to be more of a "planet/planetoid" generator. But otherwise all the same stuff.<br/><br/>The game will focus on the tension engendered by resource scarcity + largely untrained, civilian crew. The point of the randomly generated islands is for the PCs to go on them and get what they need, if they can, in terms of food and other supplies. Meanwhile, the ship is not under their control. It seems to have a will or even a mind of its own. They can work to unlock its secrets by doing Parsely-style investigating. That's probably going to be the toughest design work we have ahead of us.<br/><br/>Also: we're planning on recruiting 12 or so players, and allowing up to 8 to come to each session. 4 can go planet-side, the other 4 can stay on the ship and deal with the crew and/or work on solving the puzzles.<br/><br/>So, what do you think, S-G community? Does this sound fun? What potential pitfalls do you see?<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438834/#Comment_438834" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-29T21:43:21+00:00" title="September 29, 2014  9:43PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's exciting, Matt.<br/><br/>Tell me more about "the other 4 can stay on the ship and deal with the crew and/or work on solving the puzzles".

And yes, the internal problems of the ship will be one "front" of the game.<br/><br/>The large pool of players thing is a way of dealing with the realities of adult schedules. It also models the way many ensemble TV shows work fairly well, with some people only appearing in the background in certain weeks. Advanced Wizards and Wizards works that way too\u2014I have about 10 players, but only 4 or at most 5 come to any given session. It seems to work just fine. Obviously it creates pressure to complete a concrete objective/plot each session, but that's a good thing IMO. Also, following the model of the SGU TV show, there's an at least reasonably good in-fiction reason why the away team has a very finite amount of time to complete its mission: the ship is leaving, with or without them, in a set amount of time (i.e. at the end of session).<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438852/#Comment_438852" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-30T12:32:05+00:00" title="September 30, 2014 12:32PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

Each game, such as Action Castle, comes on a glossy, folded card with each room described for the GM and a list of exits, objects, and a few notes for adjudicating actions in the room.
