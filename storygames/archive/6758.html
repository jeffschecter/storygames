It may be more interesting to those who have played at least a little 3.X D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The post made me think about those times I had fun creating D&amp;D characters in 3.X, imagining their potential as they leveled.  Good lonely fun.  But for me, the fun character building rarely translated into fun play once I sat down at the table and engaged in what was presumably D&amp;D's strong point - combat.

Maybe in the future I'll be able to crank out a character in 10 minutes or less.  But even at the starting level, I'm like "Tactical Warlord or Inspiring Warlord?" Then I spent about 10 minutes dawdling over those paths to decide which 1st level abilities to play. I settled on a charismatic warlord (even though I'm usually all about the whopping of damage: I really want to try out the skin of "you aren't so badass, but you help your friends be total badasses"). Anyway, after that I spent about 8 more minutes deciding what ability scores I should take, and where: "Do I go for that one 18 in cha? Do I then go for Str, or Int (because of the int-based modifier bonuses for the tactical warlord). <br/><br/>The only pieces I almost flew through were Feats and Skills, which were ALWAYS my most belaboured decisions in 3e. I picked my trained skills in less than 30 secs (by the names alone; then I looked up what they do, and decided that's what I actually wanted anyway), and my feats in under 2 minutes or so.  Since there's no chain-style feat progression At All (must take these three feats first, then you can take that badass feat right at level 12 instead of waiting for level 18, etc), it was relatively easy to find what I wanted.<br/><br/>So yeah, on one hand, I can't go "I want to make Elric by making a fighter/sorcerer, and that really differentiates my character from the fighter, or the sorcerer" (actually, in most of the games I played, at all levels, most people I played with ended up sticking through one class anyway, it made sense for power purposes, especially with prestige classes and the like). Yet there are still 2-3 different "paths" for heroes at the lower levels (Warlord: Tactical or Charismatic. Warlock: Fey, Infernal, etc), then more differentiation at the Paragon levels. <br/><br/>Anyway, my warlord is a female unaligned temptress named "Nameless" (she has amnesia). She joined the party because another saved her life, and her word is bond. So now she helps lead the party, and in the process plans on living a hedonistic (Conan-style) life while trying to reclaim her past.  I bet that's gonna be different than the warlord made up by the guy at another table, whose warlord is gonna look different than the warlock at the table of yet another.  Character differentiation is still there, the real differentiation - How that person talks, acts, and what their goals are - you just have to supply it yourself. :-)<br/><br/>That's my take on it at this point, anyway. Only played 3 sessions total thus far, tho.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150302/#Comment_150302" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T21:28:22+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:28PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, there are a few places where there's still chain-style feat progression, most notably in armor training, as I found out when trying to armor up my dwarven starlight warlock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150326/#Comment_150326" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T00:53:59+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:53AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno. It seems like the argument is that "There are lots of play options, as opposed to character options, and that's what makes it fun." <br/><br/>That may be true when comparing 4e to 3e, but then I just think hey, BECMI D&amp;D or even OD&amp;D are that philosophy taken to the max. You had very few character options, but the play options were basically infinite - whatever the hell you wanted to do. There were <i>no</i> constraints in the form of skills and feats and the like which delineated what your character could and couldn't do. <br/><br/>So why bother with 4e? Maybe it is more fun than 3e, but that's like saying watching paint dry is more fun than being flogged with a knotted rope. I have my Rules Cyclopedia and my 2e books, so I think I'll just play them and give 4e a miss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tork" title="tork"><img alt="tork" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tork">tork</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150348/#Comment_150348" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T04:12:47+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  4:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand your point, but there's a big difference in feel between a game with minimal rules that leaves all options available through GM adjudication, and a game with complex rules that mechanically supports a wide variety of tactical options.
