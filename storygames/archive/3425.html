The initial conflict is over if the players' numbers (7 or 11) are hit, or the Authority's are (2, 3, or 12). I have this bit about the odds of the conflict being done on the first roll, or its having to follow-on. Let me know if I'm wrong about this please.\n<blockquote><cite>Misspent Youth draft rules text</cite>In the Throwdown, the Youthful Offenders' odds are much better than those of The Authority. On the Throwdown, The Authority will win only about 12% of the time, but the Youthful Offenders will win almost 26% of the time. This also means that conflicts will end in the Throwdown almost 40% of the time.<br/><br/>Of course, another way of putting this is that you will not resolve a conflict at this stage over 60% of the time. When this happens, you move to the Tussle.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77291/#Comment_77291" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-23T21:16:08+00:00" title="June 23, 2007  9:16PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick calculation here gives:<br/><br/>P (7 or 11) = 8/36 = 22%<br/>P (2, 3, 12) = 4/36 = 11%                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77292/#Comment_77292" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-23T21:19:36+00:00" title="June 23, 2007  9:19PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

The post odds are correct. I've got a larger question. As I understand it, your resolution mechanic follows the primary craps bet (i.e., the Pass line) pretty closely. Once you get to the Tussle, the YO needs to make their point before they crap out. Using just these two methods, the odds favor the Authority/House (which is why the casinos use it, natch). Are you planning on using that as is, i.e. over all success is less likely than not? Or are there some wrinkles I haven't seen yet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77307/#Comment_77307" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T05:49:35+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  5:49AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conflicts end in the throwdown a third of the time.

When this happens, when you get a "no one wins" result, you move to the Tussle.</blockquote>\nJustin:<br/><br/>As a non-avid (not at all, as a matter of fact) craps player I am not entirely sure I understand your question, but let me answer what I think you're asking.<br/><br/>Once you get to the Tussle, The YOs own the point (which I'm calling the Target) and the Authority owns 7 <i>and</i> two numbers based on the level of NPC it's using, (2 and 3 for Unnamed, up to 6 and 8 for the Big Bad). At this point the YOs win on their point and lose on The Authority's.<br/><br/>Some YO chooses to Stand Up, rolls, and if they hit any other number besides a winning number, they pick a Trait to use, claim that number as a win condition and narrate a potential win (e.g., "I throw the knife at your heart," rather than, "I stick the knife in your heart"). If The Authority doesn't push (add a victory point to the pot, then narrate a similar likely win), the YOs win. Otherwise they claim that number, then someone else has to choose to Stand Up.<br/><br/>If the YOs hit an Authority number they lose, period. However, The Authority may choose to Tempt them and offer to give them a win for the conflict if they flip one of their Traits to a Sold version. The Authority may then use a Sold Trait once per player per Operation to steal away a certain victory and force the YOs to roll on what would ordinarily have been a win for them.<br/><br/>At end of conflict, the Victory Points either go to The Authority as Authority Points to spend to narrate in facts about the world, or as Cool points that are claimed or distributed by players, which are then used to establish facts. The Operation is won by who has more established facts.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>So a long-winded way of answering: Yes, the odds favor The Authority in a Tussle in the short term, but not in the long term, unless it's got Sold traits to call on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77363/#Comment_77363" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T14:58:01+00:00" title="June 24, 2007  2:58PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In case you're curious, the playmat, which has most of the rules for conflict resolution, can be found at <a href="http://splitparty.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/misspent-youth-playmat/" rel="nofollow">Splitting the Party</a>, the design-in-public collective that came out of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3371" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
