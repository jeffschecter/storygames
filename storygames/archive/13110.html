Why the title "A taste for murder"?<br/><br/>The title changed lots of times! Originally, it was "A Reason To Murder", but I wondered whether it was too low key. So it became "A Need To Kill", but that sounded like a film noir.<br/>Then I thought I'd make it sound like a dinner party game. So it became A Taste For Murder. It was going to have pictures of wine glasses and stuff on the front. And then it didn't, but the title stuck.<br/><br/>- Speaking of film noir. The setting \u2014 English countryside, circa 1930 \u2014 is typical of classical mystery novels \xe0 la Agatha Christie. On the other side, the very dark tone of the stories created by the game seems to go more towards the noir genre. Do you agree?<br/><br/>Yes. It uses murder mysteries as a framework, but can go much darker than most Agatha Christie novels.<br/>That said, if you read, for example, P. D. James' murder mysteries, they can be very dark.<br/><br/>- Apart from P.D. James, which literary authors had the strongest influence on you? (I understand the list can be long).<br/><br/>For A Taste For Murder? It's mainly Agatha Christie, with a touch of Margery Allingham.<br/>Really, though, it's based on the BBC adaptations of Agatha Christie's work. I grew up with Joan Hickson as Miss Marple.<br/><br/>- I particularly appreciated the "sourcebook" on British life. Very... well, very British indeed (at least, based on stereotypes from outside the UK). Have you described the matter-of-fact truth about your country, or deformed it through the lens of fiction?<br/><br/>I've deformed it!<br/>Well, partly. Whenever you write thing, you take a view of it. So this is British life through the lens of murder mysteries. For example, that thing about the gentleman saying good morning to the shopkeeper? There's a lot of truth in it, but I've taken a particularly middle-class view. Similarly, I'm talking about England from the points of view of the middle-classes (the readership of murder mysteries) and the established rich (the characters in the fiction). There's little mention of the Depression, for example, or the Bright Young Things, who tore up London with drug-fuelled parties. So I've taken a particular point of view. That said, I think it's an accurate point of view. If there are stereotypes in it, they are stereotypes British people would recognise. And I like that.<br/><br/>- So it's true there should be a lot of speaking about the weather so much that you have compiled even a random table about it?<br/><br/>Well...<br/>Here is how the weather in Britain works. It doesn't, as the stereotypes have it, rain all the time (unless you're in Cardiff). But it's immensely changeable. One moment it rains, the next it doesn't. If it's sunny, it's somewhat of a surprise.<br/>So the weather affects British life a great deal. For example, if you're planning to hang the washing out to dry, you must know whether it will rain. If you're planning on riding a horse, you want to know whether you'll get wet. If you're having a garden party, you pray for good weather.<br/>And so British people talk about the weather. But not all the time. Most importantly for the game, though, activities are planned around the weather. <br/>So that's how the game works. You choose the weather, then choose an activity to suit. Because that's how it works in Britain. You look at the weather, then think: it's sunny, we should go for a walk.<br/><br/>- Another game mechanic that I liked is the white&amp;black dice, given as a bonus roll if you show some particular disruptive emotion in your acting. Is it an original component of your design or is taken from somewhere else?<br/><br/>It's stolen from My Life With Master. In that game, you get bonus dice for things like sincerity.<br/>But the Black and White dice are actually about status. They encourage you to take high and low status: for example, they encourage you to let blood or be subservient. They push you to extremes. They steer you towards emotional and comic situations. They're the comedy mechanic.<br/><br/>- Speaking about status: I remember this technique comes from impro theatre (and of course you've written "Play Unsafe", an essay on impro &amp; roleplaying). Do you think that to play "A Taste for Murder" there's the need to be an impro actor?<br/><br/>No, not really. The Black and White Dice should push you to do the status things, even if you don't really know what status is.<br/>That said, it does require a willingness to try and improvise. Like other games, such as Fiasco, there's a freeform element to A Taste For Murder.<br/><br/>- And how much impro theatre affected *you* in writing the game?<br/><br/>Not much! Apart from the thing about Black and White dice again.<br/><br/>- The cover is nicely similar to that of the Penguin Crime editions. Are you planning a series (e.g. supplements, expansions on other crime subgenres...)?<br/><br/>What a wonderful question. Firstly, let me mention how happy I am with Narrativa's Italian cover. My original cover echoed the Penguin Crime covers. They've chosen to echo the Italian equivalent, the Libri Gialli yellow books. It's perfect.<br/>As for a series: I've thought of doing some parallel games. Originally, A Taste For Murder had a strapline: "A Inspector Chapel Mystery", and I planned to do other Inspector Chapel mysteries. We'll see if that happens. Having written A Taste For Murder, I'm aware that there are other ways to do a murder mystery: for example, you could concentrate on clues, rather than relationships. That might be interesting. But we'll see. I have other stuff to do, too!<br/><br/>- Other stuff like...?<br/><br/>I always have Cthulhu scenarios to write. The last of my Purist series, The Rending Box, needs writing up. Then there's the huge postapocalyptic campaign, Cthulhu Apocalypse. The first three scenarios have been playtested and will be published soon: we're working with Alessandro Alaia, who's doing some beautiful art. There are nine more scenarios after that. There are also things I'll publish myself. So, there will be a book on Cthulhu storytelling, tentatively titled The Lazy Keeper's Guide. There's a potential sequel to Play Unsafe. Perhaps other stuff, too. I keep thinking of new things.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295540/#Comment_295540" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T09:56:53+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  9:56AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was fun to do.
