Especially if you come to either the DC area or the Triangle in North Carolina.

With the others, having an event at a game store or with a game club would be a great way to do it (introduce new games and ways of playing, meet new people, have a good time, et cetera). Getting non-gamers to show up at an event of gamers at a gamery place might be a little more difficult, but I think would be totally worthwhile if we can figure out a way to do more than just "oh you brought your girlfriend/little brother/mom/fellow you met at the bar last night, let's play!"

The Central Library in downtown Portland has hip events and shit all the time, but they're usually Q&amp;A sessions with a cool VIP lecturer. We could break that pattern and rock their socks!<br/><br/>We could have like three tables for different age groups , so like Gun Thief at Adult, Dreaming Crucible at Young Adult, and Wildlings at Children. (I think it's especially important at a library to keep Gun Thief's target age clear.) Man, that makes me want to work on my game idea for a Sonic The Hedgehog-style adventure game!<br/><br/>It's too bad you're traveling in Winter, 'cuz Story Games at the Park would be grand. I cool big-circle storyjam with rules like Archipelago or whatnot would be wonderful in that setting!<br/><br/>My big goal in such an endeavor would be that people of all ages would go away from the experience with the ability and drive to DO THIS THEMSELVES, not just "man, that was cool when those storygaming rockstars swept through and helped us tell stories in a way that we can never possibly duplicate because we're not rockstars." This means both materials to help them (sell microgames, give handouts) AND teaching techniques they can internalize and apply on their own.<br/><br/>Also, by "travel North America exploring" you really mean "hang out in Portland for a month or so, and put in token appearances at other cities," right?

For example, if you were trying to craft an experience for a book club you could figure out how to set up your post-game discussion to mirror the way they normally discuss stories they've read. You'd also probably want games with hooks that they can understand in their terms, such as recognizable literary genres rather than genres that only make sense to gamers like the traditional "adventuring party" setup. Also, I think there's a strong tendency in the story games community to focus on visual media like film and television when we talk about and play games, so you may want to analyze the way you describe and explain story games to see if there are ways to make them more resonant when you deal with more literary venues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278066/#Comment_278066" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T13:36:59+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  1:36PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>I think you should definitely start a blog, with a nicely-designed website that you can update from the road.

Maybe you could identify local groups that do kinda-similar creative stuff -- improv clubs, writers' clubs, etc -- and piggyback on their infrastructure and membership.<br/><br/>Also, consider the example of the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/asuwxpcl/" rel="nofollow">UW Experimental College</a>, which offers lots of hobby-introduction courses.  I learned how to kayak and how to play soccer there.  These courses are typically offered by a for-profit business looking for low-friction way to acquire new customers in bulk, so I believe it's entirely honorable for you to have Ribbon Drive fliers there.<br/><br/>As far as the actual event itself... this is probably just my nerd social damage talking, but learning to kayak in that Experimental College environment was really positive for me.  It was nice to be part of a big gaggle of newbies that was constantly asking stupid questions and screwing up instructions.  Contrast that with my experience at some dojos or yoga studios, where I've been tossed into the deep end with people of all experience levels and I wasn't sure where to fit in or how to behave or whatever.  Being the only student in a roomful of prospective teachers sucked.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I wonder if you should consider not inviting anyone with a story-games account to participate in actual play at one of these events.  If I were a prospective participant, I wouldn't want to feel like I was blundering into a  pre-existing social club freighted with opaque and arcane conventions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279969/#Comment_279969" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T09:11:48+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  9:11AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I can quite manage being lovely, but a place to sleep and shower, and a well-stocked kitchen, are definitely things I can provide, should you find yourself in Boston.  Of course, there's already a fairly healthy story-games community here, so this might be bringing coals to Newcastle.<br/><br/>And johnzo: I think there's a happy balance somewhere in there between inviting no current story-gamers and inviting too many current story-gamers.  I've done story-game advocacy at trad cons, and it *really* helps if you have one or two people at the table who know the opaque and arcane conventions and are happy to demonstrate and explain and assist.  The difference, I think, is in saying "Joe here has experience with the game, and is going to help me show how it's played," instead of just throwing the newbie in to sink or swim.<br/><br/>(One of the things I regret about the most recent JiffyCon:  I was facilitating Remember Tomorrow, and two of the players at the table had minimal to no experience with story games.  They were basically trad gamers who had heard there was a small con in Somerville and had come to check it out.  Had I realized that, I probably would have explained some of the conventions we were playing under.  Fortunately, they both picked up on what was going on very quickly; unfortunately, that meant I only found out after the fact; fortunately, I do not seem to have destroyed two proto-story-gamers, so all's well that ends well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279976/#Comment_279976" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T10:41:16+00:00" title="July 10, 2010 10:41AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a million Meetup groups that have to do with gaming and game-related activities.
