It made me think of a freeform game I played once about homosexual tiger gods that I never want to play again...<br/><br/>But what the hell, right?  I don't have to use them.  In fact, I played a Maestro D', whose special doesn't require sex.<br/><br/>But then, in play, an NPC has my armor (+1 leather pants) and I want to get it back - and the Seduce move can totally do it for me - and I just go for it.  And, hey, it's not so bad, we take it off camera, and now the story's in a more interesting place!<br/><br/>From "Play Unsafe" this is one of my Unsafe areas - so, according to "Play Unsafe", I should go there.  And AW makes it easy, giving us game mechanical incentives.  It's like, "I'm not a pervert, I just want game resources, yo."  <br/><br/>And now that I've broken that ground I can do love relationships in In a Wicked Age (or the Venetian Tragedy, last weekend) and stay with it, do what the story wants rather than retreat to my comfort zone.<br/><br/>How do others feel about the sex moves / Seduce move?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312076/#Comment_312076" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T12:22:32+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 12:22PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2011 12:22PM by JDCorley.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always found more effective than just fading to black is putting some concrete detail about the sex in:<br/><br/>"And you have sex.

We found that the mechanics have the effect of distancing the players from the intimacy of characters having sex, which is a prominent component of *most* adult fiction. The very first time two of my players decided to go down that road there were lots of eye-rolls and nervous laughs, and then we got into the mechanics of it, and then it was totally dandy."</blockquote>\nNot my experience. We played six sessions and, I think, had an unfortunate wall of buzzkill sex moves (Battlebabe/Driver/Hardholder/Brainer). Mostly it was the tactical jumping of NPC bones when it happened at all, which was rarely. The only interesting thing to emerge from engaging with the sex move mechanism was when the Brainer killed a guy during the act by mistake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312098/#Comment_312098" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T14:10:12+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  2:10PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2011 3:30PM by ccreitz.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I gotta say, in our session the threat of the Brainer sex move was a killer app. No sane, sober person was going to take her up on the offer, right? So she engineered a situtation with crazy substance abusers, fun for all. <br/><br/>And also, isn't the Hardholder sex move the opposite of a buzzkill? You knock boots, and <i>stuff falls out</i>. ("Egads! Look what I found in my boot - an oddment worth 1-barter!") How is that not cool? We didn't have a hardholder, but I considered playing one, just for the special.<br/><br/>The Driver's sex move is crouching tiger hidden awesome, because it pushes you to make another guy. I sense that breaking up role monogamy was a major part of Vince's agenda, given the mechanical support he provides all over the game.<br/><br/>But yeah, I've heard the discussions defending the Battlebabe's sex move and remain unconvinced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312100/#Comment_312100" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T14:51:29+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  2:51PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, this game is probably not for you.*<br/><br/>(That really is kind of a bummer set of sex moves.

If the sex isn't part of the narration then it didn't get mentioned. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, its a move, and the players wanted to 'try out' moves, but in the end they didn't have to, unless they wanted the prescriptive and descriptive reward of the move - their characters just had sex / went to the dunny / ate food / played games  in the background and we didn't mention it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we did narrate the sex move, I modeled Jared's rule of three with my (unnamed) MC moves. The player's caught on. Thus just enough description was hinted to spark the imagination without it being so graphic that the assembled players left the room blushing. I mean, folks are usually quite happy to describe emotional abuse, arterial bleeds and dismembered heads with aplomb. Sex isn't all that icky is it? Heck, its meant to be fun, or at least funny and enjoyable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, our sex moves became: 'Bullet takes her roughly, yet with joy and abandon.' or 'Nicotine is a lazy screw, she works her paramour in sinuous delight.' or most recently; 'He's a fumble, all thumbs and forgotten contraceptives. His hazy recollection after is of a most mouth-watering kiss'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312108/#Comment_312108" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T15:36:18+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  3:36PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin, there was a little more to it, actually - the Driver was the Hardholder's brother (not going there, ironically) and the Brainer was a frostbitten faceless horror and an evil dick. The Battlebabe cancels out the Hardholder gift explosion, so the only PC he'd consider getting busy with provides no benefit either way. When a game mechanically rewards sex, no reward = no sex.

If he were a sexy guy, giving gifts to his lovers would be just part of it, natural as the rest. But he's not a sexy guy, nobody's into him for himself, so it'd have implications he doesn't want to deal with. If it weren't for his sex move, he'd probably have a sex life.<br/><br/>He'd consider getting with a battlebabe, because he'd know she'd mean it. If she wanted to, that is. Anyway there's not one around.<br/><br/>(The purpose of the sex moves isn't to reward the characters for having sex. As designer, and also just as me personally, I don't care if there's sex in your game or not.)<br/><br/>(In the source material, the battlebabe is almost always inaccessible, sexy but not anyone's lover. Either too innocent to treat casually, some kind of virgin warrior priestess, or else too dangerous and aloof to approach, flirt with her and she shoots you down. Firefly provides a cool, interesting exception, but there she's committed to the driver, which makes me grin.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312113/#Comment_312113" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T16:05:39+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  4:05PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2011 4:06PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason: That's really interesting!

I had a sense of what the sex was like, and wanted to share that in a non-pornographic way, but didn't have a vocabulary fr it. So Vincent after waitig a minute just moved on to "so, afterwards..." and that was ok, but I was a bit disappointed that I didn't get to share some detail (<i>emotional</i> detail, not sexy detail <i>as such</i>) with the group.<br/><br/>Something like JD's technique would've helped a lot.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312279/#Comment_312279" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-11T22:20:54+00:00" title="February 11, 2011 10:20PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>Reminds me of<i>In a Wicked Age</i>'s "Add one detail,"</blockquote>\nI remember it as "three concrete details", but don't have the book at hand.
