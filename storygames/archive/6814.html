The latter should not be confused with Judge Dredd / 2000 AD comic artist Henry Flint, who is much more British.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/wormwood.jpg"/><br/><br/>SUMMARY: Pseudo-Catholic church of Templar and Hospitaller Knights fight the demon infection of their living planet!  Warriors bond with symbiotes to becoming closer to the planet and gain weird powers!  Wormspeakers with their tongues replaced by dozens of slithering symbiote creatures!  Priests who use prayers to shape the planet around them!  Evil demon cultists!<br/><br/>Misfit Studios' Steven Trustrum is a big Wormwood dork too.  He even has <a href="http://www.trustrum.com/Palladium/Wormwood/pww-index.html" rel="nofollow">a webpage where he's added a bunch of supplemental stuff</a>.  For example, the art in the book clearly shows that there are evil, non-demonic warriors who serve the Unholy (demon lord of the setting), so he created <a href="http://www.trustrum.com/Palladium/Wormwood/pww-KnDH.html" rel="nofollow">a class for them</a>.<br/><br/>From the other thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>...the best class was definitely the Apok, which was a divine champion of Wormwood, the living planet.  Apok were former criminals redeemed by Wormwood, who gained their powers largely from the symbiotic mask that attached directly to their face, which made them as strong and durable as a tank, though they still fought with hand-to-hand weapons like swords.  They're basically symbiotic ex-con samurai with medieval Catholic crusader color, serving the planet they live on and depend on for their every need.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: First Oni</cite>I must agree. Those guys freakin' rocked!</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Whispered By: Jonathan Walton to Jason Morningstar</cite>There are also ancient giant symbiotic mecha, who've had cathedrals built around them over the course of their hundred-year slumber... until the day in which they are awakened to fight giant demonic evil creatures.  Awakening a Battle Saint is like the ultimate quest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Wormwood is far too cool for RIFTS. I am paging through my copy right now, dreaming dreams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim Boser</cite>My favorite race from Wormwood are the Holy Terrors. There's something about a walking talking suit of armor that stands out as being cool in my mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Sweet, we should start an I <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> Wormwood Society.  We can file the serial numbers off, make a 20-page micro-game of it, and hire &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.ttruman.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ttruman.com/</a>"&gt;Tim Truman or <a href="http://www.escapecomics.com/acatalog/Man-Bat.html" rel="nofollow">Henry Flint</a> (the original creators) to do the cover.<br/><br/>P.S. Only slightly joking.</blockquote>\nHow can we rescue the awesome that is Wormwood from the debacle that is its current mechanics, which haven't even been updated with errata since the first printing in 1993?  Also, what's your favorite parts?  What's worth salvaging for something else?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151744/#Comment_151744" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T18:36:22+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  6:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been years since I read the book, but I do have lovely, twisted, grungy visions of the work dancing around in my head.  The setting was so beautiful and strange, I honestly do think that had it been paired with a system that better mirrored the world we would have a deep and large Wormwood community on our hands.  <br/><br/>I really wouldn't know where to start.  The setting is so evocative that I wouldn't really want to leave any part of it out.  Perhaps it would be best to discuss the kinds of games we would like to play in the setting and go from there.  As for me, the Apok were always my favourite part, holy soldiers with terrible creatures grafted onto their faces.  I would love to run a campaign of these terrible knights questing against the evils in the world.  There's soooo much grist for the mill there.  <br/><br/>Also, contacting Mr. Truman shouldn't be that hard I would think.  From what I understand he's a very accommodating gentleman and keeps a good rapport with his fan base.  I wonder if he still holds the copyright and trademark information for the setting, as he was the creator of it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151749/#Comment_151749" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T19:05:04+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  7:05PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2008 7:06PM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sense I have is that all the rights are Palladium's, such that they don't renew the license or even necessarily pay royalties to Truman/Henry.  That tends to be Palladium's standard practice, but they have done things differently for TMNT and Robotech, for example.  Still, I doubt, even if they do still have some rights, that Truman/Henry would break a long-standing agreement with Kevin Siembedia to give the rights to a bunch of upstarts like us.  Honestly, I think it would be better to call this a "fan" project "inspired by Wormwood" rather than hewing too closely to the original.<br/><br/>The parts of Wormwood that I didn't like were always the parts that worked it into the wider universe of Rifts.  For example, all the dimensional gateways to other worlds.  The horror of the war against The Unholy becomes so much less horrifying if you can just go someplace else.  And while the visitors to Wormwood who were clearly written into the setting, like the Holy Terrors, were very cool, that doesn't mean they couldn't be native to Wormwood or part of the demonic infection that converted to the side of good.  Maybe they could even have arrived on a meteor crashed into the planet. I would rather play within a closed sandbox, since the Wormwood sandbox is already enormous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151753/#Comment_151753" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T19:40:56+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  7:40PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2008 7:58PM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I was just realizing that my love of Wormwood partially explains why I liked Feder &amp; Schwert's post-apocalyptic-children/angels-fighting-insect/demons-for-the-Mother-Church game, Engel (<a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9209.phtml" rel="nofollow">Brand's RPGnet review is here</a>).

I also felt like, while cool in theory, the Arcana system seemed half-developed or maybe just stripped down in its English version.  There were very few concrete guidelines about how to make it work in play.

Then, we combine the Black Plague and the Mongols (two big threats to hit Europe around this time) to create the apocalyptic demon Pestilence that is threatening to take over everything.  It starts in Jerusalem itself, but nobody is sure of the cause -- many blame the foul workings of the Templars.  And it infects not just the land but people and animals and plants as well, turning them into monstrous, infected demon-things, soldiers in the Pestilence's own crusade against the entire world.  The central demon lord of the Pestilence is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_%28Bible%29" rel="nofollow">The Beast</a>, after the demonic entity in the Book of Revelations, but it has never been directly confronted on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The Pestilence initially spreads like an infection, traveling through shipping channels from Jerusalem.  As such, it has taken Cyprus, much of Greece, and has advanced half-way up the Italian Penninsula, where the armies of Rome are struggling to hold it back.  Muslim forces in Seljuq Turkey have their hands full, while those in North Africa and Spain are struggling to destroy several beachheads the Pestilence has formed there, in Tunis and Gibraltar and Alexandria, before they continue to spread further.  Likewise with French forces in Marseille and British forces in Sussex.  No one is quite sure whether the Pestilence is also spreading East, into Persia, but it is assumed so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151842/#Comment_151842" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T09:22:55+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  9:22AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2008 9:35AM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PLAYER CHARACTERS!<br/><br/>1. Actual Templars and Hospitallers!  Knights of all kinds (Muslim as well as Christian), mercenaries, etc.<br/><br/>2. People partially infected with the Pestilence, who are expected to fight on the front lines, lest they spread the contagion further into Europe.  Of course, being infected gives you all sorts of crazy powers and abilities, like symbiotes in Wormwood.  Also, perhaps you begin hearing the voice of The Beast, whispering to you of its plans.<br/><br/>3. Priests, Imams, Living Saints!  Since the Pestilence is either the arrival of Third Horseman of the Apocalypse or some kind of apocalyptic plagues (like the Ten Plagues of Egypt), those marked by the divine discover that they can invoke prayers that manipulate it, driving it back, exorcizing the infected (to a certain extent), and even using it against itself.  In lands consumed by the Pestilence, where everything around them is one massive infected demon landscape, they can create hills, summon springs of water from the earth, and cause infected forests to part in their path.<br/><br/>4. The Dark Redeemers!  A monastery of evil Templars, convinced that they could control the dark powers of the Pestilence, refused to flee from the advancing infection.  Totally debilitated and transformed into demonic servitors, they served as dark champions for The Beast until they were fully exorcised by angelic hosts.  They confessed their vile crimes and committed themselves to fight on the side of the living, but their bodies remained horribly scarred by their contact with the Pestilence.  Consequently, they wear demonic masks, perhaps welded onto their heads such that they cannot ever be removed (Man in the Iron Mask style) as a sign of what they previously were and are widely shunned by most other soldiers.  Still, they still possess something of the demonic strength they once had and use it in an effort to make atonement.<br/><br/>5. Angelic Hosts!  The spirits of angels descended from the sky and possessed people who were without sin, usually children or youth.  These hosts for the angels always speak in the plural "we," as two entities bound together.  The ghostly wings of the angel spirits, which cannot fit within the human body, protrude from their backs, though only the most capable can use them to fly.  The bodies of angelic hosts are not immune from the infection, however, so there are even fallen angels, whose bodies have been consumed by the Pestilence with the angelic spirit still trapped inside.  These are among the most dangerous of the generals of The Beast.<br/><br/>6. The Armored Dead!  Sometimes, a soul is so consumed by the Pestilence that, when they are finally exorcised, there is little that remains of their body.  In such cases, a Living Saint or Angelic Host is sometimes able to bond the soul and remaining organs into a suit of sealed plate armor, thus allowing the soul to work off its accumulated sin (gained as a demon servitor) before moving on to the afterlife.  Such creatures are often rather alien to mortal understanding, but they are also valiant fighters who are nearly impossible to destroy.  Additionally, as very little of their body remains (and none of it open to the air), they are incorruptible to future infections by the Pestilence.<br/><br/>How's that?  What else do we need?

I was leaning towards Agon hack, actually.   Change the Fate track to "Infection," so you can gain more power by giving in to the Pestilence.  Maybe those who have already been rid of the Pestilence, like Dark Redeemers and Armored Dead, have a "Soul Corruption" track that they're trying to work off instead of gaining over time.  Keep Glory as is, but maybe make it collective, for the glory of God, instead of individual, so it wouldn't have the intra-party competitive aspect.  Have refresh scenes that are about the non-combat things that you do: healing people, inspiring people, dealing with your grief and regret, etc.  And those all would power the two-fisted combat part of the game.  Honestly, PTA isn't quite fighty enough for the mood I have in mind here.

You can order it from the Palladium website, in any case.  My expectation is that Kevin's going to want to keep reprinting it, even just in the low hundreds if it's not selling particularly fast, and not take the time to re-do the book or expand it like they did with Rifts Sourcebook 1.  That said, if he was ever interested in selling the rights, I would be very interested, but I doubt that's likely to happen unless Palladium's financial situation becomes even more dire than it has already been described to be (and my sense was that money was getting a bit easier for them).<br/><br/>I don't hate Palladium's system, actually.  I mean, I played it for 10 years, so it's pretty familiar and comfortable to me.  I just think it doesn't do anything particularly interesting and, having not been revised in a major way since... Palladium Fantasy Second Edition, I guess, it shows its age.  Also, I really think Wormwood should never have been a Rifts book.  It makes much more sense as an alternate world for Palladium Fantasy, but since Rifts was the hot property then (and Palladium Fantasy was still in its first edition when Wormwood was in development), they added all that stuff about everything on Wormwood being mega-damage and the like, when clearly it's not necessarily meant to be that way.  If anything, I think it'd be really cool if Palladium did a second edition of Wormwood for Fantasy, but I'm doubtful that would ever happen.<br/><br/>Palladium does have a publishing model that is relatively unique in its successfulness.  Everything Palladium publishes is compatible with everything Palladium has ever published (after a certain date) and all of it, even books from the 80s, remains in print and purchasable from game stores all the time.  In some ways, I think it's really cool that they're resisting the urge to put out a new edition of a game every 5 years, but there are also many things they could do, several of them very easy, that would make their publishing model even more successful and competitive in a shrinking market.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152104/#Comment_152104" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T12:21:41+00:00" title="June 21, 2008 12:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my first attempt at some <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/06/21/the-agony/" rel="nofollow">crusaderpunk Agon class abilities</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152322/#Comment_152322" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T21:55:55+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  9:55PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stupid internet, I lost my post.

And perhaps that can tie in somehow to any character improvements? <br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the Agon system, or I'd suggest something more concrete, but somehow that was the idea that jumped out at me when I was reading this.

Having player actions have a direct effect on the setting is definitely something missing from Wormwood, Engel, 40K, etc. where player actions don't ever seem to really make a dent in the larger war between good and evil (or lesser evil and greater evil, rather).<br/><br/>So, in Agon, Glory accumulates (calcifies?) into Advances, which are used to make your character better.  Advances are also tracked on a separate "Legend sheet," like gold stars in Kindergarten, so the players can compete to see who's the Most Gloriousest and have a solid record of how awesome they are collectively.  Definitely, the Legend Sheet for Agonia could take the form of actual things that you describe, like, "this gets better" and "we clear this area of infection."  Likewise, there should be some way for the GM to spend Strife or some other resource to make things worse in other areas.  Like, you clean out this area, and he can't take it back, but he can advance the infection into Prussia or something.

So you could try to take back Jerusalem, but the Pestilence might take Rome in response, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153345/#Comment_153345" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T09:27:50+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  9:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *<a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/business/4311008-map-of-europe-rounded-squares-pattern.php?id=4311008" rel="nofollow">cackles maniacally</a>*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153353/#Comment_153353" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T10:20:34+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 10:20AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jerusalem is in Europe? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153373/#Comment_153373" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T11:29:02+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 11:29AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_national_football_team" rel="nofollow">as of 1994</a> it is <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In any case, there's an Africa and Asia map too.
