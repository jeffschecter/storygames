                    Hey all, as I mentioned before my weekly group is going to pick up some kind of generic game (that handles SF) and play that for the better part of a year.<br/><br/>In my hunt through the Good Generics out there, I've found some pretty varied stuff: JAGS, d6, Action!/Fuzion (almost the same), Savage Worlds, GURPS Lite, EABA, and so on. The cookoff within my own group is quickly narrowing to Savage Worlds or GURPS Lite, with original JAGS and EABA "on deck".<br/><br/>Anyway, whichever we decide on playing, a few of us are buying (if they haven't already) Savage Worlds, and planning on running that in downtime and the like. It's a pretty slick game.<br/><br/>I remember hearing a lot of folks rave about it when it came out, and I took a look at it at the LGS. It came across as a pretty ho-hum everyman light gaming system, with a huge focus on miniatures and minis combat. So I didn't pay too much attention to it.  Fast forward to about a month ago, when I gave it a second look at the F... uh, no L... GS. I treated it as it was meant to be treated: As a generic game where you pick and choose the components you want to use and ignore the rest, instead of feeling compelled from using all the rules all the time. This time around, I found it to be quite clever, well built, and a high potential for the kind of gaming that I like; fast and fun.<br/><br/>Here's the main things that I like about the game:<br/><br/>1) The stepped die system.  So I get to use my d4s, d8s, and sometimes even d12s.<br/><br/>2) Most of the time heroes are rolling two dice at once (a d4/d6/d8 whatever, plus a 1d6 because That's How Heroes Roll).<br/><br/>3) MAJOR: As I went through the typical advantages and drawbacks area, I was pretty struck by the fact that they didn't include "Everything Under the Sun".  You'll notice if you look through Generic games that a lot of them contain and repeat most of the same advantages and drawbacks. Most of them, especially drawbacks, tend to be really far out there or useless, and just get in the way of the say 3-6 drawbacks that people would actually use (you have to fish them out of the text, getting around the "No Limbs" "Cannot Speak or Move", etc ones. Even Advantages, like Feats in D&amp;D, tend to boil down to two groups: The 5 useful ones, and the 20 ones that no one would ever take (they make no strategic or roleplaying sense).<br/><br/>However, there were FAR less of the "useless" advantages and drawbacks in Savage Worlds.  Most of the ones I saw I could easily imagine using with very little "work". That really changed my opinion of the game overall; it wasn't just another generic game someone slapped together, but rather a lot of thought went into even the traditional "Every Game Has These Things" elements.<br/><br/>4) Combat/Miniatures.  Normally I don't like either, because the rules tend to be either complicated or lame.  And yet, I enjoyed Mordheim (Warhammer-style fantasy small-party skirmish system), and found Savage Worlds' mini-bits to be a great successor to a marriage of "roleplaying system" and "miniature skirmish system". Unlike, say, my bad experiences with Conan OGL, which was like a roleplaying game constrained into a tight, tight girdle of complicated miniatures movement and strategy. I'm actually interested in buing a bunch of cardboard minis and racking them up.<br/><br/>5) Does System Matter?  Woah!  So, Savage Worlds has some elements of social conflict and the like (which I always love), but part of me really wants to dig into this system more simply because it's Just Structured Enough... and Rules Light Enough (weird phrase, that) to, I dunno, hopefully encourage more roleplaying by the players, and more risk-taking by the GM in setting dice-based stakes. It really does what it aims to do, and stays the fuck out of the way for everything else.<br/><br/>The other thing is that two of the players in my group have stepped forward saying that they're going to give GMing a try for the first time ever. This system is really appealing to them simply because of how little you have to have "memorized" to initially craft that scenario.  I'm probably going to have them use a copy of Savage Worlds with Andrew AKA Dr. Rotwang!'s Adventure Funnel stapled to it.<br/><br/>6) Character Creation. Two minutes. Seriously, when I ran a demo of it with my group, I was one character short. I said, "No Problem, cause it only takes two minutes to make a character anyway".  Jeremie pulled out his watch and said "Go", jokingly.  I laughed for a sec, then realized about 10 seconds in that he wasn't kidding.  So I ran through the rules, and made up a character, gave him skills and Quirks and all, even equipment ("gun"), and all the while flipping frantically through the book two or three times. When I said "Done!", I was at one minute and fifty seconds or so.  <br/><br/>In other words, there's no fear of character death (or at least not as much) like we had in some other games, where it takes like three hours to make a character from scratch if This One Dies.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's some of the cool things I found in the system.  It's not appealing to all the members of the group (namely one, which is why we're looking at GURPS Lite and the like), but a lot of us are digging it.<br/><br/>Anyone else have a preference for some generic system or other?  Why? What about it appeals to you?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Do things like PTA and Wushu count? The Solar System from TSOY? Generic Otherkind Dice?<br/><br/>I've always liked the original, freely-released version of Fudge. You don't pick things from lists. You just write down the important traits, rank them, and you're off.  If more stuff comes up in play, you write it down and rank it. You can use the core system to build complex mechanical things if you want, but it's pretty stripped down and lean at the core. That said, Fudge doesn't teach you how to do stuff you don't already know how to do.  But if you know how to do something, Fudge lets you give it mechanical weight.<br/><br/>That said, my favorite "generic" system is still TSOY, which has a lot of what I like about Fudge, but with additions that really help structure things.  Sure, generic Fudge lets you improvize completely weird, bizarre things ("We're all the zeitgeists of various ages! Let's narrate scenes in which the Cold War fights Transhumanism and see who triumphs!"), TSOY is going work pretty damn well for any semi-traditional thing you might want to run.<br/><br/>Last night at SG Boston, I ran Clint Kraus' hot new indie game <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=7691" rel="nofollow">Roanoke</a>, which is based on Wushu but has a few interesting additions, a lot of cool flavor, and helpful GM guidelines. I like a lot of what Wushu pulls out of the players (it's low-key player empowerment for people who're comfortable with Exalted's stunting rules, but not much else), but the way it structures character development and plotting (i.e. not at all) is not as satisfying as TSOY.  Makes me wonder what a TSOY/Wushu hybrid would look like, since both have been released under open licenses...                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I'm quite fond of Heroquest, aside from all its warty math...</blockquote>
For me, Heroquest is awesome but not quite generic enough for me.  The whole "What is your culture?" thing, that gives you a bunch of default skills and stuff, pretty much references the cultures of the Heroquest book with no guidelines for making up your own cultures. If you ignore Culture and all, it's pretty easy to roll with the "write your character as you play" mode.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Apparently, I really like HERO, as I've bought a metric dorkton of books for it.<br/><br/>As for SW... I bought it and <em>Necessary Evil</em> at GenCon '05, read about 12 pages of the core book almost a year later, and then sold them both. Enh.                        </div>

                            I'm in the process of reading the Savage Worlds core rules. I like what I've read thus far, though without rolling some dice I can't give it a strong recommendation. One thing that I have liked is it can be customized pretty easily. An important aspect for a generic system, I suppose. <br/>
<br/>
I was also impressed with The Shadow of Yesterday, which could also be a fine generic system. I'm not sure how easy it would be for new or inexperienced GM's, especially if using it for modern or futuristic settings. Some day I'd like to try using TSOY for old school martial arts/Shaw Brothers storytelling.                        </div>

                            My Wednesday night group has switched to TSOY exclusively, and we've never had a problem porting it to whatever setting we were using - most recently the Klondike gold rush and now the Firefly 'verse, and warring states China before that.  In each setting Keys, Secrets, and abilities need a little tweaking, but nothing difficult.  Just to be contrary, I think TSOY is a good system for new GMs, because everything you need to prep a session is right there in the Keys, and you can't spend much time prepping anyway.<br/><br/>The down-side of TSOY, of course, is the lack of a grinning skull in a jester hat.                        </div>

                            Andy, I have to be honest and say that I feel pretty much the same way you do about Savage Worlds.  It's a neat system with "just enough structure" to do all the heavy lifting for me and not enough to get in the way.  The whole group seem to like the level of crunch that if offers.<br/>
<br/>
I think I've described it as "The busy man's Gurps" on several occasions and still think that's about right.  It just doesn't bother with rules for a lot of things that aren't important.<br/>
<br/>
We've been having a whale of a time with it.  We use Lego figures instead of paper minis and it's the first time I've used minis since the 80s.                        </div>

                            I heart Savage Worlds. Big time. I've played and run it a lot, and it delivers. But you really need to be down with the battlemat. If I want some minis combat with my roleplaying (and yes, yes I DO) then I'll pick SW every time.<br><br>If I know you, Andy, you are gonna get a lot more fun out of SW than GURPS. Not that GURPS is a bad game system. But it makes my eyes bleed and the baby Jesus cry. I think our game preferences are similar, so your mileage may not vary. Given what you've said about SW so far, we're on the same page.<br><br>A fun thing about Savage Worlds: Character creation is super fast and easy, like you said. But if you're making Seasoned or Veteran level characters, chargen suddenly gets all deep and interesting, with lots of tough choices to make, similar to Burning Wheel chargen (but with less hair-pulling). The way edges breakdown into Background, Seasoned, and Veteran levels really makes for an interesting building puzzle to solve.<br><br>If I don't want to do the minis thing, though, it's TSoY or Fate for me. Those systems do what I want for "trad" gaming, and can handle any kind of situation set up, given a little prep. TSoY delivers more "issue-based" play, focusing on the drives and desires of the PCs as the main engine for play. I think Fate is better at straight-up genre emulation, and allows for a heavier GM hand in plot-based play, if you know what I mean.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Goal based I would say. The book recommends 1-3 XPs per session, so the players "level up" every two sessions (on average).                        </div>

                            Experience in Savage Worlds is awarded depending on overall party achievements per session.  Looking over the rules though, there's no real definition of what constitutes "Achievements", so it's mostly going to be one of those unwritten things.<br/>
<br/>
However, from the rulebook:<br/>
<br/>
Experience Awards:<br/>
<br/>
1 The group accomplished very little or had a very short session.<br/>
2 The group had more successes than failures.<br/>
3 The group succeeded greatly, and their adventure had a significant impact on the overall story.<br/>
<br/>
So from this we see at least hints that the experience should be awarded for progressing the story rather than just killing stuff willy nilly.  So killing a random group of orcs won't net any experience, but killing a very specific group of orcs may well do, as might convincing someone to change their mind on a specific issue.<br/>
<br/>
XP is awarded by whatever method your group usually uses.  That is to say, in my group the GM arbitrates, but players lobby for each others XP based on what they enjoyed during the session.                        </div>

This part is pretty interesting to me. If the dice didn't go your way all night or the group took on too powerful foes, they can't advance.

                            I've been drifting the Keys from tSoY in with idle thoughts.  If you halve the XP reward per key, they'd fit about right.  Obviously you'd need to keep an eye on how they worked out.  I mean, they system is designed to give players 3 XP per session on average.                        </div>

                            Not break <i>per-se</i>. I think the system's level of complexity and crunchiness are probably most rewarding to players if they gain one advance every two sessions.  That is:
<ul><li>One session to think "If only I had Power Foo",<br/></li><li>Then a session to say "I have Power Foo now! Neat, I can do this and this and that with it!",<br/></li><li>Then another session to go "Power Foo is cool and all, but if I also had Power Bar, it would be really neat!",<br/></li><li>Followed by a session where they feel "I have Power Bar now! Neat, I can do this and this with it, and by combining it with Power Foo, I can do that and the other!",<br/></li><li>Which is inevitably followed next session by "But Power Baz would also be great to have..."</li></ul>
One advance every 2 sessions seems to keep the "new toys" feel rather well.  About half the advances a player will buy are new Edges, so new powers/things they can do.<br><br>(Bugger, I can't get the hang of this list code)                        </br></br></div>

Well, as Monsieur Stokes commented, it depends on how you play. So, even a total dice meltdown could advance the story - probably in a tragic way. But, in the end, the players get their XP.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>Do you think the game would break with rapid XP accrual?</blockquote>
I don't think so. As the GM decides how much XP to give, he controls the pace of advancement, giving more or less to suit the campaign. <br><br>Also, there's a rule that let's players roll a d6 for each remaining benny at the end of the session. On a result of 5-6, they get an additional XP. But most GMs, or at least the ones who have cared to comment on this, don't use it since promotes hoarding.<br><br>Which is not the F!F!F! way. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Bennies are SWs universal currency.  They are spent by players for re-rolls, to avoid damage and in a couple of other ways.  They're a pretty bog standard karma mechanic that I'm sure you'll have seen a dozen times before.<br><br>Players start a session with a set number of bennies, usually 3, and can gain more by certain actions.  The GM is supposed to give them out for whatever they feel is appropriate.  So things like "good roleplaying", "being awesome" etc.  But as above, each group will decide how the bennies are awarded since there is very little in the way of hard and fast rules for dishing them out.  I tend to give them out whenever someone does something that the group agrees is awesome, whenever a player deliberately plays his character's personality in a way that makes life harder for himself and occasionally when players point out that I've forgotten a rule that would make life harder for the players.<br/><br/>But that's just how I use them, because that's the behaviour that I want to encourage.<br/><br/>Bennies work to even out the luck that could bugger up other games.  D&amp;D, for example needs to have combat's carefully balanced, because a too tough opponent can really bugger the players up.  With Bennies and similar mechanics though, a GM who has perhaps made an enemy a little too tough has the "buffer" of bennies to fall back on.  The players will spend them to even the fight out, to make a social encounter less difficult or to circumvent some other obstacle that the GM has placed in their way that they don't particularly want to engage with.                        </br></br></div>

                            Not as written.  As Torquemada mentions in his post, the book actually states that players roll a d6 for each bennie they have at the end of the session, and on a 5 or 6 they convert to XP.  They you start the next session with three bennies again.  Almost everyone ditches that rule because it leads to the hoarding of bennies, not the spending of them doing cool stuff.<br/><br/>Some groups run bennies on an goal/story/plot based system.  That is, you regain bennies when you achieve something or when you drive the story forward.  Personally I haven't run the game like that, but I can see why people want to.                        </div>

                            First, for those of you who are saying you're liking HQ, but have problems with keywords? Read the following, and let me know if it's still a problem: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.glorantha.com/support/na_keywords.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.glorantha.com/support/na_keywords.html</a><br/>
I wrote it specifically to address that "problem."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for Savage Worlds...I'd agree that it's the best system amongst the purely "task/non-intent specific" (to use the Hicksian model) supportive games out there. Easily the best, for all of the reasons Andy said.<br/>
<br/>
But, since FATE allows scaling between what Fred describes as "Task" and "Scene" resolutions, I think it's far superior to any of the rest of the pure generic games mentioned. You can do everything that SW can do with FATE (and just as fast or faster, I'd argue, given the FUDGE engine backing it), and if you don't want to play out a combat round by round or something, FATE has rules for handling that.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure it's pretty easy to drift Savage Worlds to this point, too, but that's not FATE's only advantage. FATE allows for movement into the middle (or even right) columns of Fred's chart with it's resolution, especially where Aspects are concerned. While still enabling the more traditional mode of play as well.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you want to enforce the very traditional mode of play, I'd argue that FATE wins of Savage Worlds in every category. It even beats out HQ in that it's easier to create frameworks for character construction in any genre (though HQ beats it out in terms of things like granularity, IMO).<br/>
<br/>
TSOY is better, I think, for play in Near, than as a generic game. But, given a write-up of the genre/setting in question, it's as good as HQ or FATE.<br/>
