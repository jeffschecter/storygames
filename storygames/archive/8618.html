The game definitely is much (much!) better with three heroes than with two.<br/>I did not, however, manage to get any of my new boardgaming friends to join me, as I'd originally planned.  They were all too busy with other things going on.  I'm still fairly convinced that they'd probably like the game, though, and I'm planning on trying to get them to join us for another session later.<br/>So here's my first question: what do you think is the best way to bring in a new player, in terms of mechanics?  Granted, there's only been one quest so far, but that Glory can really rack up fast sometimes.  So if there's new players and people that were in the first mission, should I make any changes?  Should I toss the new people some free glory or advances?  Should I make the returning players stat up fresh heroes instead of using their originals?<br/><br/>Beyond that, I have a few general wonderings.  I ran The Temple of Hera, and overall it went great.  I had no idea Menae would be such a tough obstacle just from looking at her stats, though!  For powers like her Gaze and Hold, is it acceptable to use them both between every exchange?<br/>In the end, they heroes decided they couldn't take her down in combat so they came up with a ploy to deal with her in another way.  Two of the heroes lured her outside, angering her until she gave chase, and the third one slipped inside.  I had the two leading her away engage her in a "non-combat battle" using athletics, and between exchanges the third make rolls to search for the horn.  Does that seem appropriate and acceptable?  I thought it worked pretty well, but after the fact I wondered if any of the special powers NPCs can have can be used in non-combat battles.  Many of them would function mechanically, but I felt like it would be unfair to blast them with her Fear and Gaze during the chase since those powers were the main reason they'd decided to flee the initial battle and engage her in another way.  On the other hand, special powers are the main thing some NPCs have going for them...<br/><br/>Finally, I was doing some speculating about NPCs and I realized that some of the special powers (like multi-attack) have no explicit limit to how many times they can be purchased.  I pondered the idea of an NPC with a maxed out sword and athletics, a sword in each hand, a large name die, an extra d8 purchased for offense, Extra Damage and then 5 purchases of Multi-attack.  As far as I can tell, he'd be technically legal (though using about the max strife with one hero have a d10 name die) and he wouldn't be good for anything but combat, but... that kind of build seems... well... pretty asshatty, I guess.  That was more me thinking out loud than asking any kind of question, I suppose.<br/><br/>more thoughts may come later.<br/>i really like agon.  i kind of wish it was easier to create NPCs at the table, but beyond that it's got a real nice mix of interesting crunch and fast-playing, simple to grok rules.  i'd really forgotten how cool it was.  or maybe i didn't quite get to taste its coolness with only 2 heroes and a quest whipped up on the spur of the moment.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190892/#Comment_190892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T13:22:06+00:00" title="February  2, 2009  1:22PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it I was me I would of ran the situation as you had.

Running the non-combat battle like that is perfect. For NPC powers in non-combat situations... just use your judgment. Sometimes they'll be appropriate and sometimes they won't.  Follow the advice on page 13 and don't worry about what "makes sense" -- just focus on making things tough for the PCs so they can seem heroic. If the NPC never uses some (or all) of her powers, then you can deduct those points from her Strife total and Glory reward. If it didn't help the NPC, it's not worth Glory after the fact.<br/><br/>If you ever need to make up an NPC on the fly, just grab the dice and powers that you want in the moment. Maybe make a note of them as you go. Then, if the PCs defeat them, total up their dice and powers to figure out the Glory reward. If you go over the Strife limit, it's usually not a big deal. In fact, you can play <i>really</i> loose with the Strife budget overall and it won't hurt the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190895/#Comment_190895" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T13:28:48+00:00" title="February  2, 2009  1:28PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, looking back at playing Agon with my group, they would have regarded that NPC as a great challenge, I think.

Agon's a cool game, and similar to more traditional games in some respects, but it still takes some getting used to.  I know I messed a few rules up and could have done a few things better, but everyone had fun.<br/><br/>Oh, another thing I wondered about...  I was looking through the book and (even though I'll probably run the Beast of Kolkoris if/when we do Agon next) I decided to roll up an Island and one of the quests was going to be Slay the Phoenix.  I though, "Awesome!  I'll start statting up a phoenix, just for kicks."  Of course it's a Monster, right, which means it can only be hurt by a particular weakness.  But as a Phoenix, it's got to have the Resurrect power, I figure.  So does that mean it basically needs to have two weaknesses?  One to hurt it in the first place, then another to make it stay down once it's defeated?  This sounds kinda harsh, but also pretty awesome.  Because I can definitely imagine me setting up the whole thing, cluing the players into the fact that they can't hurt the Phoenix with normal weapons and then someone saying, "Hey, we've got divine favor!  Let's just go beat it down with god-blessed weapons!"  And they could do that, but then it would just rise again.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  "It's a phoenix, what did you expect?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190913/#Comment_190913" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T15:21:48+00:00" title="February  2, 2009  3:21PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>Also, on the brutal combo with maxed out sword and athletics, that shouldn't be a problem.

My friends ended up deciding they could take on Menae in battle.  If they went up against some kind of uber-swordsman, they'd probably just have to do something like they did with her and find another way around.

You might say it can normally only be harmed by ice and cold, and to stop its resurrection, you need to scatter its ashes at holy sites. Something like that.<br/><br/>Oh, also, if you want to make Monsters more impressive, here's a more strict interpretation of the Divine Weapon rule:<br/>When you spend Divine Favor to empower your weapon, you still need to know HOW to empower the weapon to harm the monster. You call out to your god and ask them to bless your weapon in a particular way, in other words. "Oh, Poseidon, give my spear the icy cold of the depths of the sea!" etc.<br/><br/>This makes those Lore contests more important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191018/#Comment_191018" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T11:27:53+00:00" title="February  3, 2009 11:27AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh!  one thing i'd still appreciate advice on:<br/>do you think i should make any mechanical tweaks if a new player joins a group that has already played one or more quests?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191061/#Comment_191061" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T14:45:30+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  2:45PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I ran The Temple of Hera, and overall it went great.

Partially because he figured we'd probably only play once (or a few times) and being half-way up the fate track wouldn't be a big deal.  I used the option "Glory Multiplier" one-shot scoring posted on the Agon wiki, and as a result, despite having significantly more Glory than anyone else (that darn d8 name die really helped him out!) he came in second or possibly last after the multiplier since he checked off two fate boxes (one for being defeated at one point, one for finishing the quest) while everyone else only used one.  So now, he's d10 name die while everyone else is d6.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191082/#Comment_191082" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T17:23:49+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  5:23PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I GM, a new player gets no extra stuff for her hero when starting out.
