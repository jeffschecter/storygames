You didn't think you were interested in Philippa, but you gradually realise she's your most interesting character. <br/><br/>The problem is: she's only a secondary character. So, at the end of the game, you narrate whether Bertrand, your main character, burns at the stake. But you don't really care about him. You care about Philippa now.<br/><br/>Is there a hidden reason for this rule I'm missing? I know it enables the additional rule that You Can't Kill Someone Else's Main Character Without Permission. But that doesn't seem a good enough justification.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314083/#Comment_314083" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T04:42:07+00:00" title="February 24, 2011  4:42AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've encountered that, too, but never found it to be really troublesome.

But, as we play, I realise that Phillippa's marital relationship is more interesting to explore.<br/><br/>It really bothers me. I see what you mean: that choosing the main character is an interesting choice.

Much better than having a grumpy player that would rather play his secondary anyway. :-)<br/><br/>I only speak with the experience of three sessions. But I've had players that halfway through the game said "Umm, I really like this other character's story better.  I switch to him instead." The game didn't miss a beat.<br/><br/>We have also passed the secondary characters around the table if someone wanted to play in a scene where main and secondary characters belonged to the same player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314097/#Comment_314097" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T06:49:58+00:00" title="February 24, 2011  6:49AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2011 6:51AM by Graham.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to think that, after the 15-minute break, there should be a chance to change your main character. Just one chance. <br/><br/>Or, even, that that should be the time you choose your main character. In the first two acts, you don't have a main character and nobody can be killed without consent. From Act Three onwards, you must commit.<br/><br/>The thing is: I like the formality of having one main character. So, while we could always bend the rules, I'd rather the rules allowed us to change main characters.<br/><br/>I'm interested in passing around secondary characters. In some way, I like the formality of that rule, too: if one of your characters is in a scene, the others <i>cannot be there</i>, and you must explain why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Here are three things I like about the rule:\n<ol>\n<li>The rule is easy to communicate to new players - there are no exceptions or special cases.</li>\n<li>The characters introduced in the beginning of the story are those which stories are resolved at the end.</li>\n<li>There is no big group discussion up front - every player makes one smaller choice in turn, possibly as a consequence of what players before them have chosen and what have been created in the fiction so far.</li>\n</ol>\nConsider your secondary characters tools for exploring the main characters of the other players.<br/><br/>However, if you try out the option of changing characters after the break, let me know how it goes. It may have some interesting side effects.<br/><br/>/Frederik                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314169/#Comment_314169" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T23:42:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2011 11:42PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We ignore this main character rule now.
