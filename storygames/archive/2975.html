Okay.</p>\n<p>So, loresheets are modular setting/system such that if you have spent enough xp to buy them, then they are a guaranteed part of the setting/system. That's the first thing, the most important thing. There are 0 cost loresheets that are always part of the system, I'm not sure if the same is true for the setting. If no one buys a lore, then its elements may or may not exist as the GM feels like.</p>\n<p>Once your character owns a lore, he has expert knowledge within its purview. This has soft significance, and also hard significance in the form of destiny purchases:</p>\n<p>If you own a lore, you can purchase the things it lists, the different kinds of destiny. These can be lots of different things, like a special ability you have from having the martial heritage of a special person, to the ability to perform kung fu, to a contract with the GM to have specific event ocur in game.</p>\n<p>That's about all.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67629/#Comment_67629" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T14:09:32+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  2:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, having played a bit of WotG, I can safely say this: Lore sheets are setting as mechanics. Most of them evoke some part of the setting for a destiny (XP) cost and benefit the character. The neat thing is that they can be explore dynamically across and in between play. I'm really not sure how to clarify it more than that without specific examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67631/#Comment_67631" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T14:14:09+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  2:14PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You spend a view points and get 1 - 2 pages of text that your character knows - often history, religion, regional information, and other similar stuff.  Mechanically Loresheets make related Loresheets cheaper to buy, so if you know lore involving a religious belief then it may be cheaper to purchase regions where that belief is prominent, for instance.<br/><br/>Additionally, each Loresheet provides options for other things the character can buy - sometimes at a discount and sometimes exclusive to that sheet.  If you know the Lore surrounding a particular Weapon of the Gods then you may be able to hand over enough Destiny points to also know its location or even start the game with it.<br/><br/>In actual play I found them to be not so great.  Most players just didn't buy them because they involve reading and referencing several pages of text, which is difficult with only one or two copies of the book (especially in character generation).  Additionally, it can be difficult to incorporate them into the game when it otherwise seems like Lore rolls and such would be more appropriate.  Finally, from a mechanics perspective they're a bit of a waste of points because characters can regularly learn them in play through study (I quickly discovered this on my scholar).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67632/#Comment_67632" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T14:16:39+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  2:16PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are also some interesting loresheets that focus on relationships, and allow you to control NPC behavior to some extent, or create new ones.<br/><br/>For example there is one about courtship which allows you to spend a small amount of destiny to make a romantic interest more important to the story, or a bit more to make an NPC romantically interested in your character.

Or even for someone else's character to be central to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
