Are manque-characters necessary to sell the universe?<br/><br/>For example, I'd consider counting <i>Elementals</i> as fitting here, despite the existence of Captain Cadaver (due to origin) and Thor, but I'm not so sure about <i>Astro City</i> or <i>Planetary</i> or <i>Invincible</i> -- these three are arguable for various reasons. <br/><br/><i>Supreme Power</i> is right out.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/><br/>CU                </div>

                            Being a bit of a comic book junkie, I would say the the majority of the alt supers stuff apes the marque characters.  I am trying very hard to think of any supers books that don't and failing miserably.  Even fucking powers has the marque guys hiding in the corners...<br/>

What about the Valiant/Gold Key characters? Magnus Robot Fighter, Turok, Solar, et al? Valiant and Acclaim had limited success with them in the mid-90's.<br/>

Shreyas: It's about whether it's possible to write/create/play superheroes without somehow linking them, either explicitly or implicitly, with the characters and storytelling styles of the Big Two publishers, Marvel &amp; DC. I don't know if it's an interesting question to  someone who doesn't read superhero comics.                        </div>

                            I'd also argue that a lot of Shonen manga has its own set of rules when it comes to superhuman stuff. Take a look at Naruto or Hunter X Hunter for characters who are very clearly superheroes, but owe little or nothing to the American conception of what a superhero is.                        </div>

                            Also, to tie back in to the world of supers...<br/><br/>...I have a feeling that a lot of the canonical supers for that world/setting that appear in the games as the marques are little more than the author's gaming buddies' characters.  <br/><br/>I'm wondering if we can aim the topic (which again, discussing Fun Stuff without all the highfalutin' need to apply something to it or apply it to something == TOTALLY KOSHER HERE... but still I think we're losing something in the translation) towards more pragmatic questions, like:<br/><br/>Can a supers world without marque characters work? What would it look like? (A: Face of Angels)<br/>Why is there a need to make marque characters instead of keeping them in the shadows?<br/>What would it take to make a setting with marque characters that don't overshadow the PCs?<br/>What would it take to make a setting where marque characters that are inconsequential?<br/><br/>Any of those closer to what's rolling around in your head, Chad?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            In my ongoing Truth and Justice game there are several characters that became marque characters durring play, but none of them existed before the game started. <br/>
<br/>
The first thing we did when playing the game was make the PCs and their city, then looked at the "supers issues" they wanted to deal with and started off with them giving a couple of suggestions for NPCs that they might like and the types of villains they might like to face. <br/>
<br/>
I then went and stole lots of characters from other RPGs. This "stealing" mostly involved me finding a cool picture of the character, glancing briefly at what the character was set up to be, and then remolding it into the game. Following that mode we ended up with the following marquee NPCs: <br/>
<br/>
Alice, The Queen of Hearts = Stolen from SAS. Amusing because she's almost the evil twin of one of the PCs, and just happens to be sexually attracted to said PC. She's also the marquee type of every roguish mercenary ass-kicking gun-toting feme fatal in comic book history, with obvious and specific nods to Zealot and Silver Sable. Those with more knowledge of comic history can tell me where those characters came from. <br/>
<br/>
Protonic = Stolen from M&amp;M, redone so that he really is Superman without any of the Superman canon. He's become a favorite of the PCs because he lets them get into the "what makes a hero" and "what is our responsibility to the world" issues in ways that put them very visibly and directly in line with him, or directly opposed to him. And really, if you want to take on the iconic image of the superhero, its hard to beat Superman for it. <br/>
<br/>
Gaius Janus = Who started off as Janus from SAS, then became Lionell Luther from Smallville, then was turned to the side of the angels by the PCs, then became a god, then died, and is now back from the dead. He's really a slightly sexier, updated Lex Luthor who walks a line that's far more grey than black in response to the fact that many of our players are corporate managers and scientists, and so have a slightly different take on the "evil corporation and mad scientist" issue. <br/>
<br/>
The Dark Prince = A Brain in a Jar, as all brains in all jars. Except that this guy is a dolphin brain. Yes, a dolphin brain in a jar. He was made to be a one off to let us have some goofy DOLPHIN BRAIN IN A JAR TRYING TO MELT THE POLAR ICECAPS action, and instead he became one of the most formidable and compelling villains in the entire game. He is, at the structural level, quite clearly become Magneto. (In fact the players refere to him as "Magneto-dolphin-brain" and "The disembodied dolphin Jesus Christ in a hover mobile.") <br/>
<br/>
Atavist = Conan the Freaking Barbarian meets the Increadible Hulk in the universe of the X-Men. The boyfriend of the sexy femme PC felt inadiquate, got exposed to radiation at the lab he worked at, and gained the ability to change into a manly-barbarian warrior of unstopable strength whenever he felt jealous or helpless. <br/>
<br/>
I could go on, but I think the point is made. All of my NPCs can be traced pretty clearly to pictures and iconic images taken from supers RPGs, who were in turn taken from big name characters in comics. However, by putting the PCs first and building to suit them and the themes the group likes we've managed to combine a lot of iconic images with a lot of personal connection.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think my short form answer to Andy's question would be: I don't know if you can build a generic setting that will fit that well -- but you can take elements from settings and reimage them into your games pretty well. Really, its not too different than Marvel's "Ultimate" line.                        </div>

<br/>
There are a couple reasons to do it as a publisher doing a precanned setting. <br/>
<br/>
1) Iconic images and cliche. If you have an ersatz Superman then everyone knows going in what that character is about, what to expect from them in a general way, and how to use their relationship to the character to push their story. <br/>
<br/>
2) Because I want to play that world and don't have the liscence. Let us not forget that one of the big draws of the Marvel games of all types has been the ability to play Rogue or Spiderman and to make out with Storm and date Silver Sable. So what to do it you don't have the legal rights to it? Make it close enough that the urge can be satisfied without violating copyright. <br/>
<br/>
3) It's easier. You can make up your own themes, or you can draw on 75 years of the living Superman mythology that permeates every aspect of American popular culture. <br/>
<br/>
4) We're geeks.                        </div>

<blockquote>During this period, he produced the graphic novels *Bratpack *and *The Maximortal*, which were to be part of a planned cycle of books called *The King Hell Heroica*. Like *The One*, this series used elements of familiar superhero tales (in particular, a menacing parody of Superman, and fictionalized versions of his real-life creators) in a surreal, satirical, and extremely violent mode, exploring Veitch's stated belief that superheroes are a symptom of America's tendency toward fascism. *Bratpack* drew hostility from some critics, who saw homophobia in its portrayal of a flamboyantly gay superhero who molested his Robin-like sidekick; Veitch maintained that he meant this as a satirical exaggeration of the theories of Fredric Wertham.</blockquote>

                            Are ersatz versions of Big Name Supers necessary to garner attention? If so, why? If not, why do comics companies and RPG companies do it?<br/>
<br/>
Well, honestly, to show that their heroes could beat up the other guys heroes, especially before the big money in crossovers was found.<br/>
<br/>
Squadron Supreme (which has been re-imagined as Supreme Power) existed pretty much solely so the Avengers could fight the Justice League (Which lead to one of the few good points of the recent JLA/Avengers crossover, when Hawkeye complains that these guys are just a Squadron Supreme knockoff).  Similarly, the Shi'ar Imperial Guard seem pretty much created so the X-men could fight the Legion of Super heroes.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, there's obviously something to be said for using familiarity to illustrate something new (as Supreme Power illustrates).  Note that comic companies are even doing it to themselves with things like DC's else-worlds and Marvel's Ultimates.  Ripping off something iconic lets you take all the good parts (specifically those that make it iconic)  without the cruft (White Kryptonite kills plants? WTF?!?!).<br/>
<br/>
I am, by the way, delighted to discover that my spellchecker doesn't like cruft, but it's ok with kryptonite.  :)<br/>

<p><code>Okay, how about let me phrase it this way: "Why do characters in other comic book superhero universes and superhero RPGs often look like knock offs of the SuperFriends?"</code></p>
<p>Ah, got it.</p>
<p>My first, biased-against-American-supers guess: The genre has some built-in expectations about what makes an "acceptable" superhero, and these are more or less based on derivation from entrenched characters. I feel like all the superhero cartoons and movies I've seen point to this.</p>

Did you ever see the Indian version of Spiderman? It was set in either Dehli or Mumbai, and was pretty much Spider Man with a dhoti. (http://www.gothamcomics.com/spiderman_india/)<br/>
<br/>
I always wondered how it would sell, considering that it pretty much looked like they changed the setting and the tone, but kept all the Americanness of the themes of power, adolescence, and coming of age issues.                        </div>

                            Part of the question, in my mind, spins around the question of "are superheroes a genre to themselves, or merely a setting element"?  When the latest MURPG came out, I ran a spy-themed game using it.  The 'heroes' were at least as powerful as 'standard' supers, but there were no marque-heroes - quite simply, part of the over-plot was that the secret government conspiracy kept super powers a secret so they could control that power.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would also urge you to consider Jungian archetypes. It is arguable that superheroes are popular for the same reason mythologic figures are/were - they personify innate personality elements we see in ourselves. Thus it seems a nature extension that they become even more iconicized as marquee-characters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I would say that comic book characters create marquee-heroes to sell books.  Marketing folks would say it's easier to sell something with an easily identifiable icon/logo.                        </div>

My first impression? "Man, that is a completely implausible name." Whatever it was.</p>
<p>I didn't read into it that much, but I suspect much the same thing you do - the themes of Spiderman (and, uh, most superheroes I know anything about) are intensely American, and possibly a sub-set of that, even; I know that, personally, they don't do anything for me, even after an upbringing immersed in American media.</p>

                            I think there's a bit of a bias in perception here.  Actually, there are tons of comic book universes which don't have those characters.  Prince Valiant, Tintin, Asterix, Finder, Strangers in Paradise, and so forth on endlessly.  <br/><br/>But for something to be called a superhero comic pretty much by definition is imitating DC and Marvel.  If it doesn't look like them, it's not called "superhero".  It seems you're looking for something which imitates spandex, general superpowers, and other conventions -- but not those particular characters.  <br/><br/>Of your examples, I'm only familiar with <i>Astro City</i>.  Your implication is that the parallel characters are necessary to sell the universe, but I don't think that's quite true.  <i>Astro City</i> is very deliberately similar to the classic comic books.  It's not imitating simply to sell.  It's imitating because that's what it's content is.  It is expanding on, exploring, and deepening the superhero myth.  And icons are a part of that.                        </div>

                            Uh, John... the post is specifically about superhero comics and superhero RPGs, and pretty much says that at the top. So sure, we're not talking about things like Mouse or Artesia or Promethea or the millions of others -- because we're looking at Supers, not at comic books as a whole. <br/>
<br/>
Although, if you want to look at places where things cross in and out of the line of super/non-super something like Sleeper: Out in the Cold might be an interesting place to start -- it takes place in the "supers" Wildstorm universe, right alongside the Authority, but is built to be a noir/crime comic where people just happen to have super powers. Because of that there are few marquee characters, and the archetype characters are those of a different type: the feme fatal, the bruiser, the double agent, and so on.                        </div>

In High School, some friends and I used the MSH role-playing game to make our own supers universe.  I don't think we had anything resembling the Big Supers, though.  The closest we came was Ultimate (I think his name was? -- he didn't stick in my head) who had the "guy who flies and has a fortress of solitude" thing from Supes -- but he was employed by the US Govt. and his major power was an extensible staff.<br/>
<br/>
We were strongly influenced by early Image stuff (WildCATS and Cyberforce and Union miniseries) and as such we weren't really into the big guys.  Shockingly, the message we got out of that stuff was "invent new supers and new super-powers, it's okay."  And it was.<br/>
<br/>
In other words -- I think it's possible, but I think that most people who write for comics are interested in the old supers that they grew up with, so they tend to emulate them.<br/>

                            Brand, I was trying to answer the question.  <br/><br/><i>Are ersatz versions of Big Name Supers necessary to garner attention? If so, why? If not, why do comics companies and RPG companies do it?</i><br/><br/>I think the answer is no, ersatz versions of Big Name Supers are not necessary to garner attention.  <br/><br/>In the case of Astro City, I think that it has ersatz versions of Big Name Supers for the same reason that it has spandex, secret identities, and superpowers -- because it is deliberately paying homage to classic DC and Marvel comics in forming its mythology.  <br/><br/>Beyond this, I am going to extrapolate somewhat.  I posit that the set of comics we are looking at here (i.e. "superhero comics") are all imitations of Marvel and DC by definition.  That is, if they don't look much like Marvel and DC, then they aren't classed as superhero comics.  So given that by definition they are imitating, it is only natural that within this set we see a lot of iconic characters imitated.                        </div>

Yea, I figured that out shortly after I posted. <br/>
<br/>
However, I think that there has been more variation in superhero indie comics than that. I, at least, would call a lot of indie people-with-big-powers superheroes -- its just that few of them have garnered the kind of market that those with the marque characters do. <br/>
<br/>
Really, it sort of seems like super comics got stuck in a catch-22: if you stick with what the big boys are doing you'll only be a shadow, and if you don't then you'll never hit it big. <br/>
<br/>
Which may be why most of the energy in comics and graphic novels these days seems to have gone into other genres. Not dissimilar to the early 50s, actually.                        </div>

                            Well, I don't really have that broad a comics knowledge, particularly for superhero comics, so I can't speak that broadly.  I love Astro City, which definitely has imitations of marquee characters (like Superman-&gt;Samaritan).  However, I don't feel that what Astro City is doing makes it "only" a shadow.  I think it stands pretty well on its own.  <br/>
<br/>
Something to consider is that the marquee characters have been very thoroughly tested and developed for decades.  Essentially, both DC and Marvel have tossed a whole lot of characters out into the world, and the ones which stuck and became popular really do have a cultural icon status, perhaps representing something important rather than being simply random.  If that is the case (which I think it is in at least some cases), then there is a good point to taking after them.                        </div>
