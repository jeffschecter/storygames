It's important.<br/>\nOur community is huge, and we meet on many different websites. The biggest three sites are:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://polter.pl/" rel="nofollow">Poltergeist</a> - a site about anything bound with sf and fantasy genre. Movies, comics, books, games, stuff. But it's base always was, and always will be traditional rpg. Most registered members are players. Lately Polter starts to come out from the sf niche, and starts publicing rewievs of non fantastical genre of comic books, movies, and books. This is due to the unexpected boom of non-rpg readers coming on the site. Effect: 900.000 uniqe people at the website a month.<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://valkiria.net/" rel="nofollow">Valkiria</a> - a little smaller, but still huge site. Considered "rival" to Polter by some users on both sides.<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.gildia.pl/" rel="nofollow">Gildia</a> - also a known source of news for readers and gamers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to advertise your game on any or all of these websites, all you have to do, is to write a mail to their owners. In 90% of cases, they will create a news article about your game. If you'll give them a copy for a review, they will do it gladly, and post again.<br/>\n<br/>\n* * *<br/>\n<br/>\nNow. I'm designing a free game. I want to advertise it worldwide, on german sites, on british sites, on italian sites, french, spanish, american... Everywhere. I spent some time looking for similar websites around europe, and I just couldn't find them. Now there can be two reasons for this: There are no sites such as those in poland (big in numbers of users), or they are not positioned very well in Google, or I'm just lame searcher.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: You, people of Story Games, who come here just like me, from distant and exotic parts of the world, probably know such sites in <b>your </b>country. Why don't we create a base of such sites around the world? Sites, that we could use to advertise our games, to simply <b>make more people play them</b>? I would say, that we already have polish sites checked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often wonder, why none (or very little at least) of your games were advertised on Poltergeist. If they were, it was always a fan initiative, not the authors. Why don't we advertise INDIE games on non-INDIE sites? It is RPG, is it not? Why do authors stick to the very few, international sites, and don't try direct advertisement? (This is not the main question of this thread. It's considered rethorical. So please, let's not change this thread into discussion about ways of advertisement, and stuff, okay? Whisper me, if you want to talk about that, and we'll create a proper topic.)<br/>\n<br/>\n* * *<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now, updated list of worldwide RPG sites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>GERMANY</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.blutschwerter.de" rel="nofollow">Blutschwerter</a> \u2013 mostly for WoD fans<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.tanelorn.net" rel="nofollow">Tanelorn</a> \u2013 big fantasy portal<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.dnd-gate.de" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D; Gate</a> \u2013 name says all<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.rpg-foren.com/forum.php" rel="nofollow">RPG Foren</a> - forum about RPG<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>HUNGARY</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rpg.hu/" rel="nofollow">RPG HU</a> - good hungarian portal<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>NORWAY</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.n4f.no/" rel="nofollow">Hyperion</a> - big, fiction-themed portal<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://imagonem.net/" rel="nofollow">Imagonem</a> - another big portal.

Over on all other English sites (RPGNet, Story-Games, Fear The Boot, EnWorld, Circus Maximus, TheRPGSite, etc) there's a place reserved for posting an informational or news thread about your game. There are also often news feeds where you simply submit a PR and it gets listed with a minimal approval. Anyway, those are some sites to look into advertising on, and by "advertising" I mean "posting a forum thread in a promotional area of the site".  <br><br>You can choose to advertise (using actual money) on those sites as well. I don't have an advertising system in place (yet; most likely never) but RPGNet has a "pay money to list a banner" system. Not sure how much it costs, but you can inquire at the site. I know one of our local game stores advertises there regularly.<br><br>Polish aside (which is the lingua franca of Poland, and not really anywhere else), English is spoken in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and the like. So there aren't really, to date, any "Australian RPG sites", "American RPG sites", etc... it all falls into "English RPG Sites" (aside from local meetup sites of course, like NerdNYC etc). <br><br>Sorry, I'll also take a stab at your rhetoricals:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Raphael Sadowski</cite>I often wonder, why none (or very little at least) of your games were advertised on Poltergeist.

That's what we are doing here, right? When I said "mail them" I was thinking "mail them in <b>english</b>". Any one of the three forums would understand. Heck, if you would write in english, they would be <b>more</b> interested. So no, I don't think that language is an obstacle of any kind.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">It sounds like those sites have a really authoritarian bent, if you have to contact the owners of the site to post an advertisement.</div>\n</blockquote>\nYou are talking about forums. I'm talking about a renown website. Of course it is being <b>run</b> by some people. If you want to get an advertisement, more even: a free advertisement on their site...? It sure seems logical to contact the people who are doing that. Not any user can edit and write a news in an online newspaper, right? So that's the difference. You are talking about forums, I'm about web portals.<br/>\nI dunno how to put this... For example. Did you clicked the link to Poltergeist? Check it. Look how it looks like. There is a great work behind all of that. So I'm not talking about some fan-supported forums. I mean - nothing wrong with that. But if I want an advertisment? Posting about my game in 4 different forums in a thread called "here be the new games" isn't even comparable to the news, and revision, with pictures, on the front page.<br/>\nOf course, I wouldn't ever say that by one news message on Polter, your game will get 50% more players, no. Or that a news in a country renown sf and fantasy, or gaming website will give you more possible audience than posting on <b>international</b> forums. Make it <b>01%</b>. And then find 50 such sites. That's why I opened this thread.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">For me, I'm wondering if the investment in getting an advertisement/promotion in another language wouldn't be worth the payoff (in terms of sales, or in terms fo "work" vs "the amount of people who will actually check out the product" etc.</div>\n</blockquote>\nI can sit down in front of the computer, and write same mail, in english to 20 sites at once. All about my project, sample shown. Invite them to write a review. Bah, if your product is free - go on, invite them to distribute it online by themselves, as an only distributor in the country. Make them feel important.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Also, other authors try different things; for example, Chad Underkoffler advertised his Dead Inside and other games on some popular webcomics. I'm not sure how it paid off for him, but there are others who spread out, find a communtiy or area that works with their game, and advertises on them (paying for the privilege, even!).</div>\n</blockquote>\nTheres an example of a good marketing idea. That's what I'm talking about. Although I would mostly look for places to get <b>free</b> advertisement. People, who would be actually <b>excited</b> about promoting a game. Or people, who would think that it is <b>their job</b> to let everybody know about the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sorry for the OT. Do you think that maybe this thread should be split? I mean, I kinda wanted to create "game advertising" thread later, but since we started...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180944/#Comment_180944" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T03:09:10+00:00" title="December  1, 2008  3:09AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not too much in the way of active forums to advertise games on here in Korea...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180949/#Comment_180949" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T04:32:01+00:00" title="December  1, 2008  4:32AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main roleplaying site in hungarian is <a href="http://www.rpg.hu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rpg.hu</a>. Paying for a banner might be possible, but not what I'd do if I wanted to reach the site's visitors. Getting your game on the main site goes like this: someone who knows hungarian writes a review about your game and sends it in. I did that for Universalis for example. Not sure if this resulted in any copies sold, but overall awareness about the game grew from non-existent to "I think I heard about that somewhere." You might be able to get special offers and newly published games on the main page without a hungarian language review, if it's not too frequent.<br><br>About numbers: The site has over 77k registered users but most accounts are of the one-post-and-forget type from when roleplaying was more popular here in Hungary. Articles on the main page have around 1k reads the month they were published. You should keep in mind that differences in wages, postal fees, language problems and higher barrier for online purchases (online transaction capable credit cards are less prevalent here) mean you'll probably get much less purchases from 1000 hungarian players who read an article about your game than from 1000 american ones.
