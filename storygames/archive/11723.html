They called this subgenre <i>cyberpunk</i> and two major games came out of it: <i>Cyberpunk</i> and <i>Shadowrun</i>.  They were both cool in their own way, though <i>Shadowrun</i> definitely had a more successful run that continues to this day.<br/><br/>Caught up in the writing of William Gibson, George Alec Effinger and Walter Jon Williams (among others), I was totally into cyberpunk as a literary movement and as a gaming environment.  I ran both <i>Cyberpunk</i> and <i>Shadowrun</i>, the latter for several years.  But both games had the same problem: a solitary figure that somehow had to be incorporated into a group-play situation.  No, he wasn't the decker, though that "class" presented problems all his own.  Rather, he was the <i>rockerboy</i>, and I could never make him work.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough with the "once upon a time" stuff.  Let's talk rockers.<br/><br/>The biggest problem faced by the GM when trying to incorporate a decker into a cyberpunk group is that while he was doing his thing everybody else sort of got to hang around twiddling their thumbs.  Similarly, in order to have a rockerboy doing rocker stuff, the <i>adventuring</i> had to come to a halt in order to accommodate the music.<br/><br/>In both my <i>Cyberpunk</i> and <i>Shadowrun</i> games I had players that wanted to play rocker-types.  Which is cool because the basic idea behind the rockerboy type is a good one.  Who <i>wouldn't</i> want to play a cool, sexy musician type with groupies and the whole thing?  That's a fantasy just like being a hardwired street samurai.  The problem of integration kept coming up, though, and I was repeatedly faced with the not-so-great options of either ignoring the musical aspect of the character in favor of treating him like any other adventuring type (albeit one with some useless skills) or having everyone else standing around cheering while the rockerboy played a blistering guitar solo.  You see my conundrum.<br/><br/>Probably the easiest solution would be for <i>everybody</i> to have a role in the band.  Sort of an ass-kicking bunch of musicians who supplement their income with a little shadowrunning on the side.  But that has its problems when it comes to the players who don't <i>want</i> to spend skill points on things that don't contribute directly to kicking ass and taking names.  The rockerboy archetype is attractive, but not to everyone.<br/><br/>I figure there are other, more nuanced ways to solve this problem so I'm curious to know how you \u2014 yes, you, the one reading this \u2014 would address the problem of rockerboy integration.  Would it be from the story side or would it be a character-based solution like the one posited above?  Have you actually had to deal with this problem in your own game?  How did you resolve it?  And so forth.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261572/#Comment_261572" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T05:12:40+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  5:12AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'm totally unhelpful here but . . .<br/>Wasn't there a game about playing a rock or metal band?

IIRC, the characters needed to bust into an Arasaka building to rescue Johnny Silverhand's gf (Johnny was a pregen, but I think you were encouraged to sub in a PC Rocker if you wanted).  So, Johnny plays a huge concert outside Arasaka HQ and uses Charismatic Leadership to cause a riot (yeah, the scenario is a little railroady - but that's a *different* problem) while the Nomad and Solo sneak in during the chaos.<br/><br/>The general point is that, as a GM, you can work with Rockers so long as you provide them ways to contribute to the overall group goal.  Yeah, there might be some cutting back and forth (that's the best way I had to handle Netrunners too - we used the more "realistic" Hardwired rules, so our net jockey mostly came along and hacked security terminals rather than spending a lot of time in VR), but it's not as if everyone is sitting back doing nothing.<br/><br/>That said, I know back in the day when I played Cyberpunk we suffered a lot from not treating it as different enough from D&amp;D.  Specifically, I think a lot of the Roles suffered if you treated the characters as an adventuring party - Rockers and Medias just ended up being weird and hard to integrate, Nomads, Corporates, and Cops couldn't use their connections to full effect, etc.  While "everyone is in the band" isn't a bad idea, either, I think the more general lesson is that to use Cyberpunk characters to full effect people need to come to some consensus about the nature of the group and tailor character concepts to fit it.  If someone shows up with a Rocker and all your games are about corporate espionage runs, it's not going to work.  Similar things apply if you're not actually playing Cyberpunk but trying to integrate Rockers with other character types, etc.  But if you've got a group of players, one of whom wants to rock out on guitar all the time and the others who just want to kill stuff, you may just not have coherent preferences.<br/><br/>Never played Shadowrun, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261619/#Comment_261619" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T08:39:42+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  8:39AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Shadowrun</i> provided a touch more freedom because there weren't classes to choose from, so one can build whatever sort of character one wanted, though there were pregen "archetypes" that a player could choose from in order to get right into the action.

Playing music is just what they do when they're not shooting people. The problem is that the mainstays of cyberpunk games (deckers and solos/street samurai) don't do anything but shoot people or steal stuff. They're one-note character types, as presented on paper.<br/><br/>The deal is, here's what you're doing and here's what you're risking and here's where your skills from one life can affect the other. Corporates as a character class? What, when they're not making 2x the same amount of money legally? Medics and techies as classes? These are the guys you go to before and after the job, not the guys you bring with you. Media? Oh yeah, that's a great idea.

If it were released now \u2014 with the requisite updates to its mechanics to reflect the state of the art, of course \u2014 we'd have a much better handle on how to handle its sort of narrative, but at the time we were almost all coming from some variety of D&amp;D-ish background where <i>party unity</i> was the be-all and end-all of gaming organization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261648/#Comment_261648" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T09:43:21+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  9:43AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My two cents: I think the problem is that many of the things that make Cyberpunk work as a literary genre are precisely what make it painfully unsuitable for this kind of gaming. William Gibson is a Marxist of sorts (<i>calm down</i>, Yanks - he's said this on numerous occasions, I'm not a commie or a conspiracy theorist) and the plots of his novels are constructed so that individuals simply don't really have very much power to change the world they're living in. If you want to run a game in a Gibsonesque world with a truly activist group of player characters, they'd have to be corporate bigwigs of one sort or another. I think that the system this is most likely to work is probably something closer to the style of <i>Reign</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261655/#Comment_261655" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T09:57:54+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  9:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jumping back up to your response to me...<br/><br/>I used Cyberpunk just because it's the game I played a lot of.  And you're right, having Rockerboy as the first Role in the book kind of encourages you to play a Rockerboy.  But I'm not sure that the solution, even in a more freeform game, is anything besides gaming best practices - that go back to the bad old "trad" days.  In Red Box D&amp;D, and in D&amp;D 4E, you kill stuff, and you pretty much can't create a character who's bad at that, or who doesn't fit into a killing-stuff group, without trying *really* hard.  In any other version, there was always the guy who wanted to play, like, the Bard/Psionicist (Psychoportation) who was useless in a fight but could go to the Astral Plane (alone).  The solution in any genre is either to sit everyone down until you come to consensus on the kind of stories you want and what kind of characters fit those stories, or just say, "No, dude, we're going into  dungeons.  Go home and come back with someone who can swing a sword."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261661/#Comment_261661" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T10:19:39+00:00" title="March 12, 2010 10:19AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Buckaroo Banzai<br/><br/>[/thread]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261676/#Comment_261676" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T11:21:07+00:00" title="March 12, 2010 11:21AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2010 11:27AM by Wordman.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Presented without comment: <a href="http://exalted.xi.co.nz/wiki/wiki.pl?BoyBandsIntro" rel="nofollow">details of an Exalted campaign focused around a rock band</a>.

Take what you read in the book (and the new one for that matter! the 203x version which is kinda cool with the updated info) with a grain of salt, and instead think of the movies and books you love and what the characters do in them.<br/><br/>I think its a misconception that all cyberpunk characters do is fuck shit up with their uberhuge destructoid guns. I mean, that's definitely a fun part of the game. But those other characters definitely exist because they're a part of a really rich setting. In blade runner, there's alot of shoot outs, for example, but really its very film Noir in its psychology and detective fiction tropes. There's tons of downtime and relationship drama in Neuromancer, and the main character is horrible with weapons, so much so that it becomes almost a running joke. Johnny Neumonic is just an information runner who needs a badass to protect him... etc. I think its the weaknesses in cyberpunk characters that make them really interesting, and how vulnerable they are despite the amazing amounts of technology around them.<br/><br/>Think of the performers that exist in other games and what they do when they're not performing, IE a bard character, a singing elf, a daeva musician. I think being a Rockerboy has the same dramatic elements in it as a character does with any other profession in an RPG. Find ways to tie it in! Maybe he's like Bob Marley, and wanted by the government. Maybe she's like Lady Gaga, and is a fashion icon who does radical performances to influence culture. Maybe its like Lestat in that Anne Rice book where he's giving out vampire secrets to the populace and the vampire population comes to kill him. Maybe rival musicians are out to get them.<br/><br/>Really, the performance itself is always gonna take a back seat in RPGs, because for the most part, people don't pause the game to actually get out their guitar and larp it out, the same way people fade to black during romance scenes. Generally, you describe a line or two of the performance. Try to tap into the parts of the personality that reflect things related to the game.<br/><br/>I dunno, that's how I would do it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261681/#Comment_261681" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T12:08:38+00:00" title="March 12, 2010 12:08PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>I think its a misconception that all cyberpunk characters do is fuck shit up with their uberhuge destructoid guns.</blockquote>\nThat's definitely the case when I think of <i>Cyberpunk 2013</i>, which was the version of the game I ran/played.  It seemed pretty clear to me that players were being encouraged to play the sorts of characters Gibson imagined, namely low-on-the-totem-pole, struggling figures on the periphery of society.

Alot of the RPG does. Definitely have that. I think one of the coolest things about the original Cyberpunk is how easily and quickly you can die. But, don't have *just* that, if you can help it. That's what stats like "cool" and random charts for tattoos and mohawks are all about. Style over substance all the way, but there's definitely non-combat parts of those stories too, if I'm not beating a dead horse by mentioning that again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261778/#Comment_261778" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T01:16:53+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  1:16AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I particularly like what Jared and Kira have said in this thread so far. <br/><br/>As Jared and Brand pointed out, the rockerboy\u2014I'm speaking of rockerboys in general terms, not specifically the Cyberpunk game role; I have next to no experience with the Cyberpunk game itself, so I don't know how well it would actually support playing a rockerboy in this manner\u2014isn't really about being a musician, it's about communicating with others. Rockers are potent because they have connections, because they can make connections within the community, because they can rally the community spirit and get people working together, because they have the charisma and passion to lead the rebellion. One thing that still surprises and amuses me about music videos from the early '80s is the recurring theme of rock as rebellion against corporate/fascist oppression. There was a real strong sense, born from the folk movement and nurtured by the punks (hence "cyberpunk", naturally) that music could be used to rouse the people to challenge the status quo and make changes for the better. That's what the rocker role should be about. That's what keeps the group from being just another band of heartless mercenary shadowrunners. <br/><br/>Rockers can also use their social and communication skills in many different situations: negotiating safe passage through gang territory (or even recruiting a gang for help), finding people with information the group needs, making contacts in the corporate world, maybe just bluffing the group past suspicious guards... As Kira and others indicated, a cyberpunk game should have combat but it should be pretty lethal, and finding ways to avoid violence but get what you need should be a common activity.<br/><br/>A few years ago when my group played Prime Time Adventures, I pitched a series based on that concept of the rock band as underground rebels, but no one else was that interested. Reading this thread, I again really want to play that kind of game some time...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261781/#Comment_261781" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T06:01:59+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  6:01AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For cyberpunk &amp; rockerboys, maybe try something rock/cyberpsychadelic with Misspent Youth.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>But, don't have *just* that, if you can help it.
