(And here is <a href="https://weaving-stories.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/what-is-old-school-renaissance.html" rel="nofollow">a blog post</a> where I try and sum up our creative agenda, if that helps).<br/><br/><i>In addition to awarding XP for gold (i.e. for challenges overcome), award some other currency for things that are against the character or party's interest, but which result in more entertaining play. Let's call these "MP", or "meta points".</i><br/><br/>MP would be gained for doing things like:<br/>* Playing a shapeshifter who has killed and replaced your character. Perhaps MP would be awarded for each party member dies as a result of your actions.<br/>* Roleplaying (perhaps to the bitter end of character death) your character's gradual corruption at the hands of The One Ring, and their unwillingness to part with it, despite the player knowing full well it's a bad idea.<br/>* Being unwilling to harm elves, because of your character's debt to them - even though in this situation the elves are manifestly willing to harm you.<br/>* Bellowing war chants to Ur-grok before entering a dungeon level, as befits your barbarian sense of honour.<br/><br/>I've deliberately gone from more-specific scenario-based ones at the top of the list, to more "this is just roleplaying your character" ones at the end of the list. I'm not sure where the cut-off should be.<br/><br/>MP would be used at character creation to give you a better chance of a better character. So, for example, 1 MP might equal 1 reroll on a primary stat (Str, Dex, Con...). You can save them up. MP do nothing to help your current character. The idea is that the game is still primarily rewarding skilful play that defeats challenges. But this gives a way to incentivise players to act against that where the groups agrees that would be fun.<br/><br/>This is not an attempt to turn OSR into a narrative game.<br/><br/>Thoughts?

I am particularly, strongly, in favour of not devaluing the XP system by giving XP for "good roleplaying", so in that regard one might say that I favour this approach very much when compared to some more stupid alternatives [grin]. I've mulled over similar ideas myself in the past, but haven't quite convinced myself to implement them.<br/><br/>One addition I'd like to make is that for me the biggest use for the meta points would be to award them as explicit recognition of active participation in the parts of the game that I wish the players were more conscientious about. The following would all be worthy of rewards at my table:<br/><b>*</b> Hosting duties<br/><b>*</b> Organizing and cleaning up the cartography files and character stables<br/><b>*</b> Coloring in the main maps for ease of use<br/><b>*</b> Writing up your strategic planning in advance of game session<br/><b>*</b> Maintaining party inventories and doing high-quality logistic work<br/><b>*</b> Doing the NCO or party leader roles during the session<br/><b>*</b> Maintaining a calendar and tracking time<br/><b>*</b> Doing after action reports and journalling for later reference<br/><b>*</b> Any other active participation in the maintenance of the game space that actually enables the passive players to say "I hit it" when their turn rolls around<br/><br/>Another important point I'd like to make is that were I to do something like this, I would definitely award the meta points through committee work, sort of like PTA Fan Mail. This is nearly what I do with XP anyway, as I consider a mountain top GM distributing largesse a poisonous group structure, but when it comes to stuff like "good sportsmanship" awards, I don't think that the GM has any sort of moral justification for being the gatekeeper; the other players need to have a word in there. Could be voting, could be that everybody individually has the right to grant points to others, could be that the GM acknowledges and the others veto - whatever works.<br/><br/>Regarding the actual uses of the meta points, here are some ideas that I would institute myself:<br/><br/><b>Special chargen and development options:</b> start a character in a prestige class or otherwise extraordinary position. Modify the character build during downtime. Be a heir, have an in-built adventure hook, play a vampire instead of a fighter, find an exceptional teacher, that sort of thing.<br/><br/><b>Vote for campaign direction:</b> pick what we'll focus on next in the campaign (in cases of legit choice, not just to bully other players); play your character's side-quest first, before the other guy's.<br/><br/><b>Play dollhouse:</b> in the parts of play that are not challenge-oriented, use points to gain GM favour in negotiating imponderables. Get the bishop to allow you to start a saint cult. Find the dream location for your character's house right next to a waterfall. Ensure your character's happy marriage. Pick the sex of the children. Plant a tree.<br/><br/>I'll emphasize that if the above options seem like they would undermine challengeful play, then you're probably reading something into them that I did not intend. My biggest issue with meta-points like this is precisely in how to make them something fun and worthwhile without actually having them affect events of play, because I don't want players to substitute good wargaming with GM-asskissing [grin]. I'd be comfortable with using meta points for everything else, which basically means using them to give players more sway over "what scenario are we playing now, precisely".<br/><br/>About improved stat rolls with meta points: I'm not against it, but I recommend making sure your math works out so that the returns on that are relatively petty and unguaranteed - you don't want a "pay to win" situation to develop. This works better in a high-lethality game, as the character with good stats isn't guaranteed to stick around, so there's some question of how much of your MP resource you'd want to blow on that one character. Personally I would probably just make it a "pay a point to reroll your whole stat line" thing, but this does obviously depend on everything else in the campaign.<br/><br/>One more idea: I'm not sure if this would be a good one or not, but I <i>might</i> decide that you lose a meta point for skipping a regular session. I like regular players after all, and this would encourage the players to spend their points before they're gone in the vagaries of everyday life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468621/#Comment_468621" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-26T22:30:27+00:00" title="December 26, 2017 10:30PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's lots of potential here, but I'm not sure I understand the particular combination of factors you're putting together:<br/><br/>* The game is one where the players compete to overcome challenges.<br/>* You can get points by sabotaging those attempts.<br/>* In return, your (future) characters may be better able to compete.<br/><br/>I could see that going really well if the game was structured so that people were interested in doing this when the characters were doing well, but not interested in doing it when the characters are doing poorly. However, your particular formulation doesn't seem to do that, to me.<br/><br/>Either the rewards are substantial, in which case the incentive for working against the rest of the group is overly strong (you might create a game where there is a LOT of this kind of behaviour), or the rewards are very minor, in which case it becomes a form of social approval for keeping the game interesting and playing your character in ways which are not optimal. <br/><br/>I like the latter more than the former.<br/><br/>Eero's "game maintenance" and "special privileges" version makes more sense to me, because otherwise it looks like you potentially muddy the creative agenda of your game with rewards for working against that very creative agenda.<br/><br/>Or am I missing something? Is there a way in which "play my character as a traitor" actually ties into trying to win the dungeon crawl or challenge-based adventure?<br/><br/>Here's an interesting sort of "halfway measure", in a few examples:<br/><br/>* The GM can flag some complications for the characters as being sources of MPs. <br/><br/>For instance, if you fail a saving throw against an intelligent magic item, perhaps the GM can now tell you that you gain MPs whenever you let the item influence your behaviour.<br/><br/>This could create some fruitful ways to influence characters in the game without entirely undercutting the creative agenda.<br/><br/>* The PCs can "bail out" a failed adventure by engaging in some of these "fun" behaviours. <br/><br/>When thinks go bad, and success seems unlikely, a character, a player, or even the whole group can attempt to do some of these "fun" things in exchange for some kind of bennies.<br/><br/>Ideally, the "bennies" give them a better chance of succeeding in the venture, but not reliably so. <br/><br/>You may end up with a situation like one of these:<br/><br/>* Some crazy stuff happened, someone betrayed the party, another person gave in to the influence of their Magic Ring... and it allowed the party to succeed in the adventure, after all.<br/><br/>* Same thing, but only one or two characters had to "take the blame", and died. Their players are rewarded in the form of leftover bennies/MPs to spend on their next characters. The rest succeeded!<br/><br/>* Same thing, but it is a failure. The PCs gambled and lost: many people died, the adventure is a total loss. However, leftover bennies/MPs were scored, so the new characters who will replace the TPKed party will be more fun or flavourful.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468622/#Comment_468622" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-26T22:35:43+00:00" title="December 26, 2017 10:35PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Given the context being discussed (an OSR/challenge-based adventuring), what does more democratic apportioning of XP look like?

Old school D&amp;D runs much smoother and is more fun if the players <i>all</i> are eager and serious about wargaming the situations that come up in play - by which I mean, eager and serious about paying attention to detail and figuring out how things should work.<br/><br/>The way I deal with this myself is that I talk about it with the players, and I commend them as they improve on their play: I thank players who tell me that their characters are too encumbered to swim when thrown into water, to pick an example of this sort of accountability. Martin is not suggesting that players should sabotage their play, he's suggesting that players might find it easier to get clued in about how to play correctly if they got a nominal (ultimately meaningless) reward for it.<br/><br/>One of the biggest cultural poisons in the D&amp;D scene is the idea that the players are there to get away with petty selfishness, while the GM is the daddy figure whose responsibility it is to micromanage the physics simulation because he can't trust the players to "game" anything in the wargaming sense. (That is, simulate without bias.) I for one refuse to do that shit; if you want to cheat with the dice, cheat with the encumbrance calculations, pay too little for equipment purchases, conveniently ignore your character's religious convictions when it suits you, and so on, I'm not there to save you from yourself: you're a shitty player, and not likely to rise to high stature in a healthy campaign.<br/><br/>This is the context in which I understood Martin: he's looking to communicate expectations of good sportsmanship with token rewards, presumably because he trusts explicit mechanics to be a stronger rhetorical position than it'd be if the GM simply encouraged the other players to play better. It's precisely the same logic as Fan Mail.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that I would not expect players to invent "character flaws" out of thin air to justify MP rewards during play. If they did, the points economy would be clearly much too biased towards MPs being actually desirable instead of merely decorative. Shouldn't work in practice, anyway; presumably you'd only get MPs for genuinely compelling and well-founded exercises in self-sabotage, rather than any old stupidity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468625/#Comment_468625" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-26T23:00:11+00:00" title="December 26, 2017 11:00PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Given the context being discussed (an OSR/challenge-based adventuring), what does more democratic apportioning of XP look like?

The players need to be able to challenge judgements when they disagree with the GM. The group collectively needs to maintain respect and belief in the legitimacy of the scoring (which implies that any serious challenge to the legitimacy <i>has</i> to be addressed before play continues).<br/><br/>I consider the above to be requirements for a well-run democratic D&amp;D table. It is in no way a given that a D&amp;D campaign would fulfill them. It is easy to imagine a campaign in which e.g. the GM tells you how much you gained after the adventure, and that's that - no calculations, justifications or review. The GM may still be consistent and have other good judgement virtues, but that system is <i>not</i> democratic in any meaningful procedural sense.<br/><br/>As you know, I apply quest rewards in addition to treasure XP in my GMing, as a generalization of the treasure rule. (Philosophically speaking it's not the treasure that gets you XP, but rather the completed objective - the treasure is just a way to calculate how much to give.) Due to this more generalized context it is necessary for players to "call their objectives" in advance, for how else could we know whether they've actually achieved a quest or not. This call-in stage is generally where we hash out the specifics of how the xp reward is to be calculated, and so on. The system is largely contractual (the other players contract with the GM to undertake an adventure in exchange for XP upon successful completion, however that is defined), but that's just me - you could do it in other ways, too.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>XP in an OSR context has a beautiful clarity anyway (particularly in 1 coin = 1 XP style rules), so I'm curious how that can be rendered any more democratically.</p></div></blockquote>\nThat rule is a great help, yes. It helps make most scoring scenarios very easy to adjudicate as long as quest goal is "get rich or die trying".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468628/#Comment_468628" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-27T03:25:16+00:00" title="December 27, 2017  3:25AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Given that interpretation, I agree entirely! <br/><br/>I think I had been reading a little into the discussion here - jumping from "being a traitor to the party" to "democratic rewards, a la Fan Mail" to "GMing an OSR game" made me wonder what exactly was being suggested.<br/><br/>That makes a ton of sense - I agree with this approach in every particular, and hearing a bit about how it works in your campaign is always great fun! <br/><br/>Thanks for the thorough response.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468630/#Comment_468630" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-27T10:55:30+00:00" title="December 27, 2017 10:55AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the thoughtful discussion thus far. Eero has done a pretty good job at answering Paul's questions on my behalf. The key, as he says, is giving fictional positioning more mechanical weight in the realm of player motivations.<br/><br/>My players are not attempting to "win" in an abstract sense. They are trying to win by having *these* characters succeed at *this* challenge in *this* situation - that's a huge strength of OSR: The tangible world. When one of them can't understand Elvish, they try and make decisions as though they aren't following the conversation the party are having with the NPC.<br/><br/>And when one of them has a cursed magic item that's whispering dark secrets in their ear, they want to RP that faithfully - because otherwise they are ignoring the fictional positioning and have stopped playing OSR. On the other hand, they also want to win, and these two forces are in opposition.<br/><br/>My goal is to give enough of a mechanical reward here that it helps the players to do what they already know is the "right" thing to do: To play the downfall of their character with flair.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I'm so convinced that these are only token rewards as Eero says. I certainly agree that they are not worth losing characters for: This is meant to be a bad trade, forced by the fictional positioning, just as choosing to take HP damage in exchange for defeating a monster in melee is the bad trade forced by the fictional positioning of being ambushed.<br/><br/>But I would like the rewards to have some weight - some hope for a better, brighter future for the next PC. (And, of course, the reward for really skilful party play, is for one player to play "cursed and mind-controlled" as hard as they can, and the rest of the party to manage to free them from the mind control. That way MP are earned *and* the party lives to fight another day.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
