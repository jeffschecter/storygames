While Nyarlie had a good initial run in the first half of his century-long term (two world wars and the development of nuclear armaments by humanity were big feathers in his cap), the second half of his term wasn\u2019t nearly so successful. His Wicked, Scary Monsters Party\u2019s (WSMP) promise to plunge the world into chaos, horror, and ruin on Jan 1, 2000 failed to materialize, and the citizens of the monster community have lost confidence in his party\u2019s capabilities. As is tradition, the election season will begin on May 1 and proceed through the summer, culminating with election night, October 31, when the next occupant of the Goblin Throne for the 21st century will be decided.<br/><br/>The remaining party faithful of the WSMP are busy trying to figure out how to regain the throne and present a new vision of the party. Opposition Parties are forming, but are fragmented with a variety of visions for the future. Most disturbingly, the liberal No Eat-ems Party seems to be making headway in organizing. The NEEP believes that a more sustainable future that doesn\u2019t involve the general massacre and/or consumption of humanity is desirable, and is backed by enough Hollywood money to get their message out. If the NEEPs win, it will represent a huge direction shift in Monster-town politics.<br/><br/>And, of course, there are any number of splinter factions of each of the two big parties, as well as charismatic individuals and single issue parties cropping up (especially those having an interest in more local Monster-town issues than Monstro-Human Relations).</i><br/>______<br/><br/>What I need are ideas for political platforms and interest groups for the game. The follow-up post gives the factions that will be represented by minis. Right now, I'm not looking for any mechanical help, just general ideas.<br/><br/>I have no idea right now which monster will be picked by any player as their "candidate", nor how many players will participate, although hopefully less than ten players (with possibly a referee or two). In addition to voting bloc interests, i'm looking for particular resources a given voting bloc might provide to a candidate or a party boss.<br/><br/><br/>*"Minis Spectacular" is my new jargon of choice for these kinds of games. few folks have heard of braunstein in any case, nad i wanted to put the idea of minis usage squarely up front in the concept.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211410/#Comment_211410" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T13:20:24+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  1:20PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The factions:<br/>Dracula and his 3 Brides<br/>The Mummy<br/>Frankenstein and Igor<br/>The Frankenstein Monster<br/>Ghouls (6)<br/>Fish-men (6)<br/>Skeleton Pirates (6)<br/>A huge Bunch of Zombies (I dunno-50ish?)<br/>Werewolves (4)<br/>Werewolf Bikers (2)<br/>Nosferatu (4)<br/>Vampire Children (6-8)<br/>Cthulhu, possibly Nyarlathotep as well<br/>A pair of Witches<br/>Some Ghosts (3-4)<br/>A bunch of familiars and jack-o-lanterns (24ish?)<br/>Scarecrows (6)<br/>The Headless Horseman<br/>Pagan leftovers (like The Horned King) (3-4)<br/>\n<blockquote>For these guys, I'm trying to figure out stuff like Paul Beakley suggested in the thread linked above:<br/>For each character, create the following:<br/><br/>* Is naturally allied with _______ (insert name/description of another character) because __________<br/><br/>* Is potentially allied with __________ because __________<br/><br/>* Is naturally opposed by __________ because __________<br/><br/>Each character is potentially opposed by *any* other character of course.<br/><br/>For each character{ or faction/subfaction}, create the following:<br/><br/>* Primary objective (worth the most VPs)<br/><br/>* 2-3 secondary objectives (worth either VPs, or unlocks additional resources midgame, i.e. "read the tome in the church and gain +3 zombie miniatures")<br/><br/>For each objective, consider how *other* characters may relate to the objective.</blockquote>\n<br/>Possible Wild cards/non-monsters<br/>Cats (12)<br/>A bunch of modern humans (including reporters and kids) (10-12)<br/>Holmes and Watson<br/>Other Mad Scientist/Inventor types<br/>A witch-doctor/shaman type dude<br/>Yeti or two<br/>Alleister Crowley and the Scarlet Woman<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure what to do with therse guys, but ideas are appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211413/#Comment_211413" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T13:37:13+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  1:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frankenstein and Igor -- clearly a technocratic faction.
