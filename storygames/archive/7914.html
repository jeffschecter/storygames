We're thinking about something along the lines of Final Fantasy, Escaflowne, Full Metal Alchemist etc.   Anyway, this is a pretty different sort of game for us, and I\u2019m a bit nervous about things crashing and burning.  I guess I\u2019m most concerned about the GMless aspect of the game, and while we\u2019re good at riffing on each other\u2019s ideas I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll just come to a grinding halt because we\u2019ll run out of ideas or get bogged down in boring no-conflict situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game system we\u2019ll be using is a Gmless rules hack of Rob Donoghue\u2019s Wheel of Fate that I\u2019ve been playing around with, but I also stole liberally from Polaris and PTA in regards to how the GMing duties and scene framing might work.  In order to better facilitate on the fly NPCs now all the characters in the game have a single attribute called Dominion which is rated from 1d6 to 6d6 (can\u2019t get much simpler than that).  PCs start with a rating of 4d6, but they also have Pools and Aspects which remain the same as WoF.  Certain primary NPCs would also have Pools and Aspects, but most NPCs will ONLY have a Dominion rating.  Dominion is also equal to how much Stress a character can take.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I\u2019m looking for sage advice on things we might watch out for.  We\u2019re all enthusiastic noobs when it comes to story games although I\u2019ve been lurking on forums and buying these sorts of games for almost a year now.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory Gamers I Summon You!<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175296/#Comment_175296" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T09:33:04+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  9:33AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2008 1:37AM by Kropotkin.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're probable right about using an established system whole cloth (maybe something like Universalis), but this is an experiment in more ways than one for us.  I'm also addicted to hacking games. . .<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving intertwined stories that occasionally connect would be fine with our group although it doesn't exactly feel like Final Fantasy with its more traditional rpg "we're a party of adventurers saving the world" thing.  It occurs to me not having the characters forced to be together does free us up to do different stuff.  Like say if I wanted to do the Char Aznable like hero-in-villains-clothing thing that would be possible with this type of play and would be harder to pull off in a more traditionally structured game (assuming the rest of the players were playing more party-centric heroic types).  The relentless justification of partying can get tired after a while so this isn't really a bad thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175410/#Comment_175410" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-18T21:35:12+00:00" title="October 18, 2008  9:35PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This basic idea from Prime Time Adventures seems to work:<br/><br/>Just make everyone take turns framing scenes.<br/>Start with the guy on your right and sort of clue players in, at the start of each scene, who's turn it is to frame a scene next.<br/><br/>The players will treat whoever has the most rules knowledge (ie you) as if that person was the GM, anyway, until they get comfortable with the system.<br/>Just tell them everyone has to frame a scene. That's the rules.<br/><br/>Players are generally bright enough to get into the spirit, once they realize they're free. If everyone has their avatars and the avatars have some reason to form a cohesive group, most people are smart enough to focus on what happens to that group.<br/><br/>But, yeah, they're gonna split up. That's fine. With the opportunity to step in as an NPC or rate eachothers' performances, no one should really be left out for too long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_175414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175414/#Comment_175414" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-18T22:16:20+00:00" title="October 18, 2008 10:16PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A GM'less game is far better suited to play with split groups of PCs.

Here's how I'm imagining it will work:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe protagonist player frames the scene and begins by establishing what they are doing, where they are, who's there etc.  Another player plays the antagonist to the protagonist and they are responsible for introducing conflicts and playing most of the forces/NPCs who oppose the protagonist.  The third player is responsible for playing any of the protagonist's connections, allies, or other sundry NPCs, and the third player will also (when necessary) adjudicate conflicts between the protagonist and antagonist.  This is essentially the way Polaris works with three players as I understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175649/#Comment_175649" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-21T01:34:29+00:00" title="October 21, 2008  1:34AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'll be doing setting creation and character generation tonight.

We're meeting again next week to do that.  We'll also be tweaking a bit of the setting as there was a consensus that we needed to define a few more elements.  What seemed to be missing was a strong situation for us to plug characters into.  We might just need to draw the elements we did come up with more closely together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we're all liking the elements we came up with though: alchemical technology in place of steam technology, elemental magic firearms, a cold war between two imperialist nations, constitutional monarchy vs. autocracy, secret societies whose immortality experiments have wounded the world's "soul", a King who was recently murdered by said secret society, a poisonous flower which turns people exposed to it into zombies etc.  It feels a bit to me like the world in Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle combined with a few other things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
