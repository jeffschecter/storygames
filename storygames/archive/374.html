                    This is the place I'll use on this forum to cover my design log and progress, as well as post any questions I have.<br/><br/>Right now the Alpha version is complete and I am writing the Beta version.<br/><br/>This game revolves about the following ideas/principles:<br/><br/>1. Drive up tension between the different players.<br/><br/>2. The Triangle is a viable enough social form to have things not break up completely yet causes friction between participants.<br/><br/>3. Most of the action is inward, the game explores philosophical/theological memes. Even if they do not show in the actual text or gameplay. The action happens in a "Mindscape" of sorts.<br/><br/>4. The game is planned to have a finite end, ala DitV, Polaris, Under the Bed, Breaking the Ice, etc. The game has "Win" and "Lose" situations, which differ from win/lose for the characters and the players.<br/><br/>5. Each player plays a different aspect of the triangle forming up one of the PCs.<br/><br/>6. Elements <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> give this game a boardgame feel.<br/><br/>7. Simulation is thrown right out of the window.<br/><br/> I had a dream, where someone asked me what kind of fucked up person do you have to be to come up with such a game. The answer is, my kind of person. The self-questioning kind.<br/><br/>All comments are welcome.<br/><br/>Current information can be found <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=249713" rel="nofollow">Here</a>, from RPG.Net.                </div>

                            It all started on The Forge, in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18227.0" rel="nofollow">this Ronnies discussion</a>. I posted ideas twice, took one idea from each Ronnies session and did some brainstorming:<br/><br/>8/01/06<br/>Cranium Rats, to feature Rat and Mud, with the added element of Water. Flood and Rainbow scenes, flexibility, burrowing, mind control, artificial day cycles, dreams.<br/><br/>11/01/06<br/>Rats as Lemmings. Sinking Ship Rats. Bacteria and Single Cell creatures as Rats as Rats are to people. More mind control. Relation between Water and Rat. Triangular relations and non-relations.<br/><br/>At this point I had a recurring idea in my mind, when I actually thought of the Mechanics, not only for this game, but of RPGs in general. RPGs tend to not have less than 4 stats, Indie RPGs tend to have exactly four statistics.<br/>Why four? Four is a stable number, over four and you enter needless complexity and lose the edge and attention that each trait receives, less than 4 and you have traits that instead of supporting each other draw each other out, gang on the other.<br/><br/>Three is also an instable social form, and thus the current format was born. I'm an unabashed Gamist and in my Indie games I'm looking for Narrativism, which combined with the first sentence combined for a somewhat board-gamish feel later on.<br/><br/>Some of the material such as Bacteria and Sinking Ship rats will become background/colour material in the beta/finished versions, they're complete in my mind but I didn't find the need to include them in the Alpha besides mentioning them for random brainstorming reasons.<br/><br/>As you can see, the initial idea was for having actual "Cranium Rats", they enter bodies upon birth and control them, enter Equilibrium, 1984 and Paranoia. Burrowing and mind-control, what they make us do, how they survive, manipulate us. Water entered and later turned Mud into Dirt(Which can become "Mud" added Water).<br/><br/>Flood and Rainbow scenes, you see how I took to Water and combined it with my Jewish background. If there is such a conflict between the two, what is more fitting than the conflict/resolution scenes of utter conflict and promise of eternal peace?<br/><br/>More to follow later.                        </div>

                            Enter the third and fourth of March, 2006. I am doing a weekend shift at the army. A perfect opportunity to write a 24 hour RPG; albeit the fact that I am completely without my books or even internet. Just me and my creativity.<br/><br/>I begin with the triangle that you see in the file. I add things to it, a great many things, brainstorming wildly. Everything up to and including X and Y are Z was part of the triangle. I cut it off the triangle and put it in its current format after realizing what a pain in the ass it is to do it by graphics. I think it has more punch this way.<br/><br/>I thought of mechanics, of background, of random ideas. I will probably scan it later to show you what a mess I've written on one page and its back side. Example: "Rainbow Scene - Equilibrium. The following line(blank page, so "line") has "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flood Scene??</span> - Has something to do with water, also gives water more to do." Most of the Alpha is basically taking conflicting ideas from this page and making them work together, cutting off what doesn't work. Expanding one-line reasoning of mechanics into what is currently present.<br/><br/>The alpha took much time as the sheer amount of information on each page is huge, and it's condensed to boot. It's like looking at HoL the cliffnotes and then taking them apart.<br/>Much of it is because the game took hold of my mind, going to sleep at 0030 on Sunday proved pointless as every 20 minutes I had a "Zing!" moment and just had to jot down another idea.<br/><br/>I also scribbled down the sheet, knowing what it's going to look like is part of the game's "Name", same as a character needs its name, so does the game need its sheet. Mostly Triangles and some resulting Hexagrams(Seal of Solomon, Magen David, Shield of David).<br/><br/>Eventually I realized I don't care for the 24 hour RPG idea, I just needed the 24 hours limit in order to coerce myself into a spurt of activity, and once this spurt was done I've achieved my goal.<br/><br/>More to come later. And people, I'd be thankful if you'd post your thoughts over RPG.net.                        </div>

Yes, I know what is there right now is mostly an outline. Give it a day. Drafting and all that rot. Also, read Cranium Rats! Cool ideas are present.                        </div>

                            The file had undergone some revisions and can be found <a href="http://craniumrats.pbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>Thanks to Eric and Andrew for their input.<br/>All further changes will probably only occur for playtesters and as a result of playtest. This file will be available online for an unlimited amount of time.<br/><br/>List of changes, clarifications, fixing omissions:<br/>Sheet is crap, it's there as placeholder.<br/>Steal rule changed.<br/>Added option of stealing from Die Reservoir.<br/>Added the missing Aspect Ratios bit(Oops!).<br/>Updated Play Example to Beta, it is still relatively short, game lacks Examples in the rules. That is purposeful.<br/>Table of Contents inserted.<br/>Meta-Chanics placeholder inserted, will be given to playtesters after they've playtested the game for a bit on their own to compare notes.<br/>Added notes regarding Tokens and "No Character Death", mainly "Have fun, tell a good story. Don't. Be. Jerks."<br/>Expanded Glossary a bit.<br/>Added explanation of the 16th Dot, added a bit about there being 3 characters with 3 Aspects for each. People do not read my mind.<br/>Added Game Setup "Who?" section, on what kind of characters you can play, "Setting" in a way.<br/>Added Token gain for Enlightened.<br/>Added rule for losing a Die when you lose a Conflict, which can bring about a Flood Scene.                        </div>

I will consider your idea though.<br/>Andrew: *nods* Another possibility would be that a 1 can save dice from scene to scene, so that he or she may not act for a while and then throw a curve ball in there eventually.<br/>Guy: Hmm, or he gets to add Dice, every time he succeeds he keeps the dice, till he fails and it resets.<br/>Andrew: *nods*<br/>Guy: Note though that need some seperation between real-world tests and bidding tests.<br/>Andrew: Have you ever considered using 4 characters and shifting the role of enlightened as well as the aspects?<br/>Guy: Yes. Want to know why I shy away from it?<br/>Andrew: Sure. Also there is a problem with a rule balancing<br/>Andrew: Why spend 2 dice to give a person another die when they are bidding, instead of stealing one die from their opponent?<br/>Guy: The Triangle is an instable form, even on a social format, that's why I use a triangular relation system. I want the game to happen, to occur, when competition increases you need someone to be impartial, need the game to use a square, with one set point, to have it work on the real world level.<br/>Guy: If you're stealing then you're participating, adding is for those on the sidelines.<br/>Andrew: Sidelines can't steal?<br/>Guy: You have no dice pool. What use will stealing give you? You don't steal to the Reservoir, but to the pool.<br/>Andrew: It adds one to you reservoir. page 12.<br/>Guy: Right.<br/>Andrew: So, on the sidelines you should steal not add to better yourself.<br/>Guy: 1, you can also steal Dice that are being bidded, to a minimum of 1, limiting how much you can steal.<br/>Guy: Assume we have Rat 4, Dirt 4, Water 8.<br/>Guy: If we're having Rat Vs. Water then Dirt will better help Rat, because they need to stop Water.<br/>Guy: Stealing from Water is less likely to help.<br/>Guy: You want to help Rat.<br/>Andrew: Why? If they're both 2 for 1. I'd better myself.<br/>Guy: You don't better yourself. But you're right, I did think of it, need to rework it. You're paying 2 and gaining 1, end result is still better, you're right.<br/>Andrew: Why not remove the stealing and instead allow tokens to let you steal?<br/>Guy: Maybe helping is 2 for 1 or 3 for 2. Hmm. Token+Die, spend 1 Die, give the person you steal from 1 Token, steal?<br/>Andrew: I was thinking about spending a token to subtract one die from their pool and add it to your resevoir.<br/>Guy: I know.<br/>Andrew: You could give 2 dice from your res to add 1 to their pool, or spend 1 token to add one die to your pool (used when making a non-bidding action.)<br/>Guy: Note you can also help at the rate of 1 Token per die, once again we're left with no reason to help(aside from in real world situations).<br/>Andrew: *nods* If the character dies does all three aspects lose?<br/>[06:50] Guy: Well, a character dies by reaching any Trait at 0. Which can't happen so long as not all Aspects are at 1. In which case Trait going to 0 results in Aspect 0. And game end.<br/>Andrew: Hrm.                        </div>

                            Guy: I did say I'm throwing Simulationism(real world) out, it's all about the mini-games and the narrative.<br/>Andrew: So what if the PC gets shot? He survives and wakes up in the hospital?<br/>Guy: Does it make sense though? Steal being Token+1 die?<br/>Andrew: Yes<br/>Guy: Narration is by the people. He gets shot at, dives and hits his head, he gets shot at the leg....<br/>Andrew: What if someone narrates his death (the enlighted, let's say). Or an aspect who is about to lose, anyways.<br/>Guy: That's going against the game fun. There is no such option.<br/>Andrew: So to keep the others from winning, he kills the character.<br/>Guy: We're assuming people aren't jerks. But I'll also add this in later on.<br/>Andrew: Big assumption, because someone can threaten to kill the character if he wins narration rights and forces the other two to use up most of their res, so that he can undercut them later ;P<br/>Guy: I'll add it in. Besides, this game requires maturity, as you can see from how it does things.<br/>Andrew: *nods* It's underhanded, but you seem to imply that people should play for the win.<br/>Guy: Besides, the Resources are of limited time, so they give them up, then they have more. Not at the expanse of player fun.<br/>Guy: Also, note the interesting Token minigame, if you're stealing from someone and you're giving him one of his own Tokens, he doesn't really get a Token, you give him someone else's, he has another Token, you give him one of yours, he can later return it to you...<br/>Andrew: oh btw, no comma before yet at the bottom of page 13<br/>Guy: Ah, it's there on purpose. Like saying, "It's like this, unless you want it different!"<br/>Andrew: It is grammatically incorrect.<br/>Guy: I'm not bothered by it right now. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Andrew: Do me a favor define things before you talk about them. What is an unclaimed region?<br/>Guy: You have the Aspects, Dots not claimed by any are put in the "Unclaimed Region", unclaimed but not lost.<br/>Andrew: ok, 15 starting dots? 5 for everyone? or was it 16?<br/> Andrew: I'm unsure.<br/>Guy: You begin with 5 for everyone, and immediately afterwards a bidding for the 16th dot begins. Only those on the road to enlightenment have the 16th dot, which pushes things out of balance.<br/>Andrew: at the top of 15<br/>Andrew: These games seem like they can go for a long time.<br/>Guy: Look at Glossary on Aspects.<br/>Guy: Yes, they can, note that Zoom-in will cause things to move much faster.,<br/>Guy: Since suddenly you have multiple rolls per scene.<br/>Andrew: I would perfer you rename Zoom-in. It's confusing. I'd even go as far as to call it, "Action."<br/>Guy: I know, didn't have anything else on my mind at the time.<br/>Andrew: Spend a token, take Action. kinda like in shooting a film.<br/>Guy: We can also call it "Mess it up" like in Guy Ritchie films, where things go down in a basket.<br/>Andrew: or "Roll". though that may be confusing with dice.<br/>Guy: Initiate rock and roll <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>Guy: See, that's what you're here for, to make me understand it's unclear there's this 16th dot going on, and shit.<br/>Andrew: Yeah, its a cool feature. While your brevity is nice, it also harms you because things aren't clear. (in some instances)<br/>Andrew: Might I also suggest you number each group of rules (1,2,3 etc.) and each bullet gets replaced with a letter. Then you could refer to rule 2a or rule 5b<br/>Guy: Or "Third bullet in group 3". I'll organize it later, while I'll add the char sheet, bibliography and a new example of play.<br/>Andrew: 3c is quicker to say<br/>Andrew: Why would the enlightened spend tokens?<br/>Andrew: You say you give tokens to the Enlightened. You say they're removed if he spends them. Why would he?<br/>Guy: The Enlightened is also a player, if he doesn't use his Tokens, they're useless, they erase at every game session. Read the part where Tokens get refreshed each session. If he wants to gain more control over the story then he has to spend Tokens, if he thinks a player is doing something cool and wants to see them succeed, he can help, or help the opposition, he can create Goals for Aspects, etc.<br/>Andrew: If he is a player, then he is not neutral. You lose your triangle.<br/>Guy: No. He's a player of a game. He doesn't play an Aspect, he's neutral to the Aspect. He is a player as in a participant of the story being created. If he thinks something would help the story, he should help it happen.<br/>Guy: He's not just sitting there, dammit.<br/>Andrew: *nods* I dunno.<br/>Guy: I dunno what?<br/>Andrew: About the Enlightened.<br/>Andrew: The Magician thing is interesting. You know what might be a cool twist?<br/>Andrew: Magicians enter a dreamstate where they have those powers-- basically, while enlightened they live in a waking dream that they control. Perhaps they get knocked into a coma when they get enlightened, only to wake up when they fall out of balance again.<br/>Guy: Note the section about Endgame, where it doesn't say what Enlightenment is, it's a solipsist game, they're only halfway there, but they CHOOSE to stay behind, they choose to not be enlightened. Like in Masters of the Art, once they reach High Arete they get trapped in power politics and lose sight of ascension.<br/>Andrew: I have another idea. When someone becomes a Magician, that is when the Enlightened learns that the aspects exist. The GM (the Enlightened) now can bid like the players. He always will have a 5 for his trait. If the Magician slips out of his state, he automatically lose 1 trait. Now the Enlightened can only go down (to 0), if someone takes a dot from him then the non-prominent (bidding occurs if the prominent takes the dot between the other two aspects) aspect that did not gain a dot loses one. (Thus eventually perserving the 16 as the Enlightened's score drops to 0)<br/>Guy: You're really not familiar with Indy games, sure you can modify them, they give themselves to modification, however, what is in them, is there to engender a certain feel. They're very modifiable in order to be able to get your feel, but they come with a feel packaged.<br/>Guy: Dude, most games won't have Magicians. For a Magician to exist, you must have a tie on the beginning roll of the game. Which is rare in itself.<br/>Andrew: Indeed.<br/>Guy: The Enlightened was like a PC before, and is now Enlightened, of course he knows of the Aspects, that's what being Enlightened means. Read "Legends of the World" again. Also, that makes The Enlightened competitive.<br/>Andrew: So he learns the Legends when he knows that?<br/>Guy: It stops being the same game, at all.<br/>Guy: Read the Legend, it means what it says.<br/>Andrew: Yes, it does. The game is thrown into disarray-- it becomes chaotic.<br/>Guy: That is not my goal. The reason the game has a fourth person is to maintain game-order, out of game-order. What you suggest is fine, so long you're aware it's another game.<br/>Andrew: *nods* The state of enlightenment is balance, is it not? A fourth corner could instigate instability, though-- it would be a scene. The magician now has three voices in his head he not only listens to, but bargains with. The enlightened would be a represenation of the external character looking inward and through that and that which is drescribed in the Legends he has such powers. (I'm just throwing this out here in hopes there might be some decent ideas)<br/>Guy: Hm. The Enlightened is beyond balance. He's One. He's None. He may have Ascended to Nirvana, out of the lie called Reality, he may have become part of reality, he may have taken the following path, which is essentially what the "GM" did, he become "God", or a god, he starts dictating facts in the lie, he may have got the Solipsist enlightenment, he figured only he exists, and now exists(?) alone, or figured everything else is a figment of his imagination, which he's now fabricating. How does the world handle multiple Enlightenments is also unclear. It depends on the Character's Cosmology, the Water Aspect and anything else.<br/>Andrew: *nods*<br/>Guy: I'm giving you bits, contradictory bits, and let you design your cosmology, and the players design theirs, and the characters'...                        </div>

                            Discussion with Eric Bennett, the other lead to the revisions in the Beta, mostly in terms of feel and clarifications:<br/>This will also be broken into two posts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eric: Ah, yes. Well, on a superficial level (to start off), where did you get the Rat/Dirt/Water trio from? I understand what they represent, and think they do so in a very intuitive way, but I'm curious why you picked 'em. :-)<br/>Guy: Well, Mud and Rat came from the Ronnies, as you can see from the general design log, then I added Water, I then thought. Shit, isn't Mud basically Dirt+Water? And thus we got Dirt. Mud and Rat came from us being made from "clay" and the Rat burrowing in. Rats also come in part from Pratchett, where I have the image of rats as infective emotions.<br/>Eric: Ahh, I see. I asked because they seemed to represent terms that could have easily been spoken of with plainer words, and the choice of them seemed to "load" things in a way that made the idea interestng.<br/>Guy: I like loaded things.<br/>Guy: If you'd have read my LJ you'd have seen how I use symbology and words like that.<br/>Eric: Ah, yes. Reading your actual play, where the players propose the way they would drive the character to act in the situation mixed with a bit of Resident Evil: Outbreak I was playing yesterday to bring about this idea/question: Running the game in such a way that the same situation is played through (wether simply through ooc fiat or through some in-setting mechanism) but with each player rotating their position on the Rat/Dirt/Water triangle? The line..Michael: I have Paul do nothing, considering he's the type who sits in the background and<br/> does nothing. I think the best thing would be for him to stand in the background, not<br/> attracting attention.<br/> Guy: I could have him run away out of fear, but fuck that shit, Daphne is here, this is my<br/> chance, this is my day. I'm going to have him jump over Grizzly bear and take his gun<br/> away!<br/>Anyway, the question is about setting up the game to do that. I'm still digesting the game a bit, but from what I think I grasp of it the game would be really cool framed like that to explore the players, rather than the character in question. I'm not really sure if that makes a good question or not, but I think if I can gather my playtest slaves for such a thing, that it would be an excellent evening's gaming. ^_^;; Sorry for the vague nature there.<br/>Guy: It's possible, but it's not necessary. You don't need to see each player's views on each situation through each Aspect, especially as players after the first are influenced by what the first set did. You have three Characters, the three players play all three Aspects, a different one for each character, so you can see how they act for the Aspect in the appropriate character!<br/>Eric: *checks the pdf* Ah, is this a new idea? Because I like it, and it does seem to move away from risking that the second set of Aspects will act like the first. <br/>Guy: Besides, if you want to create sympathy and care between Aspect and Player, you need to keep them coupled, if you had switching chairs on Settlers of Cattan no one would care about winning as much.<br/>Guy: No, it's always been there. I don't know how, but people keep thinking there is only one character and three aspects.<br/>Eric: *grins* Which page is it on? <br/>Guy: Hmm, it's not specificied directly.... I'll make it clearer, but look here: (Link: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19160.msg201025#msg201025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19160.msg201025#msg201025</a>)<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19160.msg201025#msg201025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19160.msg201025#msg201025</a>. :: edits the portion about Character Generation to make it clear...::<br/>Eric: Oh, cool. Yeah, that didn't seem to come out in the rules. <br/>Guy: Does this make the game seem actually cooler?<br/>Eric: Yes. Sorting the players out different ways for different characters, in the same game (not, for example, like running different shows altogether in PTA or something)...that feels much more, well I'm not sure "punchy" is the right word for it, but it makes the game more appealing, yes. *shrugs* Gut reaction and all that.  (Ah, I think I utterly glossed over the scene setting section, where it makes the multiple characters thing pretty explicit)<br/>Guy: What did you think/make of The Legends. Anyway, edited the file to make it all that clearer.<br/>Eric: The Fall had a cool take on the old myth, the World doesn't have as much "hey, that is a neat take on things" as the Fall or the Child, though it does bring to mind this semi-creepy imagery of somebody reading a flyer or somesuch when they start hearing these voices talking to them and each other in his head. I'm not sure if that is what you intended, but it has that kind of surreal quality to it, when run through my mental filters.<br/>Guy: And The Moon?<br/>Eric: The Child is just great. I think its the best of the three in terms of making things clear about how things might be played out, as well as just being plain creepy. As for the Moon.<br/>Guy: The Play Example also shows at the end that there are multiple PCs.<br/>Eric: Looked at one way, it feels a bit weaker than the other three, but looked at another way (the drive to survive urging people out of desperate situations and into the unknown) it makes me want to play Lovecraft with it. <br/>Guy: Legends of the Child's last two lines are Anansi Boys influenced for the simpletons, or merely folk-tale influenced for those who know more.<br/>Guy: Ah, it also shows you the relation between Rat and Water, and that things aren't as they seem. Rat is instinct, but look where it gets you afar from shore <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>. And yes, the light and ocean of darkness give certain Lovecraft vibes.<br/>Eric: *nods* Gotcha. I think I am going to be, depending on who I playtest this with, running a "folks who get eaten by the Mythos" thing, where two characters are different investigators and the third is the Horrible Cultist, or...zombies. <br/>Guy: Consider this, for I did. You can have one Character be a soldier in WW2, a second being his grandson, a security guard in a mall, and the third being a random who knows. The thing is, all three characters should cross-paths, if not go along. <br/>You can even have one character be a Hyrborean Conan, the second being the "Author" writing him, the third being the author's successful cousin. That'd give your players a shake-through about the nature of Reality.Combine that set-up with The World and watch their eyes light up <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>Eric: Might I suggest that you highlight the possiblity of taking that sort of angle? Little sidebars or something with different takes on how to distribute the three characters?<br/>Guy: I will, after writing influences/Play Examples, as this sort of things belong there.<br/>Eric: I think one of the best things Cranium Rats has going for it, by the way, is that it opens up a kind of story you don't often get to tell in a group setting. That being, all those ones which tend to focus on "first person" style tales.<br/>Guy: I added Repeat the above for each Character. You have one Rat, Water and Dirt per player, each Character has all three Aspects. <br/> For example:  <br/> Players are P1, P2, P3.<br/> Characters are C1, C2, C3, each has (W)ater, (R)at and (D)irt.<br/> P1 is W, C1; R, C2; D, C3.<br/> P2 is W, C2; R, C3; D, C1.<br/> P3 is W, C3; R, C1; D, C2.<br/> An Aspect belongs to one player.<br/>To the end of the Character Generation section.<br/>Guy: What about the Gamist fun? :P I want people to get a Munchkin or Settlers of Cattan feel! I want them going for the other players' throats!<br/>Eric: *hasn't played Settlers, but has heard much of it* If you want them going for each others throats...well, I will be doing it by playing up the madness angle for the Lovecraft and zombies thing. Conflicting urges and all that. Oh! And I have nowhere near anyone who would play such a game, but I can also see a very amusing "Day in the Life of a High School Student" thing. Two characters are students from different cliques, the third is a teacher...<br/>Eric: *grins* I suppose an excellent compliment on the work is that it fuels such a variety of stories...hell, Indigo Prophecy would fit in there rather decently, on the Lovecraft angle.<br/>Guy: Well, I want players going at throats, not characters. Look at how I set it up, there's a finite pool of Aspect Dots, you can only go up by taking others' dice, you're bidding them for narration, all resources...                        </div>

                            Eric: *nods* Sorry, I wasn't clear on that. I meant, the drives within one character conflicting over what to do with their Knowledge Not Meant To Be Known, sort of thing. Inner turmoil, you know what I mean?<br/>Eric: *ponders how to work Enlightenment into a zombie game* Mayhap call it Escape. Fate doesn't let you out of  unless you manage to be a decent person. <br/>Guy: I didn't define Enlightenment over. Combined with the meaning of Solipsism that I didn't cover, it leaves much space for thoughts in.<br/>Eric: Do you mean that Enlightenment shouldn't be defined by the game, or that it should only defined when it is reached?<br/>Guy: It should be defined when it reached, by the Water player. Read "Game End" again. You can give them your Cosmology HINTS, don't say "This is So!", there's a reason I call it "Legends of" and put contradictory little bits in. They decide what it is, not you.<br/>Eric: *nods* I was waffling between reading that as "decide when you get there" or "decide based on the character". <br/>Guy: By the way, if you want to know what kind of person can come up with Cranium Rats, then the answer is as follows: Someone whose inner mind works something like this, and whom the Gamist feel exists between himself and his siblings.<br/>Eric: Aha! Sibilings...now there would be a great party game angle...<br/>Guy: Except it's a bit tough, as they cross-over all the time, unless you have them meet say, three times a day, during lunches. Sister A gets mugged, tells older brother during dinner.<br/>Eric: Get four people together, they do each other up as characters (with the Englightened being whoever the character being played in based on) and game with that. It would need some modification, to tell the truth.<br/>Guy: Older brother goes out and beats muggers. Younger brothers sees this and decides to run away, sure he's next!(Such a rat thought...)<br/>Guy: Also, I suggest The Enlightened is kept as the same person!<br/>Eric: I know, which is why that would be very difficult/impossible to do, but I was just saying the thought occured.<br/>Guy: If things become too competitive you can't trust others to be neutral. Triangle is unstable, The Enlightened forms an OOC Square, a more stable form. Well, be careful, not having a permanent Enlightened, especially with controlling your other friends, and acting as if you know what drives them, will surely end badly.<br/>Eric: *chuckles* As all party games do. Which is why you play Roach, where it should end in a horrible fate for all mankind. I'll probably only be able to get to do the Lovecraft/zombies angles, considering who I have access to for players.<br/>Guy: I mean end badly OOCly.<br/>Eric: I know what you meant. I've had that kind of experience with just about every such game I've tried to play with folks in the hall.<br/>Guy: How would your friend act if you have his person rape someone in-game, if you describe him as weak-willed, or whatever?<br/>Eric: I don't know. I don't have te kinds of friends I could do that with...though to be honest none of them would pull something like that in the first place. Consider my suggesting retracted, in light of my forgetting how awful people can be to each other at the table.<br/>Guy: You control the WHY he does why he does, that's even more powerful than WHAT. You can say he slept with a total ho, sure, but saying he did it because he wants to hurt women? Now that's much more powerful. If you do it with an imagined character, that's damn powerful, DitV level, if you do it with your friend, it's like you punched him in the teeth.<br/>Eric: *nods* Actually, that angle reminds me quite a bit of Sailor Nothing. Have you ever read it? Its one of the best web-based pieces of fiction I've read in a good while. It is a take on the magical girl genre, using most of the same tropes, but what the author does with it, how they explain the obligatory invading empire, how the protagonists powers function, and how truly fucked up the characters are make it rather powerful. I've got a link hereabouts...<br/>Eric: (Link: <a href="http://www.pixelscapes.com/sailornothing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.pixelscapes.com/sailornothing/</a>)<a href="http://www.pixelscapes.com/sailornothing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.pixelscapes.com/sailornothing/</a> The reason it reminds me of that is due to the multiple character angle, and the focus on what goes on inside the characters' heads. That, and because both are very cool.<br/>Eric: *nods* I know what you mean. But...I think there really is a big difference between thinking the game is about three people playing one character, rather than three. Three characters opens up a beautiful can of possibilties for storytelling. <br/>Guy: Ooooh, shit, forgot one piece completely out of the beta-text, the mechanical effects of having different Aspect ratios.<br/>In the alpha unedited format: -/+# refers to Dice at Dice Pool. <br/> If Water&gt;Dirt then Rat+1 when Defending, -1 when Attacking(Initiating). <br/> If Dirt&gt;Water then Rat-1 when Defending, +1 when Attacking. <br/> If Rat+Dirt&gt;Water*2 then +1 to Initiator. <br/> If Water&gt;Rat+Dirt then -1 to Initiator. <br/> If Rat&gt;Dirt then +1 Social, -1 Mental. <br/> If Dirt&gt;Rat then -1 Social, +1 Mental.<br/>This will help make things less static, and cause alliances now and then to bring about/stop some of these.<br/>Eric: Nice. By Aspect Relations, do you mean you pyramid thing?<br/>Guy: Yes, the pyramid and especially what follows.<br/>Eric: (Oh, random commentary: Having the Physical/Social/Mental be based on pairs from Rat/Water/Dirt is good. I like the way it shakes things up in terms of the Aspect meanings.)<br/>Guy: Like in the Token bits? It'll be even cooler once you see the Hexagrams this results in on the sheet <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> I'm nothing if not about sending loaded-messages.<br/>Eric: I'm not sure how "hard" I would say it hits me...its more of a thing that I absorbed while reading and then brewed for a while. The bits like "Water is Meltdown" have implied but undefined meaning. They invite the reader to fill it in...and I like it.<br/>Guy: How do you like the Rats bit?<br/>Eric: Hmm...I like the Rat bit in that you see the Rat both as a primal drive and as a force of intelligence compared to Dirt and Water (inanimate elements). Or, more correctly, I see the Rat that way.<br/>Guy: Dirt is also a force of intelligence.<br/>Eric: Yeah, Rat isn't the only part that makes it up, but in terms of the rat alone the instinct/intelligence in one Aspect is interesting. I think the only line in that section I don't "get" is the Dirt is Drone part.<br/>Guy: Dirt is mind, intellect. If Dirt is maxed, you're acting by pure thought, with no emotion; you don't care. The aspect relations also put down in mechanical terms the "Rat goes up....." and such.<br/>Eric: Oh! Drone as opposed to emotion. Drone to me speaks more along the lines of "mindless drone", though on further reflection they would usually only be "mindless" because they display no emotions. Awesomeness.<br/>Guy: Also note how The World breaks the "World", it breaks the fourth wall.                        </div>

                            Game Version Beta 2.0 is up.<br/><br/>Much had been re-written, or written to clarify. Much had been condensed and re-organized to make it all easier to chew.<br/><br/>Some errors which populated version 1.2 as a result of changes from 1.1 being left behind are all gone(hopefully).<br/><br/>A rules change is that now you can spend dice on a two-for-one basis when you're not participating in a Conflict, and not only in Bidding.<br/><br/>Suburbia and the nature of Enlightenment are still left out, and will probably only be put in during the final version.<br/><br/>Glossary returned, will get meatier when I get into the right frame of mind.<br/><br/>File is available at <a href="http://craniumrats.pbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">Cranium Rats Central</a> as always.<br/>I also made a small Referance sheet.

                            Just to be clear on the purposes of this thread, this thread is here so one could see what changes occured, what brought them on and so forth.<br/><br/>More importantly, this thread is so I won't have to rely on my memory once the game is complete and I try to write-up the process that resulted in the finished product.<br/><br/>For now, as a test of the "Ashcan" issue, I have created an ashcan version of the game, <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/553074" rel="nofollow">available here</a> from Lulu.                        </div>

                            Well, we have a couple of things to report:<br/><br/>The <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1913" rel="nofollow">Underkoffler partial remix</a> thread where what's wrong with the game text is discussed. I just posted a question regarding content there.<br/><br/>Over at GameCraft we have a thread discussing <a href="http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=203" rel="nofollow">the scene that wasn't</a> and what it could showcase for the game, or how the game fails.                        </div>

<a href="http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=244" rel="nofollow">Cleaving the Beast in Twain</a> is where the CR project is going, it is going to be made into two or three different games. I want to seperate the different bits, and also see from that what is lacking in the mother-project.<br/><br/>Currently am stuck with finding a way to spread narration in Rats, the violent intertwined storyline half.                        </div>
