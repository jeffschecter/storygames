Colin (ccreitz) asked me to write it up, and since there was some cool fiction, and I also realized something pretty important about verisimillitude and how we made demands on each others' fictions, here it is. I said there was cool fiction, right? We can start with that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By:Joe on his blog 19 February 2009</cite>An excerpt from Johnstone's description of his character's demon, a passer:<br/><i>When he cuts her open, just under the breast bone and down a few inches, there is a<br/>plant, like peyote, under her skin. It is red inside, like a fig, sour and tangy like lime.<br/>Krauss eats it out of her, and the effect is more potent than LSD or mescaline. Her skin<br/>heals quickly. This is the first in a serious of similar discoveries.</i><br/><br/>Yes. That's what beauty reads like.<br/><br/>I'm GMing a game of Sorcerer...<br/><br/>It's set in Tangiers and Algeria, in late 1954. Algeria is still under French control, but there is a rebellious spirit building. In mere months, the first of the cafe bombings will occur. Tangiers is a different story - it's burgeoned into an experimental artist's haven. Drugs, sex, the avant-garde.<br/><br/>The characters are creators and seekers, ranging from artist dilettante to espionage agent to mad doctor.<br/>Demons are the producers of mind-altering experiences.<br/>Sorcerous rituals rely on creating, fabricating and investigation. Painting demonic visages with a "special paint" made from the hide of the Faiber Beast, which you acquired from a guy who knew a guy - that's how you contact a demon. That, and you get high.<br/><br/>In other words: Sanity death-spiral! Psychedelia! Mind-altering demons! Strange creatures! Cold war espionage! Avant-garde art! Lies!<br/>In other words: A tribute to Hunter S. Thompson, William S. Burroughs, and Wikipedia's entry on Algiers.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258900/#Comment_258900" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T01:38:13+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  1:38AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, so, Algiers and Tangiers, in 1954. Stalin is dead, the Algerian Revolution is about to begin, and Tangiers is still the international village known as Interzone. We are playing covert agents amidst the drug-addled, beatnik artist community.<br/><br/>Daniel's character is the incompetent son from an Austrian dynasty of industrialists (ie arms dealers). His father has sent him to Tangiers to finish a deal. But he is too afraid to make contact. Instead, he falls in love with a prostitute, and writes poetry. To cover himself, he lies. He writes fake reports back about how well he is doing, and how many contacts he has made, but he has only made one, so far. Through a ritual where he eats paint and cockroachs (I think) he summons a demon to live inside of him. It causes him to secrete a hallucinogen in his sweat. Demons, you see, are also psychedelic drugs.<br/><br/>His kicker: One of his father's agents shows up, in person, to see how well he has been doing.<br/><br/>During the game, he finally manages to go and see the guy who he was supposed to go and see. This guy wants a shipment of guns to be smuggled into Algeria. We the players know who the guns are for. Daniel's character does not. He also meets a strange giant caterpillar who gets him to eat its children and gain strange powers, like the ability to pass through dirt as if it were not there. And visions. I don't have any notes and stuff for his character, and my memory is only so sharp, so. Not much to say here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258901/#Comment_258901" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T01:38:38+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  1:38AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My character is Christopher Krauss, son of German immigrants to America. While studying journalism at UC Berkley, he was recruited by American intelligence to infiltrate Communist organizations. Then he decided Socialism is better and became a double agent.<br/><br/>English Name: Christopher Krauss; German Name: Christoph Heinrich Krauss; Literary Name: C.H. Krauss.<br/> Appearance: Late 30s, shaggy brown hair and beard. Krauss cultivates an air of stylish ambivalence and mysterious knowledge -- the kind of worldly mentor any young, aspiring writer or seeker of knowledge would find easy to hero-worship. A hip dude.<br/><br/>Stats: Humanity 5, Stamina 2 (Graceful), Will 5 (Mental Training, Manipulator), Lore 3 (Avant-Garde), Cover 5 (Intelligence Agent), Price: People Are Resources (-1 to non-manipulative social interactions).<br/><br/>After WWII, the spying business became intolerable. The Cold War made everything so very serious all of a sudden, and Krauss wanted a way out. Marxist economics, German occultism, and early psychedelic drug research* led him to a narrow yet ill-defined branch of medicine, and to track down its lone specialist, Dr. Amelia Tizara. And by "track down" I mean he summoned her from another reality by creating a trail of paperwork to justify her existence. She agreed to meet him at a medical conference in Paris, provided he made the arrangements. He agreed.<br/><br/>* I think we also discussed Soviet psychic research manuals.<br/><br/>Krauss met Amelia Tizara for the first time in the university's greenhouse. She was floating naked in the green murk of the hydroponic pools. Krauss brought clothes, and her entire history in paperwork that he had constructed in a mescaline-fueled haze. In return, she pulled him from the clutches of both American and Russian spymasters.<br/><br/>Krauss resurfaced in '49 as a successful author. He had friends, contacts. He knew important people, like always. Important people in Algiers, for instance. Who could blame him for leaving McCarthy's America?<br/> <br/>Kicker: It is 1954. The American ambassador throws a party at the consulate in Algiers. Krauss has a few words with men from the intelligence services, who make overtures, but nothing serious. There is a German at this party, a Soviet agent. He approaches Krauss, gives him a task, makes it clear he works for the Russians again. They want to know things, French things. With no options but to spy again, Krauss goes back to the Americans. They accept his offer gladly, and he is once again a double agent.<br/><br/>All his life, Krauss has aspired to Mussolini's description of Lenin: "an artist who has worked in men as others have worked in marble or metal" (Bullock 1993, 374). He preferred manipulating fictional people and merely socializing with the real ones, but the old life has come back for him. And no one is more pleased than Amelia Tizara...<br/><br/>Dr. Amelia Tizara<br/>Demon Type: Passer<br/>General Appearance: Attractive and professional, late 20s or early 30s.<br/>Binding Strength: +5 Christopher Krauss<br/>Stats: Stamina 2, Will 5, Lore 4, Power 5.<br/>Desire: Mischief.<br/>Need: To eat soil and sleep in water. She needs some sunlight, too, so she can't be locked up in a box or anything. Krauss keeps her in a bathtub in his house in Algiers. He has soil shipped in.<br/><br/>Abilities:<br/>Perception: she grows plants inside her body that, when consumed, grant visions of people she has touched and marked. And they get you high, too.<br/><br/>Link: Amelia and Krauss know where each other is at all times. This might be true of others who consume the drugs her plants produce, though most likely it only works one-way with them -- she knows where they are, they know very little.<br/><br/>Cover: Dr. Amelia Tizara is a specialist in the field of cognitive biology. She studies the physical psychology of altered states and anomalous experiences, concentrating on the effects of plant-based compounds on the human senses and nervous system.<br/><br/>Confuse: pheromones produced by the plants that grow in her body may cause humans to become confused and susceptible to suggestion. These pheromones are present in those who consume the drugs her plants produce, who do not always realize this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258902/#Comment_258902" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T01:39:28+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  1:39AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so, during the game:<br/><br/>Krauss' spymaster is an East German who shoots heroin in front of him whenever they meet. We played through the first contact scene. More on that later. This spymaster comes to see Krauss later on, at his home, which was an awesome scene.<br/><br/>This guy comes in, shoots up at the table, and starts talking to me. I try to palm his drugs, but he rolls better and notices. Then he asks suddenly "Why is there a naked woman standing over there?" And Joe describes Amelia coming into the room, naked and still wet, to see what kind of mischief she can get up to.<br/><br/>I deadpan him. "What are you talking about? There's nobody here but us." And I ignore Amelia. Daniel jumps in to play Amelia at this point, and talks to both of us. I continue to tell the spymaster (whose name I can't recall) that she is not there. Eventually he gets too creeped out and leaves us. Of course, the way we set up Humanity means this is exactly what you need to make a Humanity loss roll for, but I make it. So, I stay involved in the world, instead of being pushed farther into the psychedelic hallucinatory world of demons.<br/><br/>I have some shenanigans with the American ambassador. I'm not exactly spying for him, but he's involved. He also wants to try some drugs, so I get him some hash, and spike it with Amelia's drugs. I do this partly because I want Amelia to concentrate on watching my back and so she stays out of my spying-on-the-French operations, because she's a petulant little bitch who likes to stir up shit.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, she's a petulant little bitch who likes to stir up shit, so while the demon chauffeur of the ambassador's right-hand man tries to beat me up, she's fucked off trying to manipulate some French bureaucrat I was stupid enough to mention to her.<br/><br/>When I go and try to spy on the French guys, the head dude goes to a brothel, where he likes to have sex on a table fully laid out for a banquet feast. I get into the brothel, bribe the madame, and try to spy. But he gets busy in the kitchen, and the secret peep-hole windows only look into the girls' rooms. So, instead of sneaking outside and peering up through the window, I have to creep into the upstairs room, tie some bedsheets together, and climb out the balcony and hang about five feet off the ground peering through the window. Because I'm psychedelic. Obviously.<br/><br/>Anyway, after the French realize I'm onto them, the dude decides to skip to Tangiers and get his rocks off there. I decide the best plan is to open a brothel and lure him in. Amelia seems to like this idea, because it will give her control over a whole lot of people. I am usually exasperated with Amelia. She wants to jump back into stirring shit up full bore (she's been on the shelf for most of her 8 years, after all), and I want to creep back into the game slowly.<br/><br/>I had plans to keep writing books, of course. But with all my time spent spying, I can't write them myself. So I figured I would just steal them from other authors in Interzone, spice them up a bit and call them my own. Krauss is rather a bastard, after all.<br/><br/>I roleplayed Krauss very much like Johnny Depp portrays Hunter S. Thompson, only I pretend he's the main character of Naked Lunch instead of Fear and Loathing. I used a short pencil or a pen cap for a cigarette, and when I had a small plastic bowl for an ashtray, I managed to figure out how I could hold the cigarette and the ashtray in one hand and still be able to smoke it and tap the ash into the ashtray. All with one hand.<br/><br/>We didn't end up playing long enough that our two characters met up, though. Krauss never got to Tangiers, and Daniel's character never got to Algiers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258903/#Comment_258903" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T01:40:52+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  1:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, so, lessons learned.<br/><br/>Verisimilitude. This is when something that is not true or real feels like it is. It feels plausible, you buy into it. It is, oh lord, "realistic." Which really just means the storyteller has adequately justified it to you.<br/><br/>So the problem we had in this game is that me and Daniel set up a game that was very heavy on espionage. Spying and spycraft and covert ops. Now, I'm not an obsessive expert, or anything, but I feel pretty comfortable in this genre. I've read fiction, non-fiction, memoirs, seen good spy movies, etc. On the other hand, Joe, our GM, does NOT know the spy genre.<br/><br/>So what me and Daniel ended up doing is shooting down a lot of his stuff that we thought wasn't up to our standards. I might not have even noticed my own behaviour if Daniel wasn't doing it too. So when Joe brings something up, we both shoot it down, and tell him to do it again. Which is wrong, because this isn't really Joe's problem \u2013 it's my problem. If I'm the one who wants a certain level of verisimilitude in the game, then it's my responsibility to provide it.<br/><br/>I actually talked about this <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10798&amp;Focus=239702#Comment_239702" rel="nofollow">once before</a>, but with fake examples, and using a much smaller scale for contributions.<br/><br/>In the actual game, we really did say "No, you're running this scene all wrong," and then go on to correct him, and do one scene again. In which case, why aren't I just running the scene myself? (and if you think it would be weird to GM a scene for your own player character, we played Archipelago II pretty much like that).<br/><br/>So I came to the personal conclusion that it is your responsibility to contribute to somebody else's narration if you want them to reach the level of verisimilitude you need. If you have a lot of knowledge of a subject, then ask the other player what the important details of their narration are, and then fill in the details that make that possible for you to feel right with it. It's not cool to challenge other players to do better when they have different skills and expertise than you do, and you aren't helping them at all.<br/><br/>As for this game of Sorcerer, I realized what we should have been playing out was the friendships, feuds, and druggery inside the artistic community. Joe could have run us an awesome game of psychedelic artistic passions, plagiarism, petty and not-so-petty rivalries, and hallucinogenic betrayals, and I could have just narrated in all the spy shit myself. But we ended up playing something else instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259045/#Comment_259045" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T23:49:42+00:00" title="February 27, 2010 11:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!

And it took quite a while for them to beat it through my thick skull. They seemed pretty simple once I got it, though -- and I don't know if that's because we didn't use a whole lot of them, or because they are really simple. And that was fine, really. We built our game based on ideas, and in every area, at least two of us were on the same page, so it's not like we needed any extra mechanics outside of conflict resolution. We didn't seem to be lacking in any resource management, pacing mechanics, relationship rules, etc etc.<br/><br/>I'd play it again. Daniel had suggested running the game later on, after he felt he had been away from his character too long to go back, and I was interested, but we just ended up playing some other game instead.<br/><br/>The demons as agents of different hallucinogenic experiences was pretty central to the game as a Sorcerer game. We used that part of the Naked Lunch movie, where the cockroach, the mugwumps, the centipedes, etc are all different factions. If you like that part of the movie, then yeah, I'd suggest trying Sorcerer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259064/#Comment_259064" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T04:55:21+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  4:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>In other words: Sanity death-spiral!

It's a spy story at it's heart. And in Spione, you're each supposed to write down a secret on a piece of paper, put it into a hat, and each character draws one. At some point in the game, he has to admit this secret.<br/><br/>In the movie, he does stuff sort of like this several times -- telling bizarre non-sequiter stories, and shooting his wife.

Some people would probably say at great length, or even too much length, but we pretty much considered it part of play. I don't even remember who originally suggested Naked Lunch + Fear and Loathing. Our other idea was to do Hong Kong inspired by Fallen Angels, where demons are foreign influences, but we were all pretty excited to do Interzone.<br/><br/>We discussed what demons would be and what humanity represented until all three of us were absolutely on the same page. We went through other ideas, and finally arrived at the complicated hallucinogenic procedures that sort-of take you out of reality and bring you back with a demon. Humanity was alienation vs. socialization... uh, I mean you lose humanity for turning away from reality and society, or pushing others into that state. Spending more time with the drug-demon cold war thing was a call for Humanity loss as well. I think it was Daniel who encapsulated our final definition.<br/><br/>Daniel and Joe drove the discussion of Humanity and demons, because they had played the game before. Joe went and read Naked Lunch the book in between our discussions. I'm pretty sure he'd seen Fear and Loathing before the game, dunno about the movie Naked Lunch. I had only just read the book a few months earlier, though I know the movies fairly well. I'm fairly sure the other guys were drawing on stuff I don't know about.<br/><br/>When I decided to play Thompson in the William Lee role, the movie inspired me to add espionage elements to that character, so there would be some serious pressure on him. And since we're already in North Africa, and Battle of Algiers is a great movie, I added that in too. I don't remember whose idea the guns going to the FLN was, though I remember Daniel understood all my espionage stuff. They both liked these ideas, though.<br/><br/>So it's all pretty muddled together. We discussed the setting very thoroughly, but not how scenes should play out, and it only became obvious in play that we were demanding a level of expertise Joe didn't have. The other scenes were much better, when it was about strange characters interacting with each other and drugged-out shenanigans, we were totally doing the group-mind thing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>PS.

There's a lot of stuff in that thread, this was just one specific example.<br/><br/>Actually, we played Archipelago II afterwards, and I noticed we would start to do this again, same habit, and I tried to be conscious of it, and just fill in areas I thought needed verisimilitude, but it didn't come up all that much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259118/#Comment_259118" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T12:24:41+00:00" title="February 28, 2010 12:24PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm,<br/><br/>I think that the issue in this game was that our original conversation was about doing something "like Naked Lunch." Having just read the book, which is batshit-fucking-insane, I felt totally capable of doing that. Our original conversation was about "creators" doing "psychidelic summonings" through their art, some rituals of which required delving into non-existent places and hunting down people that didn't exist.<br/><br/>So, in the beginning, I think that the investigation was a component of the demonic art. At least, that was my understanding. Our definition of humanity (which may have been: your ability to distinguish reality from hallucination) reflected that, but also reflected the spy-heavy angle we took the game in.<br/><br/>When it came to the "batshit insane artists and perverts" angle, I had mixed luck.<br/>In my opinion, the weird mystery involving the men who all looked identical to Pascal and who engaged in weekly duck-fuckings was spot-on.<br/>As was the giant opiate-addicted caterpillar creature that could melt through things.<br/>I feel like I could have lifted those from the Naked Lunch book, and the Naked Lunch movie, respectively.<br/><br/>Once we hit spy territory, though, I should have stepped down. After all, I don't know it and can't do it. Or, I should have said, "Johnstone, this isn't going to work in this game. You can't play a spy, because it'll make the game fall apart. That's my failing, but you need to live with it." But some part of me refused to admit this failing. After all, Naked Lunch is one of my favourite books, Hunter S and William S continue to be my favourite authors, and I just freakin' love the whole genre of "batshit insane reflections of social dysfunction". And so, I thought to myself, how much can a little spying hurt?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259126/#Comment_259126" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T13:37:29+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  1:37PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

Just... with a grounding in real world cold war politics, and with versimiltude.<br/>And it was the requirement of grounding that killed me.<br/><br/>I think there was an element of "maybe it's all in his head" going on with Johnstone's character, too.<br/>He was basically playing Hunter S. Thompson, as a demon-summoning double agent.<br/><br/>He would hide under his desk with a gun in hand when his dealer knocked on the front door. He had a manipulative demon sleeping in his bathtub. He was constantly babbling about stalinist occultism (whatever the fuck that was).<br/><br/>So, it's not like he handed me a "straight spy story" that trashed the agreed-upon setting/premise. He handed me a "fucked up psychedelic spy story" which required a lot that wasn't originally agreed upon. Big difference, and harder to resolve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
