Not only was this a big year for sales con-wide, we also feel like this was the first year that we had a significant amount of "destination" sale - people coming straight to our booth to buy specific titles. This was also the first year that we didn't have booth coupons available (and I dont think we needed them).<br/><br/>So, by the numbers! We sold:<br/><br/>- 280 discrete products (in 2009 we moved 184 products, in 2008 we moved 161)<br/><br/>- 53 Remember Tomorrow (and sold out)<br/>- 34 Happy Birthday, Robot! (and 1 PDF) (and sold out)<br/>- 30 Dread House (and sold out)<br/>- 25 Kagematsu (and sold out)<br/>- 26 Blowback (and would have sold out except for preorder stock that hadn't been picked up)<br/>- 22 Mars Colony<br/>- 21 Annalise Final Edition<br/>- 17 Hell 4 Leather<br/>- 14 Time &amp; Temp<br/>- 12 Mecha (9 Hardcover and 3 Softcover)<br/>- 10 The Dance and the Dawn<br/>- 6 It's Complicated, Revised<br/>- 6 Labyrinths &amp; Lycanthropes (and sold out)<br/>- 4 Pro-Wrasslin' Battle Royale<br/><br/>As per usual, the new releases were the big sellers, with the older products showing less well. I was surprised (and pleased) that Time &amp; Temp and The Dance and the Dawn had solid showings, for second-year games (and, in the case of tD&amp;tD, a less well-known title). Obviously, we had some "buzzy" titles (Happy Birthday, Robot!, Blowback) that did very well, but there was actually remarkable equity among each publishers offerings this year - no one publisher "carried" the booth, like Gregor did with 3:16 in 2008.<br/><br/>Moneywise, we had a third year of growth. In 2008 we saw a roughly 125% ROI, in 2009 ~150%, and this year was right around 200%. If you're not aware, Design Matters operates on a cost-share/profit-share model, where each publisher buys in for an equal "share" of an overall booth budget, and then booth income is split into that number of shares. This year we had 6 full partners, 1 non-profit partner (who just gets reimbursed for their buyin), and two half-share partners, in addition to hosting Kagematsu for direct payout based on sales.<br/><br/>As always, Kevin and I will be re-evaluating the booth based on our observations of how we did this year - one pain point was that we ended up with a situation where we had more bodies involved than we really had work to spread out. While I love all of our comrades, and have no desire to change anything about how this year worked, this is certainly something we'll be examining with a critical eye - old hands from the Forge booth will remember the "wall of designers" problem, among others.<br/><br/>Another observation was that this was a down year for booth presences of folks in our community. We present our data and experiences with the hope that other folks will take a look and see that it is possible to put together a Gen Con booth that doesn't lose money, as long as there is a real reason for that booth to exist! So, obviously, the floor is open for any questions or comments. We particularly would be interested in hearing customer experiences with the booth this year!<br/><br/>Thanks again to everyone who came by and made this our best year to date - we really hope you all enjoy your games!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285880/#Comment_285880" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T13:06:10+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  1:06PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great numbers!<br/><br/>Was <i>carry</i> not for sale?<br/><br/>If you had too many designers in the booth, I certainly hope you sent some to Games on Demand to run games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285907/#Comment_285907" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T13:40:41+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  1:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2010 3:29PM by Double King.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear Handsome,<br/><br/>Congratulations again on another banner year for Design Matters!!<br/><br/>A couple of quick questions...<br/><br/>Were all products exclusive to the DM booth?

I have no idea if that had any impact but if I wasn't specifically looking for you, I probably would never have seen you let alone stopped to browse like I did in more visible areas. <br/><br/>It would be useful to know when games sold out. For example, if a game sold out on Saturday morning, could it have sold more if there was more to sell? <br/><br/>In general many exhibitors indicated this was their best year in at least 3-4 years. <br/><br/>The exhibit hall also had an outstanding turn out on Thursday (no idea why). But Saturday seemed to have lower attendance than normal. I would have never considered this but several exhibitors blamed the lower Saturday attendance on the celebrity contingent being lesser known and thus attracting less locals to the convention that typically buy 1 day passes. But I can't confirm if this is accurate. <br/><br/>Darksun sales also went slower than expected although still impressive. They sold 100 a day but it took till around 12:30 to sell out Thursday. Nothing to complain about. Pathfinder's Advanced Players Handbook sold well, I don't know to what extent but from rumors and eyeballing it, I'd say well over 500 copies but I wouldn't put much weight behind that number. I'd love to know how many copies Dresden Files sold. <br/><br/>I really liked Design Matters comfortable atmosphere, soft sell approach, game menu, and small and well displayed selection of games.<br/><br/>Congrats everyone!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285928/#Comment_285928" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T14:22:55+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  2:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To speak to games that we didn't have, our policy is that if a game has been out for 2+ years, we won't carry it at the booth. That means if it's available elsewhere on the floor (as is mostly the case) we direct people to other booths. This didn't come up super frequently, but when people were presented with that information they generally were cool with just wandering over to IPR (as it was a destination they were interested in anyway).<br/><br/>I do think we would have done better in a better location. We were hard to find and in a poorly trafficked area.<br/><br/>Most of the games that sold out, sold out on Sunday or late Saturday (nathan can correct me if I'm wrong about that). So i think we really hit the nail on the head stock-wise.<br/><br/>On the two days that GoD was running we made sure we always had two booth members present and ready to run games. I personally only put in one shift at GoD, and i played a game of Dread House. I had a good time, but i'm not sure if it pushed sales. I'd be interested to hear from other booth folks or customers who can talk to the DM - GoD relationship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lantern314" title="lantern314"><img alt="lantern314" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lantern314">lantern314</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285978/#Comment_285978" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T19:27:51+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  7:27PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the table                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285998/#Comment_285998" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T01:33:32+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  1:33AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well done guys!

I think IPR sold out of 3:16 early in the con (yay!) and got more themselves from Cubicle 7 (you can see the C7 logo on the books in one of the photos online). I only had one copy of 3:16 on me and Felicia Day asked me for it -- so I had to get a replacement copy myself (for Games on Demand) from Cubicle 7.<br/><br/>If anyone asked about games we didn't have (or I figured there was a game they would like) then we pointed them to other booths and gave them a copy of Steve's map. I directed people to Apocalypse World, S/Lay w/Me, Freemarket, Fiasco, Hell For Leather, Dresden. Our policy is that we want people to find games they have a great fit with. There is no point in selling someone a book they won't like -- they won't like it and they might even resent you for mis-selling it to them. I think it's a shame that there was nowhere carrying My Life with Master.<br/><br/>The Indie RPG Awards ceremony didn't seem to boost sales directly on Friday, but I got to catch up with Cynthia Celeste Miller because of it so it was a plus for me. With a little signage about its win it also bumped Kagematsu's sales (deservedly so). I think we could have sold a few more of the sold out things, but we were pretty close to the right numbers of books in most cases.<br/><br/>(Joe Prince's) Hell 4 Leather started slow but finished strong with word of mouth, I think it's a hell of a game and I was pleased to see it getting picked up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286029/#Comment_286029" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T06:44:42+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  6:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>I only had one copy of 3:16 on me and Felicia Day asked me for it</blockquote>\nStill <i>so</i> jealous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286033/#Comment_286033" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T07:04:27+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  7:04AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor &amp; Kevin pretty much covered it, but...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Was<i>carry</i>not for sale?</blockquote>\nIt was at IPR, and I had one copy with me just in case, but it's too old for our booth!\n<blockquote>If you had too many designers in the booth, I certainly hope you sent some to Games on Demand to run games.</blockquote>\nSee Kevin's comment. I was there for three shifts, and I played The Dance and the Dawn, "ran" Dread House (was the rules-person), and facilitated a game of Remember Tomorrow. I posted some thoughts in the GoD thread, but I think we could have benefited from signage and an actual displayed schedule with GM's names, games available and times. I'm also not terribly sure whether GoD pushed sales - I know that Dread House got played a lot, but it was selling strongly on Thursday and Friday anyway. I know that Hell 4 Leather got played afterhours, and that pushed some sales of that. Clint was running Mecha every time I saw him, and so forth.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Double King</cite>A couple of quick questions...<br/><br/>How do you handle shares vs. number of books each designer/publisher brought?</blockquote>\nShares are by publisher, and we recommend (based on past years sales) that people bring 30-50 copies of a new title, and 15-25 of an old one. I think this year pushes those numbers up for new/buzzy titles (I think we could have sold more Blowback, HBR and Rememember Tomorrow, f'rex). Every publisher is responsible for bringing their own stock and for dealing with it when the booth strikes.\n<blockquote>The above seems like a silent cry for cooperation with G.o.D. or some similar off-site merchandise ho-down.

For example, if a game sold out on Saturday morning, could it have sold more if there was more to sell?</blockquote>\nTo the best of my recollection: HBR sold out on Saturday, then we scrounged up one more book for Sunday, IIRC; Dread House sold out on Saturday, then Eppy managed to assemble a couple more emergency copies and we had a couple for Sunday (where it sold out for real); I think Remember Tomorrow sold out on Sunday; L&amp;L sold the last copy on Sunday; I don't remember when Kagematsu sold out, but I don't remember seeing it on Sunday morning; Blowback sold the last "stock" copy Sunday morning and we started selling them out of the preorder box.\n<blockquote>The exhibit hall also had an outstanding turn out on Thursday (no idea why).

But I can't confirm if this is accurate.</blockquote>\nWhen I ran the sales report on Thursday, I literally didn't believe it. I thought the software must have been broken. We did almost half of our business for the con on Thursday, it was insane.<br/><br/>For us, we had an incredibly great Thursday, an "average" Friday, a "good" Saturday and a "good" Sunday, compared to our previous years sales.\n<blockquote>I really liked Design Matters comfortable atmosphere, soft sell approach, game menu, and small and well displayed selection of games.</blockquote>\nThanks John!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lantern314</cite>Thanks for the table</blockquote>\nYou are welcome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286037/#Comment_286037" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T07:26:37+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  7:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great information- thanks for putting it up. <br/><br/>As I've said elsewhere, having you guys taking dedicated shifts at GoD was a great thing to see.  I can't say whether it boosted your sales, but I think it did help get the word out about several of your games.  Just having them on the table gave me a chance to describe the ones I knew to folks who came by looking for something new.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>If anyone asked about games we didn't have (or I figured there was a game they would like) then we pointed them to other booths and gave them a copy of Steve's map.</blockquote>\nWe did a lot of this at the IPR booth as well.  I've done a lot of retail customer service in the past, and I find I still really enjoy helping people find what they want so they walk away feeling satisfied.  Sometimes that meant leading them to a game in our booth and telling them why it's great, but often it was pointing them to DM, the Forge booth, or even to the nearest place where they could sit down and rest for a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286040/#Comment_286040" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T07:34:27+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  7:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2010 7:36AM by jenskot.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This probably should be in a new thread but for Design Matters, is GoD about sales at Gencon or future sales?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I bought Remember Tomorrow before I went to GoD but by playing it at GoD I now know how to actually play. Buying isn't knowing how to play (nor a guarantee some people will even fully read the book). Playing at GoD has made it much more likely I will not only play Remember Tomorrow but share it with more people. Which may mean future sales.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe my experience isn't common?<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: actually, I had already bought Remember Tomorrow but 2 of the players with us didn't and 1 bought a copy after the game. So maybe in cases where someone like me brings a group to GoD rather than come alone, it could mean present and future sales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
