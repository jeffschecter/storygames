I would like the game to have a couple of rpg elements, periods where the officers have to investigate, deal with politics, and maintain their unit's morale and other problems of maintain and navigating a standing army. Likewise, I would like the game to be tactical without being super crunchy. Any ideas? <br/><br/><br/>ps. I'd like to find an rpg, but I wouldn't be opposed to a light tabletop wargame and dropping an rpg system over it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439422/#Comment_439422" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-14T10:01:55+00:00" title="October 14, 2014 10:01AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have a game called Servants of Gaius you could try. But it isn't tactical. Sort of a light-weight Roman mystery setting. But we do have stuff in there on Legion hierarchy and have a pretty simply mass combat system where things are handled with just a couple of rolls. 43 AD is a good one. That is pretty focused on the military and, more specifically, on Britannia.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439435/#Comment_439435" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-14T17:51:43+00:00" title="October 14, 2014  5:51PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ohhhh!!!!

rel="nofollow"><b>Captains and Kings</b></a> just came out from THW. From the site:<br/><br/>===<br/><br/><i>What: Medieval Warband combat in the 9th to 13th Centuries.<br/><br/>Scale: Each 6 to 12 figure unit represents 40 - 60 actual combatants.<br/><br/>Your Role: Players start as a Captain in command of one unit. But if you succeed in battle, you gain fame and more units on your way to becoming King.<br/><br/>Playability: Designed for solo, same side and head to head play.<br/><br/>Captains and Kings can be played in a variety of ways and contains the following:<br/><br/>\u2022\tFourteen different armies, from Viking raiders to crusading Knights.<br/><br/>\u2022\tThree complete Campaigns including the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Danish raids on England and Ireland. <br/><br/>\u2022\tComplete rules for carrying out sieges.<br/><br/>\u2022\tTen unique but interlocking scenarios.<br/><br/>\u2022\tRules for fighting small raids to large battles, with up to 100 figures per side.<br/><br/>Captains and Kings can be played with any figures you already have whether metal, plastic, or paper. Play it as a Campaign where all battles are linked together or as a one-off game. Play it any way you like, just play it...you'll be glad you did!</i><br/><br/>===<br/><br/>... which seems pretty dead on in scale for what you describe in terms of mass combat, and you can work your way up to that fairly gradually. If you're looking for larger than that, you can get <a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/rally-round-the-king.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Rally 'Round the King</b></a>, which covers <i>much</i> larger conflicts (and if you're looking for a pile <a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/30to15adrrhi.html" rel="nofollow">more historical army lists</a> they've got tonnes).<br/><br/>Note the compatibility with <a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/wahele.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Warrior Heroes: Legends</b></a>, the fantasy skirmish/RPG-level game. It's pretty easy -- maybe too easy -- to nip the magic bits right out and run it as a straight up core RPG system. <a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/wahewa.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Warrior Heroes: Warbands</b></a> is more targeted at taking your warband from -- well -- warband to kingship, which while not the goal of the Roman Legionnaire, might be useful as a sort of means of advancement. <br/><br/>Checking my shelves, the most Roman setting RPG I have is <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/classic/rev_7004.phtml" rel="nofollow"><b>FVLMINATA</b></a>, which is basically a very light "what if? of "what if the Romans developed gunpowder?" Absolute beautiful piles of tight Roman history and social discussion and maybe one of the best historical non-historical sourcebooks I own. Plus, how often do you get a system that resolves things with sheep knuckles? Sadly, the developer has been working on a new edition with little luck, but has been posting <a href="http://www.fvlminata.com/" rel="nofollow">some <b>Savage Worlds</b> conversion stuff on his site</a>.<br/><br/>I truly adore Roman stuff, so I wish you the absolute best of luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
