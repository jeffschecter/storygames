I don't think people would want to jettison one of the existing games for a try-out (we're trying to run longer campaigns, so this would work directly against that).<br/><br/>But, it's London.  There must be folk around who might want to meet up one evening in some suitable pub or suchlike for a bit of Fiasco or RT or both.  I'm particularly tempted with Fiasco by the 1936 and 1913 playsets both of which look awesome, or the Flyover one which also looks rather cool (but could be harder for Brits to pull off?  Not sure).<br/><br/>Any London based storygamers want to give these a spin some time?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shadowmourne" title="Shadowmourne"><img alt="Shadowmourne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/130/nQVJZC4DDIYSK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shadowmourne">Shadowmourne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287097/#Comment_287097" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T06:22:49+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  6:22AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in.<br/><br/>Just let me know where and when etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287101/#Comment_287101" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T06:34:57+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  6:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

I'm familiar with the stuff in the 1913 and 1936 ones because I've seen a lot of the relevant movies and read many of the relevant books, but that could just be me and my personal tastes.  I'm not familiar with the stuff in Flyover - others may be but that means there's at least one person who isn't.<br/><br/>Good point then.  I suppose as in many story games it's really critical to ensure that everyone at the table is buzzed with the choice made.  I have heard of some folk getting disappointing results when the playset was a setting they weren't familiar with.<br/><br/>Gangster London is a great looking playset, but it's a cinematic genre I don't personally enjoy which is why I hadn't suggested that one.  That said, for a London based group it'd certainly be familiar to everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287195/#Comment_287195" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T09:48:02+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second what Steve says: one of the rockiest games of Fiasco I ever played was with the Boomtown playset.  In theory we were all Americans and understood Western movies, but in practice there's a wide range of tones and feels there, and we didn't do the best job of getting on the same page before we started play. <br/><br/>The rockiness was a result of three things: a small group (three of us), two players who hadn't played before, and a playset that was too flexible and didn't suggest a single mood.  <br/><br/>And I say "rockiness" on purpose: it was still a good game, but when we said, "hey, there are two more hours in the session, let's try another playset," we chose one of the modern American playsets, and the game CAUGHT ON FIRE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
