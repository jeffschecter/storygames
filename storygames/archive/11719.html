Do I need to change up my approach at all?  I know that's a hopelessly vague question, so let me try to focus it a bit. <br/><br/>The DMG2 paragon tier advice amounted to "make the stakes bigger, and go to Sigil."  I'm not interested too much in Sigil (though maybe the players might be) and I think I can escalate the stakes appropriately from the heroic tier.  <br/><br/>But what about encounter design?   Do the best practices change at the paragon tier?  Are there new grinds or new anticlimaxes to avoid?<br/><br/>(I like the term 'best practices' because the OReilly best practices books have been pretty illuminating to me.

This can make them more difficult to challenge.  In that sense the best practices shift a bit.<br/><br/>I've found that the default baddie damage output is a bit low across the game but this is especially noticable beginning at Paragon.  Part of my answer to this in encounter design came in the form of higher damage enviromental hazards, ones that the NPCs on their home terrain find it easier to avoid.  Fifty-foot drops are a nice baseline; PCs that shrug and yawn at equal-leveled Lurker or Artillery damage start to actually take notice at 5d10.  Hazards like elevation can also serve to divide some of the party from their Leader(s), making those PCs lives more interesting.  As at Heroic tier, though, whenever you divide the party make sure both halves face fun opposition.  Healing surge drain and heavier ongoing damage are other useful enviromental hazards that may have overwhelmed the PCs at Heroic tier but now they can take it.  <br/><br/>You'll also have noticed that that Paragon Paths give the PCs additional power whenever they have Action Points.  Encounter design might take this into account by encouraging the PCs to burn them in an encounter that seems more threatening than it turns out to be, some kind of AP drain threat (don't overdo this!), or some other method.  <br/><br/>Look closely at the Rituals available to Paragon level PCs.  They start to become more potent and interesting.  If the players are in the habit of ignoring Rituals, make sure they are aware of this shift and make sure those potent and interesting Rituals are available to the PCs.  Design your encounters such that casting just the right Ritual prior to a telegraphed encounter is a nice asset.<br/><br/>Magic items, consumables and spells give Paragon PCs access to Resist10 versus a variety of damage types.  Because of damage scaling issues, you have to be even more careful to vary your damage types in any given encounter.  That cool encounter you had planned with the party against 4 Medusae?  Yeah, the wizard just put Poison Resist10 on the whole party.  What's your back-up plan, smart guy?  (waves of harpies!!!)  <br/><br/>Good luck.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261493/#Comment_261493" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T14:43:47+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  2:43PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew, that's exactly the kind of advice I want.

True in Heroic and then goes to a new level in Paragon for sure.<br/><br/>You know that multiplication effect you saw in Heroic where you'd run for a varying number of players and 5 PCs were more than 25% tougher than 4 PCs and 6 PCs were more than 50% tougher than 4 PCs?  Because of super-charged APs and their large number of Powers, Paragons PCs can put out a lot of burst power/actions for a time and seem like a larger number of characters - increasingly power in the form of actions that hobble Solos.  Even though Solos are supposedly worth 4-5 times the XP in opposition, they only get one turn and generally only a couple of attacks.  Definitely have to watch that.<br/><br/>I don't use Solos much but my Solos and Elites can pay 10% of their hit points once or twice an encounter to get all their Saves at the <i>beginning</i> of their turns instead of the end.  To avoid (at a cost) some of that lockdown while still giving the PCs their due; "Wizard player: 'Well, he broke my Daze but it's like my spell did 26 extra damage!' or 'Hurray!  My spell did the equivalent of 26 extra damage and he's <i>still</i> Dazed!'"  Don't know how you feel about new house rules in the middle of a campaign, but maybe this is a new "chapter."  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261514/#Comment_261514" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T18:01:55+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  6:01PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

A lot of the Paths have amazing story grist and  organizations associated with them.  I'd have loved to start working those organizations into the tapestry of the world.<br/><br/>There's this amorphous "D&amp;D world" out there where the empowered players (in 4E in particular) have this gigantic menu of options.  That's great!  But once they've made those choices, I like to highlight them; maybe there's really only effectively five or six "Paragon Paths" in the whole world and the 2-3 organizations tied to those 5-6 Paths are monolithic/critical.  But if those organizations just "appear" when the PCs hit level 11, how important/real were they really?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261519/#Comment_261519" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T18:37:22+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  6:37PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Oh!
