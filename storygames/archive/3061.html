My father's company is looking for one and there's some money involved: the last figure mentioned was 200 dollars, but it's negotiable and they're open to percentages or whatever too.<br/><br/>Anyway, whisper to me if you know or are someone suitable.<br/><br/>I realise this thread messes with the zen, but since it's an opportunity to spread the love, and the money, I thought I'd give it a go.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
