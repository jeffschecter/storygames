Here's the story:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Happy Birthday, Robot!<br/><br/>Robot laughs and dances the tango, but by himself<br/><br/>Robot's presents and the ponies are missing, but he isn't too worried.<br/><br/>Robot thinks his friends--all but Natasha--rode the ponies away to the hills.<br/><br/>Maybe Natasha, being a jerk, hid Robot's presents for a terrible surprise, but Robot loves her anyway.<br/><br/>But now, Natasha comes bounding out of her cave, shouts "surprise," throws confetti, and hugs Robot sweetly.<br/><br/>ROBOT: Are you teaching me a lesson that I shouldn't care about presents?<br/>ROBOT: Or are you just being a big MEANIE?!?!<br/><i>EXEUNT, DANCING THE TANGO<br/></i><br/>--<br/><br/>We all enjoyed it and would like to play again. We didn't flip any coins and buy free words, because we had big strings of "0" come up on the dice, racking up the coins. Below is a scan of our game with the dice rolls and final coin totals. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hatchibombotar/3842797227/" rel="nofollow" title="Happy Birthday Robot 2009-08-21 by Hatchibombotar, on Flickr"><img alt="Happy Birthday Robot 2009-08-21" height="500" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3418/3842797227_61936989fd.jpg" width="403"/></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226590/#Comment_226590" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T15:47:09+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  3:47PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, J really did rack up the coins quickly. This seems like a pretty short story, how long did it take to play? Also, out of curiosity, how did you pitch the game to them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bevedog" title="bevedog"><img alt="bevedog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stevelawson.name/icons/steve-in-3D-32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bevedog">bevedog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226593/#Comment_226593" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T17:01:15+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  5:01PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It took most of our lunch hour, but that included at least 10 minutes to eat and look at the rules, a short break for more drinks, a few stories about our kids, etc. The fact that it ended before we flipped any coins seemed odd, but I guess it was just the roll of the dice. We also thought if we played again perhaps we'd play to maximize the number of rounds, rather than trying to get the most 0's on the dice (as the instructions say).<br/><br/>The pitch was easy. I knew that Marianne played RPGs and other games with her friends, and I knew that Jessy was interested in poetry and other literature created Oulipo/Surrealist fashion. So I just sent them both links to the rules and asked if they'd like to play over lunch. We work in a college library, so this is our last slow week, so it was pretty easy to get together.  That's something great about this game, that you can convene a group who has never played it before to play it in an hour or less.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226750/#Comment_226750" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T10:50:21+00:00" title="August 22, 2009 10:50AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, thanks for sharing your story! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
