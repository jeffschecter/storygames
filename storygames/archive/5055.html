A lot of games are designed around the PCs being awesome (like in supers games) or the like, and where the game assumes the PCs are good, just heroes and the system tells them how to do heroic things (like, say, D&amp;D), but how many games are actually designed around goodness?

The Protagonist isn't the "good guy" - he's the guy who does things. The Antagonist is the guy who tries to stop him. In Die Hard, Bruce Willis is the antagonist.
