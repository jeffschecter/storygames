We have tried allowing Action Points to be used as re-rolls, but there was some weirdness with that.  John Harper suggested that we spend a healing surge for a re-roll.  That worked pretty well, but some thing still felt off about it.  Ultimately, I think the issue comes down to one of game balance.  The below method should reduce the overall whiffness of the game and lead to more blood on all sides.<br/><br/>Lets look at the situation holistically, rather than piece meal.  <br/><br/>Why use Healing Surges for re-rolls?<br/>  *  The is sacrificing his survivability for effectiveness by exerting himself when it really matters.<br/>  *  Re-rolls mean more damage is inflicted.  This keeps the encounters shorter and bloodier.  <br/>  *  This preserves the roll of action points and prevents any confusion as to when Action Point powers are triggered.<br/>  *  Reliable Powers can be re-rolled or they can miss and be used again later (as per normal).<br/>  *  Only Paragon Classes with re-roll powers can get 2 re-rolls on the same attack.<br/><br/>Rules for PCs using Healing Surge Re-Rolls <br/>  *  2 Healing Surges - Re-roll a Daily Power<br/>  *  1 Healing Surge - Re-roll any other roll (including saving throws, skill checks, and damage.)<br/>  *  +1 Healing Surge if you rolled a Natural 1 (just an extra penalty for really sucking)<br/>  *  You must keep the result of the 2nd roll.<br/>  *  Maximum 1 Healing Surge re-roll per roll.<br/><br/>To balance this out, the DM also gets re-rolls for his forces.  Monsters have healing surges that they don\u2019t get to use during a fight, but they do have them.  In addition, it just as frustrating for a DM to totally whiff with his awesome power or to have his heavy hitter totally stymied by failed saving throw.<br/><br/>Encounter Level <span style="color: #FFFFFF;">_____________</span>DM Re-Roll pool<br/>  *  Equal to PCs Level<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">________</span>5 Re-rolls<br/>  *  Per 1 less than PC level<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">____</span>+1 re-roll<br/>  *  Per 1 more than PC level<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">___</span>-1 re-roll<br/><br/>Weaker monsters need a bit more luck and tougher monsters need a bit less luck.<br/><br/>Thus PC Level is 10.<br/>Encounter Level 8<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">___</span>=<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">___</span>7 DM re-rolls<br/>Encounter Level 10<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">___</span>=<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">___</span>5 DM re-rolls<br/>Encounter Level 13<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">___</span>=<span style="color: #FFFFFF;">___</span>2 DM re-rolls<br/><br/>Rules for DM using Healing Surge Re-Rolls <br/>  *  2 Healing Surges - Re-roll a Power with a Recharge Roll<br/>  *  1 Healing Surge - Re-roll any other roll (including saving throws, skill checks, and damage.)<br/>  *  +1 Healing Surge if you rolled a Natural 1 (just an extra penalty for really sucking)<br/>  *  You must keep the result of the 2nd roll.<br/>  *  Maximum 1 Healing Surge re-roll per roll.<br/><br/>This is the latest incarnation of the method that we are going to try.  I am putting it out there for comments.  We have not tried it in play yet.<br/>edit: for format                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151757/#Comment_151757" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T20:38:53+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  8:38PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2008 8:42PM by Callan_S.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what accounts I've read that refer to whiffyness*, on a regular basis it seems to be where you get your turn, and it's a roll to see if you have absolutely no effect on the game. Roll to see if your input is meaningless. Again and again. Every miss of a sword strike, for example, leaves no currency mark on the game what-so-ever.<br/><br/>IF that's the core of the problem (and it might not be in this circumstance, but hey, I'm just working from what I know of 'whiff'), then rerolls are just delaying the problem - ie, you roll twice to see whether you have no effect, rather than once.<br/><br/>My suggestion, which I've dabbled with sort of in some playtests, is to make the entirety of the roll count. One idea that springs to mind is that on a miss, the roll made on the D20 is XP earned (learn from your mistakes, if you want a causal reason). You roll a 4, you get 4xp (adjust number for level (keeping in mind handling time though)). And an idea I playtested once was that (this was with level 1 characters) that a miss still equals 1 point of damage. Though I suspect 1 point didn't feel much better than an entire miss, for my players.<br/><br/>I've also considered having certain baddies designated as mooks** and on a miss, you still get to remove one from the board. On a hit you get to remove one and do damage to a regular monster. My concern (haven't tested this) is a matter of space, handling time, and what happens when I run out of mooks. Actually, thinking on that now, perhaps there could be a per round reinforcement number, for mooks - so X amount trickle in every round. Okay, so I'm rambling now so I'll just think aloud. Hmm, what if they fill up the room? Have a limit on the number of mooks who will pour in at a time? Gah, the monsters wouldn't hold back at a certain amount - but then again it's kind of simmy of me to think that way. Hmmm...<br/><br/>* Haven't read any about 4E, just other games. Indeed I was rather surprised that with 4E I heard with some powers, if the attack is resisted, they still take some damage or some effect. It seemed like they were addressing the 'roll to see whether I'm wasting my time' whiff problem.<br/><br/>** Yes, I know 4E has mook rules. These guys would be even mookier. Seriously!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151760/#Comment_151760" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T21:22:21+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  9:22PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Roll to see if your input is meaningless.</blockquote>\nThat's a great understanding of whiffness.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>One idea that springs to mind is that on a miss, the roll made on the D20 is XP earned (learn from your mistakes, if you want a causal reason).

Because, I believe, this is a death spiral. If you spend all of these healing surges and still can't connect, you won't last very long and you'll be forcing the party to rest more often and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson" title="Zak Arntson"><img alt="Zak Arntson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/147/nVMQWQSYECWCV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson">Zak Arntson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151859/#Comment_151859" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T10:30:48+00:00" title="June 20, 2008 10:30AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another.

Basically, if you miss, you get an (X).  At the end of the adventure, you get (# of (X)) * 5 * level.  This way there is no complicated book keeping.<br/><br/>One interesting side effect of this method is that it might help to balance the fully optimized PCs vs the non-optimized PCs.  It does, however, favor combat characters versus support characters.  Although that is much less of an issue in 4e.<br/><br/>Mark:  Using Healing Surges in this way will not cause a Death Spiral.  Typically, you have more Healing Surges than you can spend and you can always rest (if the adventure allows it.)  A character typically will spend more than 2 Healing Surges during a single combat (although the *might* spend 3, if they have 2 Support characters in their group.)  Plus, if I have learned anything from D&amp;D, it is that failing to use your awesome ability is worse than dying.

And conceptually it transforms a miss from "a whiff" into "I didn't hit you...yet...but I'm getting closer".<br/><br/>You could do all sorts of fun stuff with that, including Critical Fumbles...lose all your stones when you roll a 1.  Then you wouldn't need a limit on how many stones you can hold on to...because eventually you'll roll a 1 and lose them all.<br/><br/>I'd also say you lose them all with an extended rest.  That would be even more compelling a reason not to rest than losing APs.<br/><br/>You could even do some really fun stuff...like turn in 5 stones to not lose a power you whiffed on (basically make the power "Reliable" for that one miss).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151970">\n<div

So, as one means of meeting that goal, the whiff bonus only happens on the first roll that fails during your turn. Whether your rolling a dozen times, once, or twice, only the first roll that misses grants the bonus.<br/><br/>Alternatively if any of your attacks on your turn manage to hit/do damage, then even if all your other attacks whiffed, you get no wiff bonus. You had an effect on game currency, so no need for a compensatory currency to come into effect.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, the thing to remember is that this goal means a currency change - thats going to cause ripples through all other currencies. Indeed, that's the idea! That the player effects the game every single turn.<br/><br/>How I see it is you weigh up "The player having an effect on the game economy every turn" Vs "Having a stable game economy". Which do you put first? That's up to each of us, really.<br/><br/><br/>On the anger meter, I don't think it meets the goal (as I understand the goal). It's a currency which makes you whiff less, rather than making every single roll count. The anger currency has no effect outside of making future hits more likely, thus it isn't having a flow on effect onto the rest of the games economies. Mind you, my XP idea almost has the same problem - it's effect wont be for a considerable time (leveling only, and crafting, if 4E still has XP costs for crafting).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152286/#Comment_152286" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T16:46:48+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  4:46PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2008 4:50PM by Simon_C.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>People who make more rolls get more tokens. People who make more rolls need tokens more.<br/><br/>Seems fine to me.</blockquote>\nThat's a good point, but I think it's still wonky.  Consider the ranger.  The ranger has several powers that involve multiple attack rolls, so they'll be building up a lot of tokens.  But the ranger also has a lot of single-attack-roll, high-damage powers.  They'll be hitting with those a heck of a lot more than the poor fighter, who has relatively few multiple-attack powers.  <br/><br/>Here's how I'd do this, if I were going to (I haven't played the game yet, so I can't say if I think the whiff factor is too high - I want to believe that effective combinations of powers with flanking and buffs will mitigate that a lot):<br/><br/>After rolling the dice for attack powers (to hit, but not damage, probably), the player can choose: a) the power takes effect using the dice as rolled, or b) the power has no effect (including miss effects) and you get a re-roll token.  You can only do this with encounter and daily powers, not at-will powers.  You can only spend one re-roll per roll, and any accumulated re-rolls are lost when you take an extended rest.<br/><br/>That way, if a wizard gets a single hit on a minion with their fireball, they can trade that for a hit later.  You can describe it as the power distracting the opponent, the character discovering some weakness in the opponent, or whatever.  It's a little more fiddly, and introduces some redundant rolling, which is not ideal, but it does give the players a choice every round.  Restricting it to daily and encounter powers is important, I think, because otherwise there'll be way too many re-rolls floating around, and it'll lead to odd tactics like powering-up against a minion, to get a bunch of re-rolls against a boss.  Also, I think the misses really hurt the most with the encounter and daily powers, so that's where you need the mitigating factor.<br/><br/>There's a minor problem with powers that have miss effects being less attractive (since you have to lose the miss effect for the re-roll) but I think that once people have a couple of re-rolls "banked", they'll opt for the miss effect, if it's at all useful.<br/><br/>EDIT: Spending a re-roll means you have to re-roll all the dice used for the power.  You can't hit with all but one of your attacks, and then re-roll the last one, and you can't miss with everything, and then only get to re-roll one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152493/#Comment_152493" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T15:20:22+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  3:20PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I haven't played the game yet</blockquote>\nIGNORE.<br/><br/>Just kidding.

Their at-will power does damage when they miss, so they already have anti-whiff built in. If the tokens are better for the ranger or rogue or whatever, I don't think it will bother the fighters much. But I also think the fighters get the whiff token when they miss AND they do damage.

Mostly.<br/><br/>It probably is wise to take everything I say on this topic with a grain of salt.  I'm coming from a background of a LOT of experience with 3.5, and pretty good familiarity with the rules of 4, but nothing beats knowing how the game feels in actual play.<br/><br/>I wonder if part of the issue here is about wanting different things from the game?  For me, the enjoyment of D&amp;D since 3e. has been the mathematical challenge of it - the <i>illusion</i> of balance, even when such balance doesn't exist, and the fact that you're playing is what is supposedly a game that's robust against exploits and cheap moves.  The rules say to me "Here are your limitations, now what crazy things can you do?" That applies to playing the game, as well as character creation.  <br/><br/>For that reason, any house rule I introduce has to be as robust as possible, and affect the balance between the classes as little as possible, or else I feel like I'm not accepting the limitations the game imposes.  I'm especially wary of house rules in games like D&amp;D, where character death is such a stong disincentive.  I never want the player to be in a situation where they feel like the dodgy house-rule killed them, not the "real" game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152543/#Comment_152543" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T16:58:26+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  4:58PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, we want different things, Simon.
