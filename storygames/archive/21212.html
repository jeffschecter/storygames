It usually takes about half an hour.</p>\n<p>First of all, that \u201cabstract track\u201d idea is garbage. I\u2019d never want to play that way. Corsairs of the Great Sea has a portion of the dungeon in the second adventure represented that way, the outer part before you get to the core, which is mapped out normally. I replace that part with a Dyson\u2019s delve and stuck some of the encounters on there and some on the wandering monster\u2019s list.</p>\n<p>But, node maps, yes. I\u2019ve used that a lot. That \u201cZone map\u201d above is actually plenty detailed. For example, I like the stocker from donjon.bin.sh fine enough but I don\u2019t like the maps it generates. <a href="http://idiomdrottning.org/lava_hell.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here\u2019s a dungeon I ran, the Lava Hell</a>, that has stocking from donjon.bin.sh but just a nodemap instead. I put all of the stats on there so this one was super quick to use in play.</p>\n<p>Red Tide also has a fast method that I like where you have a grid of rooms instead of a grid of floor tiles. I had high expectations of it from someone\u2019s review, bought the book for that method alone, read it, and went \u201cHuh, this sucks, I was already doing nodemaps and this is a step back\u201d, and left a comment on the review site \u2014 only to in practice get soooo much mileage out of that method in Red Tide, I\u2019ve regretted that comment so much but I\u2019ve never found it again to be able to post a correction. Sometimes it\u2019s even easier than a node map and it tends to lead to highly jaquayed dungeons automatically. (And, not to mention the rest of the book; so much awesome has entered my game through Red Tide \u2014 I\u2019m not sure about the setting but I usally reskin everything).</p>\n<p>However.</p>\n<p>Maps usually aren\u2019t the problem. There are plenty of maps online and I have a couple of books of Dyson\u2019s delves. And, I have geomorphs (I have the \u201cDungeonmorph\u201d cards). And, I\u2019m pretty good at drawing maps myself (though that takes a lot of time). I even have that poster, \u201cRandom Dungeon Generator as a Dungeon Map\u201d based on the 1e DMG tables.</p>\n<p><a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/1J5D6C.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here\u2019s an example of how I sometimes prep dungeons made with geomorphs</a>. (Lot of the stockings in that one came from books like the Dungeon ABC and from Zak\u2019s list of rooms.)</p>\n<p>(Tip: You can also mix &amp; match. A nodemap or a Red Tide style \u201cDiagram dungeon\u201d where some or all the nodes are geomorphs for example.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, as I was saying, maps aren\u2019t the problem. Stocking is. I sometimes use the tables in the DMG for example. I\u2019m only just now getting faster at it.</p>\n<p>Again Red Tide to the rescue especially if you want to go fractal. It suggests starting by drawing up the \u201cforce\u201d of those who lives in the dungeon. \u201cFive goblins, three super-goblins, six wolves.\u201d or whatever. That also makes it easier to generate treasure using 5e\u2019s or ACKS\u2019 treasure generators since you have all the residents collected. Then you can place them and the treasure in rooms &amp; on \u201cwandering\u201d tables as you wish.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464802/#Comment_464802" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-15T06:14:22+00:00" title="July 15, 2017  6:14AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>To me, if you aren\u2019t prepping your dungeons, there\u2019s no reason to do dungeons except nostalgia/skeumorphism.

The advantages are similar to roguelike computer games. I personally find this a legit approach that can be used to distinguish certain types of content in a greater sandbox - or to simplify GMing in general, of course. For example, one thing I could see myself doing is creating a random generator for "troll caves" for our on-going campaign, so that I could always have some trivially varying yet fundamentally similar troll caves on hand when a need for such is indicated by random encounter tables.<br/><br/>I recommend either geomorphs or prompted drawing as the base procedure for generating the dungeon architecture. "Geomorphs" are essentially jigsaw pieces that can be shuffled and layed out to form a greater dungeon; they're good for maze-y and tight dungeons. "Prompted drawing" is when you work off a set of tables and such that indicate to you that "the kitchen room connects to the nursery", and you execute the drawing yourself; it's a better method for creating expansive node-y style dungeons where individual rooms have highly distinctive looks, yet the architecture still makes some sense.<br/><br/>Once you've got an architecture that looks correct, you can fill it with monsters and such. Two main generation procedures are room-by-room and top-down, which work for slightly different purposes. In the room-by-room method you roll on appropriate tables for each room in turn, and then retroactively justify why the ghoul and the goblin are living as room-mates. In the top-down method you establish dungeon content in big blocks first ("this troll cave has a shrine, implying d4 shamans plus see shrine loot table") and then assign the stuff into individual rooms as best makes sense.<br/><br/>My recommended approach for doing this sort of thing is to develop your own random procedure for a relatively tightly defined world simulation and flavour combination. That is, rather than scouring the net for a big kitchen sink pre-made dungeon process, rather identify what kinds of dungeons your campaign milieu has, and craft independent procedures for "dank tombs" and "troll caves" and "outlaw hideouts". This is an excellent way to make dungeons feel distinctive from each other, and the players will appreciate the tactical possibilities - despite the dungeons being "random", the players can still rely on "dank tombs" and "troll caves" coming off entirely independent procedures that have their own strategic traits that can be analyzed and taken advantage of, once figured out.<br/><br/>I'll note that dungeon-prep approaches that do not result in a gameable dungeon are, I think, a wider question than merely low-prep dungeoneering. By "gameable" I mean that if your prep does not clearly indicate tactical space and specific nature of hazards and rewards, then you're no longer prepping a "dungeon" in any meaningful procedural sense. Nothing wrong with that, but I'll desist from speculating upon non-prepped dungeon play for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464813/#Comment_464813" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-15T13:18:17+00:00" title="July 15, 2017  1:18PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks all.

So I found out that having a theme and/or a mood is often more than enough to give me plenty of ideas for the descriptions.<br/><br/>I use <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/464255/#Comment_464255" rel="nofollow">cards</a> with several words, icons and images on them for inspiration but they are basically just random tables in a deck format.<br/><br/>Forget about the deck format for a moment, it's just personal convenience; the tables went through lots of testing and simplification in order to make them produce organical, reasonable results mixing the least amount of tables and making them as simple as possible.<br/><br/>For example, if you make a list of possible triggers for a trap and another of dangerouns things a trap could do, you get interesting traps you can reason into the room and setting in no time, that wargamey players can traverse with the proper experimentation and interactions. Define a trap by these two elements and you will see that you won't need to come up with a solution as a GM. The players will find one just as fine.<br/><br/>To generate rooms I use two other random tables: one for the general shape of the room and one for the exit. If you follow the theme, mood and logical function of the whole place, things will make better sense. You will definitely have barracks somewhat close to an armory and a mess room somewhere between, if the place is meant to be a fortress. You would definitely skip those for the ruined temple of a pacific goddess. But then there's how more recent occupations could have changed the place. Perhaps now the sancta sanctorum is an armory because it's the best place to keep the weapons dry. Perhaps the old armory caved in and now part of the mess had to be turned into the new armory.<br/><br/>You could also generate social encounters with two lists: a list of archetypes for the NPCs and a list of emotions to be portrayed by them when the PCs interact with them. That alone sparks many interesting new possible developmets in the story. I mean, if you see an NPC getting angry at some other NPC, your natural instinct is to ask yourself for the reason and soon you will find really interesting twists and connections there.<br/><br/>Besides from that, there's my favorite prep trick: focus on a theme/mood combination, google "fantasy concept art" related to that and pick any 5 to 7 images, linking them up as needed. Then I write down a couple of notes to help me describe anything that isn't already being conveyed through the picture and finally search/calculate the proper monster stat blocks (which is the part that always takes more time)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464878/#Comment_464878" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-18T07:29:33+00:00" title="July 18, 2017  7:29AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2017 7:30AM by Rob_Alexander.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Three minutes?

The basic idea is to establish the type of dungeon (as Eero's examples of "dank tomb" vs. "outlaw hideout") up front, along with one or more themes ("chaos &amp; destruction," "forbidden knowledge," etc.), which together give you some structural hooks to work with when it comes to improvising or interpreting random rolls. If you have a few more minutes, you can scribble down "common" and "unique" area types, creating a list of locations that you can employ as needed.<br/><br/>In my current playtest draft of the 2nd edition of <i>Freebooters on the Frontier</i>, the random encounter check is folded into the exploration roll (intended for use with both wilderness and dungeon exploration):<br/><br/>----------------------<br/><br/><b>VENTURE FORTH</b><br/>When you <i><b>set out into dangerous or unfamiliar territory</b></i>, your starting point is a juncture. The Judge will describe your surroundings. Say which way you\u2019re going from there, and what you\u2019re looking for (the next point of interest, a safe campsite, the tracks of your quarry, etc.)\u2014that\u2019s your destination. Then, decide whether you\u2019re going to move ahead <i>quickly</i>, <i>cautiously</i>, or <i>taking care to ensure the way back is safe</i>.<br/><br/>When you <i><b>move ahead quickly</b></i>, the party member with the lowest Dexterity rolls +DEX: <b>on a 10+</b>, you\u2019ll reach the next juncture in record time, expending minimal resources; <b>on a 7+</b>, choose 1 from the list below.<br/><br/>When you <i><b>move ahead cautiously</b></i>, choose a scout to roll +WIS: <b>on a 10+</b>, you get the drop on whatever lies ahead; <b>on a 7+</b>, choose 1 from the list below.<br/><br/>When you <i><b>move ahead while taking care to ensure the way back is safe</b></i>, choose someone to roll +INT: <b>on a 10+</b>, the route back to the last juncture is indeed safe, until the Judge deems otherwise; <b>on a 7+</b>, choose 1 from the list below.<br/><br/>* You make a Discovery along the way<br/>* You notice something useful about the environment\u2014work with the Judge to describe it<br/>* You choose one other party member to Keep Company with someone else<br/><br/>When you <i><b>Venture Forth and roll doubles</b></i>, the Judge introduces a Danger (in addition to the usual result). If you\u2019re not waylaid, you reach a next juncture of the Judge\u2019s choosing (which might be your destination, or merely one step closer to it)<br/><br/>----------------------<br/><br/>Nearly all of our dungeons in sandbox play are established on the fly. In between sessions, if I know the PCs will be returning to a given site, I'll use my prep time to flesh it out further. Sometimes, when spatial relationships seem important, that means going as far as drawing a map, but usually it means editing my area list, thinking a little deeper about the context and implications, and writing up some more detailed discoveries and dangers.<br/><br/>In my experience, it's a tradeoff. Pre-written dungeons grant the luxury of confidence as long as you've taken the time to read (or write) the material; improv dungeons feel more exciting and alive, but can be a challenge to run smoothly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464942/#Comment_464942" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-22T19:49:38+00:00" title="July 22, 2017  7:49PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jason \u2014 I don't know Freebooters, only Perilous, but those moves look interesting.
