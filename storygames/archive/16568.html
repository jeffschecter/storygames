Aside from Game Chef, most in-development indie games were not discussed much on the Forge outside of the Actual Play forum. Indie Game Design and First Thoughts were mostly places for excited folks (including myself, back in the day) to talk about game concepts that ultimately went nowhere. The things the Forge did a good job at -- like encouraging people to think seriously about design and play -- could happen in other venues too.<br/><br/>I think regular real-time meet-ups are a must. The internet makes that possible even if folks are non-local, through stuff like Skype, G+, chat, and whatnot. Not as good as a regular, in-person meetup, but it seems like a lot of people have issues finding local people to talk hardcore game design stuff with, since they might not live in the game design utopias of the PacNW. And regular real-time things become some kind of accountability, as long as they are stricktly focused on game design and don't become just social hangouts.<br/><br/>In my mind, a good game design community should focus on stuff that has been created (and doesn't just exist in someone's head) and getting that stuff to the table as soon as possible.  Basically, a community that focuses on actual play as the entire point of design. If nothing has been created or played recently, you don't meet, unless it's to talk about problems someone's having in putting together the next draft; instead, you spend that time creating or playing new stuff, so you can have something to talk about next time. So basically: make stuff + play stuff. Everything else is in service to that. No speculation, no bullshit, and no "I have this cool idea!"  If it's not written down in a semi-playable form, it doesn't matter. The cost of entry is making a solid attempt at your concept. And the cost of continuing to get attention is making substantial revisions or actually playing your game (with other community members or whoever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379316/#Comment_379316" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T14:54:14+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  2:54PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found Indie RPG Design, on the Forge, very helpful.

One of the most powerful things about indie game design is the ability to abandon something that you're working on for weeks, months, years, or forever. Most of the games you start probably won't end up being enjoyable enough to finish. Encouraging people to abandon a project that's not working and do something else is really important. Most attempts at game design are for learning how to do stuff, which you can then implement in a different project later down the line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379330/#Comment_379330" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T15:37:31+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  3:37PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2012 3:39PM by Hans_c-o.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ross and Jonathan, you are both right.

As I said in the other thread, I think "first thoughts" forums tend to focus attention on the people who are least serious about following through with their ideas while simultaneously causing burnout in the people that are most valuable in supporting a community (i.e. the people who read and respond to stuff). I'm generally skeptical of the "ask focused question" approach, since understanding my problems well enough to articulate good questions generally gets me 95% of the way to solving them, at which point a discussion thread is barely useful anymore. In the past I've found it helpful to have conversations about my design problems because the process of talking about them helped me think about them in a different way which led to solutions, but I don't think I've ever experienced that on a forum. I think forum threads could theoretically work very well for "usability test my text" types of threads, where people post their drafts and basically ask "could you play this game?". Having other sets of eyes tell you which parts of your text are hard to understand (or are just plain missing) is something valuable that a designer can't really get working on their own -- most writers agree that it's difficult to look at their own text the way a new reader would. I'm not sure how many people are actually interested in doing that, though -- as I mentioned in a <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2012/05/15/short-games-penny-wise-and-pound-foolish/" rel="nofollow">recent blog post</a>, people are generally disinclined to read long documents, and games that attempt to actually address things that would confuse new readers, etc., tend to be longer than people are comfortable reading.<br/><br/>The most useful feedback I ever got from a forum was on Joshua A.C. Newman's <i>Game Designer Studio</i> forum, where Simon Carryer told me that the way I wrote one of my earlier drafts with lots of Capitalized Terms for game terms that were Important to the Procedures made the text read like it was Very Pretentious. The focus there was much more on layout and presentation, which I think could have been very cool if my game had been in the proper state to talk about that stuff when the forum was active. I did create a thread talking about layout stuff for my game here on S-G, and I eventually got some feedback that I think was useful, but it was not easy to get people to express their viewpoints in a way that I could understand them.<br/><br/>I think a good design community would help foster connections. Something like G+ really only works well for people you already know. Maybe if there were more "connectors" in the community who helped facilitate introductions it would work, but right now almost everybody works as their own creative nodes (or perhaps in their small group of friends) and rely on cultural osmosis for their ideas to spread. One of the theoretical benefits of something like a forum community is that you can see who is working on stuff and what they're working on, and potentially build a relationship based on mutual interest in a design topic that you might not realize you shared if your only interaction was to scan their social media profile page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379348/#Comment_379348" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T16:44:15+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  4:44PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found Joshua's Game Designer Studio incredibly useful too.

I haven't done it much lately -- due to Game Chef and work -- but right after I announced that I was doing "volunteer indie game consulting" (<a href="http://corvidsun.com/2011/12/28/the-tentative-plan/" rel="nofollow">this blog post from late December</a>), I reviewed and talked through the games of 3-4 different designers and I think it really helped them figure out some next steps. What people often seem to want is somebody to ask them questions, not provide them with answers, since most folks know what they need to do, they just need help ignoring all the other crap that's distracting their focus and making them less certain. That kind of small-group, committed model would be something I would try again, even over the imperfect medium of the internet. Of course, sometimes the next step is: go play your game with some real people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379451/#Comment_379451" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T07:21:14+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  7:21AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the original thread, I listed what I think makes S-G (and before it, The Forge) good for design. I'll refocus, now that Andy weighed in on that thread.<br/><br/>* Portal - "The One Location To Inform Them All." It takes a lot less effort to go to one site and browse new threads than to stalk the internet (or even just G+) for new ideas floating out and needing polish.<br/>* Community - (and to a lesser extent, Expertise) I know to whom I'm speaking, here; have even met several of you in person. At an "International Meetup To Design" venue, not so much. This could be neutral, this could be a bonus (new eyes, new blood).<br/><br/>SO what if S-G just have a subforum called, say, "Design Nexus". One may start a thread there, BUT it must conform to these basic guidelines:<br/>1) A link to a shared Google Doc, Hangout/Skype channel, blog-with-commenting-on, etc. THis is the ACTUAL location where design discussion happens, NOT on S-G.<br/>2) A discrete request. Could be "Please read for comprehensibility" up to "need full playtests of campaign play, with feedback on rough spots" to "critique my layout/design." NOT "what do you think?" open-ended questions. Hmmm, though one might could ask such; I just wouldn't expect any real traffic from vague requests.<br/>3) LIMITED supporting quotes (e.g., rule snippet, if one is having a dice math problem or similar). Again, NO discussion on S-G--hell, can you make a subforum that's set to "don't allow replies" by default, like a Locked thread (i.e., auto-lock all threads as they are created)?<br/><br/>That might be the best of both worlds: we have a "hub" for good folks with good eyes; but the forum isn't bloated with design faff (or, at least, no more than one post per endeavor).<br/><br/>Obviously, one could go and make some kind of forum/posting/blogging site that does all and only this function; but it would have to gain community all over again, while S-G grows community almost by default, as cons and events attract new players to the games, who go do searches and find 90% of hits about a given new "indie" game on The Forge or here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379566/#Comment_379566" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T15:03:46+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  3:03PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beats me.

Is it about getting the most games? The best games? Games from the greatest number of people? Maximizing the profits of the designers? People can disagree about those things (and many others) without realizing it, which can shade their opinions of lower-level implementation details or lead to miscommunications.<br/><br/>I think that in order for a design community to be functional it can't be value-neutral or all-things-to-all-people. For example, a community that embraces the "real artists ship" idea can promote processes that support that and discourage processes that lead to endless noodling. People need to be able to make certain assumptions and not restart every discussion from first principles or add endless caveats or "in my opinion" qualifiers. There's obviously a balance there (you don't want want to be so rigid and dogmatic that you can't innovate), but common philosophies and expectations are an institution that a community can aggregate around (even if they aren't formally articulated). For example, I think the Forge had an implicit expectation that the goal was for designers to create and independently publish their own commercial-quality RPGs. Personally, I believe that some of the philosophies associated with the Agile software development world are worth embracing for more/better tabletop RPG designs.<br/><br/>In addition to talking about what definitely will work (does anyone even know?), it's probably also useful to think about ideas that might work. I don't know if these are necessarily generalizable, but in Game Chef 2009 Jonathan experimented with an "achievement" system. Most people seemed to hate that round of Game Chef, but I thought there were some interesting ideas in it. For example, there were progressive submission deadlines, but one of the rules was that you could only claim the achievement for a later deadline if you playtested and revised your game since the previous deadline. This created an incentive to actually playtest in a timely way. There was also supposed to be an achievement based on getting lots of "special thanks" mentions in other chefs' submissions, which was an incentive to go out and give other people the feedback, etc., that they wanted (unfortunately the contest fizzled before that one was supposed to kick in). There was also a weird design contest a few years back where randomly selected groups of four were required to create and commercially release a game within a month -- it seemed like there were some interesting ideas embedded in that concept. Figuring out how to work in a team together is a way of building a relationship (possibly negative) with someone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379839/#Comment_379839" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T20:28:40+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  8:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about this, and I actually think the most important element doesn't have anything to do with <i>my</i> games.

The site admin does this automatically, without even reading the posts, when certain conditions are met.<br/><br/>The condition is that 12 separate people, each with a decent post count (so they haven't shown up just to do this), must publicly flag the post for removal.<br/><br/>The guideline for removal is this.  Person A posts.  Person B asks, "How does that help me make my game better?"  If Person A responds with anything other than, "Oops, my bad," or a sincere argument for how their post is in fact aimed at the game's best interests, then readers ought to begin the flagging.<br/><br/>Once the community deems your post worthy of removal, you are kicked out to whatever degree of specificity the admin tools allow.  Either the thread or the forum, I guess.<br/><br/>These rules could easily give rise to antagonistic cults, but I have higher hopes for the decency of posters here.  This idea is founded on the assumption that community-minded users will always outnumber trolls and dicks, and that we can police ourselves if given a clear means for doing so.  This also puts no burden on the admin and thus won't burn them out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379982/#Comment_379982" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T16:34:48+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  4:34PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My ideal design community is two other people who share a lot of my tastes and really want my input in their games and really want to give their input into mine.

Internet communication has gotten better and better over time but there seems to be a reluctance to embrace it. If more people were willing to help each other over the net, more games would get done faster and better (at least that's my view). It seems like the clustering of game design around local scenes or the big conventions that has developed organically for the past few years might be a local optimum but exploring other arrangements might lead to something that was better overall.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>My ideal design community is two other people who share a lot of my tastes and really want my input in their games and really want to give their input into mine.  So I guess my ideal community tools would be means of finding those people.</blockquote>\nTo an extent I find this argument appealing, but I know that my personal perception of my tastes is probably narrower than the full range of things I can enjoy (for example, without the buzz around them I would have assumed that I had no interest in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> or <i>Apocalypse World</i>). I forget where I read it, but I've seen the argument that too much groupthink is bad for creativity, and that a good creative environment will expose you to voices and POVs that are different from your own (obviously a contentious and argumentative place can be bad for creativity, too). In the business and academic worlds, sometimes things as simple as whose offices are near each other has been a catalyst for creativity and productive work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380053/#Comment_380053" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T10:08:07+00:00" title="May 29, 2012 10:08AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2012 10:13AM by timfire.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think an ideal (online) design community would include some sort of built-in document sharing feature.<br/><br/>[edit] All the really functional online communities I've been apart of have included various annual get togethers, though the focus has always been online discussion.

I agree with you that it's valuable!  I've just seen how much more valuable (to me) dedicated close collaboration is.  <br/><br/>Someone who will take all the time and effort to get on board with a game I'm making, and they'd really want to play it or run it, and they enjoy contributing, and they have the energy and motivation to really think hard about the stuff I churn out, and discuss it with me... that makes my work way better, faster, and more fun.  And I honestly enjoy reciprocating.  Being really involved in a game design without having to be ultimately responsible for every final decision is quite nice!<br/><br/>I've gone through periods in the past where I actually had this.  What I didn't have was a collaborator who knew anything at all about game design.  I was no expert either.  So our progress was somewhat limited.  So another one of my hopes would be to find collaborators who are good at this, at least in ways that I'm not.  Hopefully I can learn from them, and they can learn from me on the things that I'm good at.<br/><br/>Maybe some sort of profiles/wanted ads hub could be built...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380716/#Comment_380716" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T10:55:00+00:00" title="June  4, 2012 10:55AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Less agendas and more sincerity is all you need.

I would love to participate in some kind of online community dedicated to discussing RPG design, but I wonder if it'd be doomed from day one if its goal was simply to replicate a community that has already dissolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo those who note that a local, offline community is better: Well, yeah, but that's not always feasible, and there's no reason you shouldn't be able to have that and also participate in a solid online community. I mean, I simultaneously belong to both online and offline communities for my other interests, so why not this one?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I'd love to participate in a design forum that:<br/>\n\u2022 prioritizes development of original systems and/or settings over hacks of existing systems and generic homebrews<br/>\n\u2022\xa0encourages finished-quality deliverables that could be enjoyed by the community as the end goal of feedback discussions (whether in the form of publications for sale or free PDFs to circulate online)<br/>\n\u2022\xa0has regulars who check in at least a few times a week<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I just ignorantly described "The Forge 2.0" without even realizing it, though, I welcome you to direct me back to my first point above.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Edited because BBCode did some unexpected things that messed up my formatting.
