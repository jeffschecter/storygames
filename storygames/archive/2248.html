                    So in the thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2241&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>Meshing external conflict to multiple internal conflicts</b></a>, we're looking at the goal of meshing conflicts -- i.e. creating a separate external conflict to mesh with the internal one.  I'd like to discuss a bit about more generally the place of internal conflicts.  I think this cuts to the heart of what I talk about in <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/narrative/paradigms.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Story and Narrative Paradigms in RPGs</b></a>.  <br/><br/>Here's the short form:  Within a play, internal conflicts are only visible by externalization (or rarely by voice-over / soliloquy).  Within a book, internal conflicts are visible by both externalization and narration (i.e. authorial voice).  Within an RPG, internal conflicts are potentially visible by externalization, narration, and direct understanding.  i.e. If I'm playing a character engaged in a struggle, I can see the internal conflict.  <br/><br/>Now, by imitation of plays and films, we can try to bring out the internal to external action as much as possible.  <br/><br/>However, there's another level to internal conflicts -- i.e. the ones which you can directly see, the ones which your PC experiences.  My question is, what most enhances enjoyment of these?  Note that this is different than externalization.  I can enjoy a conflict without it being externalized -- but that doesn't mean that it's automatic.  It is still enhanced by external play.  <br/><br/>For example, in one game, my PC fell in love.  He was conflicted over how to approach the woman, though, because she was an immortal goddess who had suddenly become a mortal human -- and was in some senses an innocent whom the PCs were protecting.  Now, he was fairly clear in his attraction, but I found out later that the other players completely misread him -- thinking that he was just lusting after her, when really he had romantic ambitions and was waiting for the right time to propose to her.  <br/><br/>The thing is, that I enjoyed the conflict <i>right then</i>.  It was interesting to me regardless of what happened later.  My question (which I don't know the answer to) is what enhances that enjoyment.  <br/><br/>I know that believability issues can kill it, for example, but that's only a negative answer.                </div>

                            As I said in the linked thread above, I actually find this sort of play annoying in the extreme.  At base level, it feels to me like the other players at the table are not sharing the fun, and are hoarding their little piece of entertaining story for themselves.  When one of these players reveals these secret, internal stories, I inevitably think, "Well, if I had known <em>that</em> was happening, I could have played up to it, engaged it, played off of it, or otherwise had fun with that player about that story line."  If it's kept secret, though, I never get that chance.  I often wonder if this habit is a reaction to "don't let the GM know what you really want because he'll stomp on it" and other gamer-tropes.<br><br>On the other hand, I may be totally crazy and in the wrong.  So I'd love to hear what other folks have to say about this.  Is such an internal storyline any more enjoyable because it is "secret?"  Is it born out of the belief, perhaps backed up by past experience, that nobody else will contribute constructively?  I just don't <em>get</em> it.                        </br></br></div>

                            I've had different experiences, this is a great question.<br/><br/>I have said "God, my dude is so conflicted over this!" and gotten some grins and "Yeah!" but nobody ever fed into it. I assume they liked and valued the feeling that this conflict was natural, that it had grown out of circumstances, like I had just given them a new insight into an already-favored text or film.<br/><br/>Other times I have enjoyed a character's internal conflict without ever expressing it to other people for fear they would interfere with its "natural development", either by shoving it at me more emphatically or (more likely) casually resolving it and not letting my dude stew in his own misery for long enough.                        </div>

Joshua, I deliberately wanted to set this thread on a positive note.  At least on this thread, I don't want to have to defend the fact that I had fun when my character was in internal conflict.  Instead, I would like accepted that I enjoyed this -- and I want to ask about other people about similar experiences, and what most enhanced that enjoyment.  <br/><br/>Yes, there are lots of other ways to enjoy RPGs.  You can enjoy the story told by other characters, or the externalizing of other characters internal conflicts, or tactical challenge, or exploring background, or plenty of other things.  But for this thread, we're talking about enjoying your own PCs internal conflicts.  <br/><br/>Later on we can talk about how to merge this sort of enjoyment with other types of enjoyment, but right now I'd like to have a little focus.                        </div>

I agree with this, I think.  Certainly I can't think of an instance offhand where navel-gazing was interesting.  Rook's falling in love was internal to him, but was most certainly driven by interaction with other characters and lead to interaction.  <br/><br/>To take another case, in the "Karm v. Osric" larp at AmberCon NorthWest (run by Fred Hicks et al.) -- I played Prince Osric in disguise.  I made myself known to several other PCs (and thus their players), as well as a few who already knew of my disguise.  However, often I was interacting with people who didn't know.  I was dancing with Lady Sonnet when she mentioned a rumor that Osric's dead fiancee may have been murdered rather than committed suicide.  I immediately stopped and dropped my disguise act to ask about this.  "If something was done to my love...  er, I mean, to my lord Osric's love..."  That was great fun from my point of view, but Lady Sonnet / Stephanie had no idea at the time what was going on.  She didn't realize that I was Osric in disguise until the debriefing after the game.  On the other hand, when we talked later she said that she enjoyed my character even if she didn't understand it.  <br/><br/>I think this fulfill's Tony's suggestion exactly -- since in-character, I immediately started suspecting different people of having killed her.  And by the end of the larp, I killed off a woman whom I <i>falsely</i> thought had killed her.                        </div>

That's how you play <i>Amber</i>!<br/><br/>JBR:  I don't think that talking about the purely internal <i>aspects</i> of a conflict can only mean that the conflict is secret-secret.  Maybe we're just not talking about the parts where you share it with the other players.  I usually walk into these types of things assuming that the internal conflict is something <b>someone else</b> prepared and handed me, for instance:  "Tony, I think your character should totally fall for the ex-goddess," "Oh AWESOME!  Good call!  I'm on it."  But even if somebody knew exactly what my internal conflict was, and could see <i>signs</i> of it in my play, I myself have a different experience of the conflict ... I have access to some stuff inside that is private.  Let's talk about that stuff!                        </div>

                            Actually, John, I see Josh's reaction as a contrasting experience to the one you're describing.  From the right perspective it might help throw your topic into relief.<br/><br/>Josh is describing, I think, the experience of playing with someone else who invents and dwells on their internal conflict, doesn't share it at all with the table, and is possibly concealing his contribution from the GM for fear that it'll be stomped on.  In a lot of ways, he is describing maladaptive behavior.  This one player is, in essence, playing his own little game with the assistance of everyone else.  Taking but not giving.<br/><br/>I presume that it's also an assessment made from an author stance.  When you expect everyone to be describing their characters motivations, and riffing off one another, it's almost a betrayal to conceal part of that presentation.<br/><br/>The phenomenon John is after, I think, is the experience of playing a character with a strong internal conflict - usually unexpected.  For instance, a character with an explicit stand on a moral question presented with a dilemma that brings the stand into doubt.  (I'm thinking of Luke's advice on running Burning Stuff: "Yeah, well, do you believe that now?")  There's a decided enjoyment to chewing over that conflict and acting on it, and there can be a secondary enjoyment to being at the table with a player who's doing that, since they tend to have their characters behave in consistent but surprising ways.  <br/><br/>I tend to think that the enjoyment of an internal conflict this way relies on more of an actor's stance.  As the internal conflict of an author's character, it's more enjoyable to say "hey guys, check this out!"  But for an actor's character there's enjoyment to wrestling with the conflict for a little while as a result.  Between sessions or between scenes it might be worthwhile to step out and say "hey, here's what I'm dealing with," but even that would depend on the table.                        </div>

                            I haven't quite figured out how to bring the enjoyment I find in internal conflict entirely to the table during play.  What's often ended up happening is that I'll discuss internal conflict <i>in between</i> sessions; my friend Tim and I are particularly apt to email back and forth about what internal issues our characters are experiencing, usually cc-ing our GM on the discussions.  I get a lot of fun out of these discussions, BTW; I love sitting around after the session and saying, "Oh man, Lutra totally wanted to help with that, but she HATES that guy!" or whatever.  It would be really cool to find a way to somehow make that a greater part of the in-game, rather that out-of-character, discussion.<br/><br/>A game that uses Keys or similar things (like TSOY) sort of goes halfway to that, assuming the other players are aware of your characters' Keys.  If everyone knows my PC has the Keys of Conscience AND Bloodlust, they're going to be aware that there's some juicy internal conflict going on there, and they can kind of play to that.  But beyond that, I'm not sure how to express it.  It often feels unnatural to tell people in-game what one's character is <i>thinking</i>, although I've done it before.                        </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>Is there any degree to which this kind of internal conflict is enhanced by the way it resonates with issues in your real life?

Or is there more vibe in conflicts that get at some kind of core issue of the character, or those which change or challenge the fringes of character concept without risking the center? <br/><br/>(Sorry, I only have questions here, and no help to give.

I don't know if this will help anyone else, but I am a bit confused by the "direct understanding" category. How am I achieving this direct understanding, if not by observing my character's external actions or through an ongoing internal narration on behalf of my character? It seems to me that at the beginning of a game all players in an RPG should have the same level of access to a character's internal conflicts -- none of them share a psychological space with the character by default, and so they all have just as much of an ability to extrapolate the character's internal state. What one player (the player playing that character) has is authority to determine what internal narrative is correct for the character, and every time the player makes such a determination without informing the other players they are that much further from being able to create their own equally legitimate internal narration for that character.<br/><br/>Maybe this is just me chasing the usual 'what is immersion' trail, but that's not my intention. It's worth pointing out that, following from the above, I do -- as a player -- come up with internal narrative for any and all characters that I am interested in during a play session. This includes other people's PCs. And, as mentioned, my version of what their character is feeling is just as accurate as theirs is, until such a point as they externalise their version either through action or through narration. The more often they do that, the easier it is for me to play along -- but if they never narrate any specific internal states, I still have a fairly easy time of it up until they have their character perform an action that clearly shows how differently we're understanding the character. At this point I am surprised, and possibly either disappointed or delighted -- or just confused, since I can't figure out where our two versions of the character diverged.<br/><br/>So I guess my feeling is that all players at the table have access to this 'direct apprehension,' and furthermore that it is not limited to RPGs in the least -- we can do the same thing when reading a story, simply by thinking about the characters and empathising with them outside of whatever the author is specifically narrating. Same goes for any sort of fiction. The author may have his own internal model based on facts that do not yet exist in the fiction, but that doesn't seem all that relevant to the legitimacy of everyone else's opinions about what is really going on inside the character.                        </div>

You have a point.  I have dragged in stuff about legitimacy, which wasn't really my intent.  Ugh!  My point should be simply that you as a player create that internal narrative and derive enjoyment from that internal narrative.  <br/><br/>I guess there could be a companion thread about "Enjoying other people's PC's internal conflicts" -- which is just as legitimate, I agree.  (Or rather, I don't think that legitimacy should enter into it.  There's no wrong enjoyment here.)  Ultimately, your enjoyment comes from what you experience -- not from what is physically spoken.  <br/><br/>I guess going back -- do you find that there's a difference for you between enjoying the internal narrative of your character and the internal narrative of someone else's character?  I know that for myself, I'm typically much more focused on imagining my character's internal narrative than anyone else's.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I tend to focus more on my own character's internal conflicts than I do on those of anyone else's PC.  I spend more time on every other detail of my own character than I do on anyone else's, so it shouldn't be too surprising when that turns out to be the case for internal narratives, too.  That's just the way it goes.<br/><br/>I typically don't worry about anyone else's character's internal conflicts until it's brought up in some way (like the guy above with the "God, my character is so conflicted over this!" comment): and even then, it's basically their playground and I'm not going to try to invade it.  Without express and explicit invitation to push their internal-conflict buttons, I'll probably keep well away from it, just because I can never tell whether they're saying it as a sign of appreciation for how awesomely fun it is that their character's in that kind of turmoil, or as a sign that I'm supposed to try and help their PC solve that internal crisis, or as a sign that I'm supposed to try and intensify that crisis, or even if they're just saying it to be saying something.<br/><br/>Because when I say something like that about my own character, many times <i>I'm</i> not even sure if I want anyone else to mess with it.  Sometimes I'd rather everyone else kept their filthy hands off of it, sometimes I just want the GM to push on it more (or less), sometimes I want other PCs to be able to use it as a way to set up a scene with my guy, and it can be very difficult for me to tell which is which when I'm really engaged in the game.  If I'm really having that much fun with my character's internal issues, I'm not likely to want to step out of character enough to make that kind of decision...I'm just going to go with what I've got and enjoy it.                        </div>

Yeah, it depends on group contract.  <br/><br/>It's possible that you could express your internal conflicts and the other players are just thinking "God, would he just <i>shut up</i> about how conflicted he is!  What a grand-stander!"  <br/><br/>On the other hand, it's possible that everyone is expecting you to express your inner conflicts openly, and are disappointed when you don't -- thinking "What a turtle, just going around and doing stuff while keeping everything inside to himself."                        </div>

I think it depends on what's happening in the game. It's true that overall, I'm probably going to be focusing more on my character's internal narrative -- part of that is because I made the character, so it's probably pretty interesting to me, and part of that is because the character is my responsibility. Inasmuch as the group cares about characters having internal states and psychological motivations, it's my job to 'run' that part of my character. Part of what I was pointing out is just that anyone could run it just as well as me, but maybe this is just a case of definition: part of what makes it 'my character' is that I am the one paying attention to those extra bits and pieces.<br/><br/>But as for 'what's happening in the game,' sometimes my character isn't in a scene, or doesn't really have much going on in a session even. In that case it's quite likely that I am spending more time imagining what's going on in other PC's heads than I am in my PC's head. Pointing out that anyone can do this 'work' and anyone can enjoy it equally, 'directly', what-have-you is just to say that there is a mode of play where everyone has only the one PC, or where everyone has every PC in the scene -- from the point of view of this enjoyment. If you disassociate <i>authority</i> over a character's internal states with <i>knowledge</i> of those states, it becomes clear that everyone can get the enjoyment of this 'direct apprehension', of mulling over a character's conflicts and reactions and motivations and enjoying their own personal take on the character. <br/><br/>Which doesn't mean that everyone should do this, or whatever. Annoying chess analogy aside, I agree with Corley that it's not somehow cruel or unusual to keep your take on your character to yourself. I just think it's entirely possible for everyone to participate in every character's internal conflicts and narrative, even if only one of them has the authority to decide how it ultimately plays out.<br/><br/>Personally, I like to share my character's internal narrative as much as possible, because whenever I make something cool I want to show it off to other people. So if something really interesting happens 'in my character's head' I want to make sure that gets across somehow. If I'm feeling restrained or ambitious I definitely will consider trying to show, rather than tell -- finding a way to demonstrate my character's unique state of mind or take on the situation -- but just as often I might just spell it out. And in any case I will definitely want to share it at some point outside the game.<br/><br/>But, to tie it back in, I also like to talk to other players outside the game about what I think <i>their</i> characters were feeling, or how I understood their actions, or what direction they seemed to be going in emotionally. And I want other players to tell me the same thing about my character -- in part because they might have some insight, and in part because that will tell me how effectively I am getting across what I want to with my portrayal of the character.                        </div>

Yes, I think this is just restating what was before -- that you can enjoy envisioning internal conflict within anyone's character.  <br/><br/>Interestingly, I notice in many games that players remain in character even in scenes which their character isn't in.  So they might make a meta-game comment "That's disgusting" -- which reflects their <i>character</i> even though their character isn't present. <br/>I call this in-character but out-of-game comments.   They're interpreted as what the character <i>would have said</i> if they were present.

I generally enjoy talking about the game outside of immediate actions, but I don't feel a compulsion to talk about everything.   Reflecting on it, I think I feel that there are some things which are interesting to talk about outside the game -- and others which are mainly fun within the game.  There are a lot of the core elements of the character which I think aren't done justice when talking about -- i.e. that are much more interesting to show than tell.  That's all I have for the moment.                        </div>
