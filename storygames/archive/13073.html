But it's really hard to grasp all of it at one go.  After a lot of games with a lot to digest, it seems crazy to try to get people to understand all the different hoohaws and whatchamagoos that go into a Mage character. But!  I really like the modern-day magic-and-horror concept, and I like the detailed system.  So I was thinking that maybe an interesting Mage game might be an apprentice-level mage game - just post-Awakening, when people are trying to get a grasp on what's going on. They haven't joined a magical tradition or anything yet - just the power of the secret tower with their name inscribed on it.  At this level, most of Mage stuff is sensory - it's really a lot like an ESP-based game, where the characters have perceptions beyond the mortal ken, but are just normal people otherwise. <br/><br/>Here are some thoughts:<br/><br/>* Mentors are good, and they fit the apprentice game, but damn, I can't think of anything more boring than 5 people going to see 5 different mentors one after another to get advice on some damn thing, or even worse, 1 mentor for everyone, with no friction at all taking place.  Maybe I could have everyone play the mentor of the person to their left? And maybe scramble up the table every so often?  <br/><br/>* "in over your head" is a good feeling for a while, it creates suspense and exploration of the unknown is a powerful motivator.  But at some point they need to be able to push back. How do I know when is best?<br/><br/>* I think if we do this right after Awakening you can get a lot of good mileage out of your past mundane lives trying to pull you back in, while the occult seeps in at the cracks everywhere you turn, now that you know where to look for it.  This is a good tension. Maybe this is THE main tension of the story.  <br/><br/>Any nonsensical (brain damaged?) stuff you can post would be greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294855/#Comment_294855" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T22:56:29+00:00" title="September 27, 2010 10:56PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2010 10:57PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, there! I'm glad to see you're making the game something closer to what you're looking for.<br/><br/>Why not give them all a single mentor? Alternately, there could be one Big Mojo type in the city that they're all drawn to, keep seeing in their dreams, etc., whose purpose and intentions are vague, weird, or awful. Sort of a Big Bad mixed with an Obi Wan, maybe?<br/><br/>The just-post-Awakening time frame sounds pretty cool - some of the best <i>Vampire </i>advice I got was to milk the first-level powers for all they were worth, and that sounds like what you could accomplish here. There could really be a sort of (maybe you won't like the analogy) <i>Angels and Demons</i> or <i>Fallen </i>sort of feel to a game where the p.c.'s are seers, not thunder-throwers. Especially if there's some really awful juju going on, and they have to use their brains and mundane resources more than magic  to solve problems. This does sort of sound like a different game than <i>M:tA</i> itself, which isn't a bad thing in itself...<br/><br/>One last thing, regarding "in over your head" stuff - - I don't know a damned thing about the game, so maybe you can elaborate as to what motivates the development of greater magic powers. With that in hand, you can consider the route by which the p.c.'s could gain access to push-back power in the first place. If it's a game with lots of tension and horror, then a dramatic powering-up would make more sense than a slow accumulation of mystic knowledge.<br/><br/>[edit] One last thought: what might the p.c.'s have to give up to increase their magical potency?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294907/#Comment_294907" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T08:50:34+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  8:50AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Answered as if I was offered to play at your table (when do I get to learn Correspondence?)

It's probably a lot of juice to ask from your players but you're aiming for teh awesome aren't you? <br/><br/>A single mentor wouldn't be bad. I'd push for some form of friendly competition to become the master's favorite and get to learn more rotes or sth.  \n<blockquote>* "in over your head" is a good feeling for a while, it creates suspense and exploration of the unknown is a powerful motivator.

And add one at each session? Players will have an eye on the progressive ramp up and become bolder step by step? <br/><br/>Or if the power unlock can happen during play it might be nice to be some kind of resource? Say they have one chip at every beginning of a session and... I don't know, something should make the moment special every time a PC unlocks? Could be the trigger or the aftermath. But yeah it should be something meaningful that players remember fondly.   \n<blockquote>* I think if we do this right after Awakening you can get a lot of good mileage out of your past mundane lives trying to pull you back in, while the occult seeps in at the cracks everywhere you turn, now that you know where to look for it.

I'd love to explore the rediscovery of the mundane through paranormal glasses. The old cat lady brewing witches stew in her basement. The hobo who seem to always be around when there's some action. I'd love it if the game started the day before the awakening. Spending maybe 20 minutes in my mundane PC shoes, just for the sake of contrast...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294911/#Comment_294911" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T09:02:53+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  9:02AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are all good suggestions, I am still noodling.<br/><br/>One thing that I might do with the mentor question is to have some central element/theme of the <i>setting</i> and offer 2 mentors that are on opposite sides of it.

They might get offers and threats from odd locations, as people try to take advantage of their naivete.  <br/>--Things to play with in the rules: the Humanity loss rules, you could do some things like in the Dresden Files novels, where the young mages end up doing things that cost them humanity and get them in trouble because they don't know better.  Hard to do that with just one dot in a Sphere, though.<br/>--Other things to play with: the True Name rules, young mages who haven't separated from their old lives and haven't established craft names are going to be really vulnerable to people finding out their True Names and messing with them, or messing with their families and friends.  Even a low level Mage can do all kinds of coincidental stuff to make life difficult for Mundanes.  <br/>--Put some interesting, mysterious stuff in the setting itself.  The rules specifically reward characters for finding out arcane secrets, maybe they can find weird stuff right there in their own back yard<br/>--There is tons of weird stuff for Mage that's really flavorful and could really kick the game up a notch if used sparingly -- throw in a Tremere lich and watch the players stumble all over themselves using incorrect metagaming knowledge.  Or borrow something from one of the other lines or books, the new WOD is a great place for unexplained mysteries or urban legends come to life.<br/>--Or use the Banishers -- they're one of the coolest ideas in the setting.  Having a perfectly nice guy who wants to exterminate you, even though you're a nice guy too, just because you're a mage now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295294/#Comment_295294" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T20:29:54+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  8:29PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played a initial-level Mage game and most of us in fact stuck with easy sensing/viewing/intuiting spells, and occasionally jogging jogging around town to ask other mages for more spell power. (And everyone had magic shields, but y'know what, that's dumb if EVERYONE has shields, but then I'm a fighter so whatever.)<br/><br/>So I mean to say: I think it work just fine for new mages to use there new powers to just figure out the world around them.

You might want to hold that in reserve for when the group has a better grasp of the rules of Mage.  Depends on how much you actually care about following the book.  You could simply do whatever is most fun and the stuff printed be damned; that's up to you.\n<blockquote><br/>* "in over your head" is a good feeling for a while, it creates suspense and exploration of the unknown is a powerful motivator.

You might get some ideas from the spells that Melinda Gordon goes through in Ghost Whisperer where she gets a vision off an object she touches or has a ghost force it on her.  Maybe this is a way of some adversarial Mages trying to force the newly Awakened in one direction or another.  The Exarchs, Veil, and Silver Ladder traditions are good candidates for this kind of thing.  Also creatures from the Shadow World might well have it in their heads to target the Mages, or perhaps some mortal Hunters could work as well.  Task Force Valkyrie or a grass-roots Hunter group if the story takes place in a rural setting like a small-town.  Take small-town cliqueishness and crank up the paranoia level. Could also work in a city depending on what the Mage's backgrounds are.<br/><br/>Part of what the Mages will have to do post-Awakening is to take steps to protect their true names from other Mages.  So some adventures might centre around getting into the various databases where personal information is stored and altering or erasing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
