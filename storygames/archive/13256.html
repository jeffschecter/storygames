One is either a celebration of some external fictional content (<a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Portal:Main" rel="nofollow">Memory Alpha</a> ho!), the other is an affirmation of your own creation.  In other words, if the game privileges what you and your friends create, then the game can't make warp factor matter more or differently than you do on your own, it can't give it more weight than you have decided to give it.

Tactics will be part of the narration.  "We try to lose them in the nebula.  Thanks to Khan's two-dimensional thinking, we're able to then dive down and come up on them from behind."  (Roll conflict.)  Or - "Our ship has 'Warp Drives x5' - we get the hell out of there, and I'm telling the Engineer to give it all she's got."  (Buy extra dice for giving-it-all-she's-got.  After the conflict resolves, even if you win, the adversary will probably add various "Overloaded", "Dilithium crystals blown", "Antimatter core unstable" sorts of traits to your poor ship...)<br/><br/>if you want maps and "we're here, they're there" -<br/>* it costs 1 coin to draw a map.  it costs 1 coin to add an entity to the map or change the position of an entity on the map.<br/><br/>If you want a board game, then<br/>* to resolve tactical situations we switch to battlestations (gimmick) [But then you'd have to come up with rules for converting from Uni to Battlestations and back...]<br/><br/>I think the biggest problem with using Universalis and everyone-plays-a-character might be that someone has to step up and antagonize hard.  Here's an out-of-my-ass gimmick for that:<br/>* each session one officer is an "extra" - his player can't spend coins on his officer, but gets double the coins.<br/>Though at that point you might as well do a game that's already been built for space with a rotating GM, eh.
