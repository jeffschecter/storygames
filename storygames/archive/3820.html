Everyone has a MP3 player on their person, pre-loaded with a 20-song custom playlist assembled by the GMs.  Each player is set to shuffle, and to resolve a conflict you hit next a few times and compare songs.  Success and Outcome is based on comparision of track length (the final digit, specifically), playlist position, and affinities for certain genres and styles determined at character creation.<br/><br/>Another idea in the same vein would actually be to have a central location (GM desk) where a stereo is playing a random set of music.  Every character (or faction?) has an affinity to a certain style of music, and their success and outcome versus other affinities is based on whatever song is currently playing.  Different characters could have abilities to pause, repeat, skip, stop, etc the music, and perhaps satellite locations could be set up, with different chances of outcome based on proximity, clash, and so on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85805/#Comment_85805" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T10:56:47+00:00" title="August  6, 2007 10:56AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2007 10:58AM by Graham.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's genius. I really like both of those. <br/><br/>I'll probably steal the second one. You could definitely say "Whenever a romantic song is playing, you may seduce anyone by speaking to them for two minutes" or similar.<br/><br/>Skipping the music is a really powerful power. That stereo should be set to shuffle, too, so when you skip the music, it's a calculated risk, and you're not sure what you're going to get.<br/><br/>Oh...now...having said that. You could organise the playlist so that the most dramatic powers were triggered by the end of the playlist, giving a rather lovely structure to the game. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85808/#Comment_85808" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T11:05:51+00:00" title="August  6, 2007 11:05AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite><br/>Skipping the music is a really powerful power.

I'm still in the proto-design stage on both ideas, but I see a lot of potential for a faction within the second game to have control over the tone and flow of the game.  I see the design of the system being fairly straightforward.  Figuring out what the game is all about now, that's a different beast.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_video" rel="nofollow">Kid Video</a> the LARP, perhaps?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85816/#Comment_85816" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T11:24:20+00:00" title="August  6, 2007 11:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I was thinking it would be perfect if I did another Meat Loaf LARP.<br/><br/>But, really, anything with associated music.

Say you have two groups of players in two separate "time bubbles" of actions (aka, two separate initiatve instances).  Both instances could easily feature people who affect the play of the music to affect the happenings of the instances in which they are involved, and this could lead to clashing over which takes precedence.<br/><br/>Then again, it could be encouraged as such, with a focal point of the mechanics being that there are always others than yourself affecting the music, and when you affect the music youaffect it for everyone else as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86025/#Comment_86025" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T04:35:40+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  4:35AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86059/#Comment_86059" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T07:48:56+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  7:48AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually just ordered a small lot of 128mb MP3 players to test out theory number 1.
