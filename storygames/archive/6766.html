By which I mean, "this is what I mean when I say those two words."  They may or may not match up to your definitions of them, but that's okay.  I'm talking about what *I* mean by them.<br/><br/>This is a debate:<br/>"I am arguing that X is true.  Here are reasons Y that X is true."<br/>"I am arguing that X is false.  Here are reasons Z that X is false."<br/>"X is true.  Here are reasons A, B, and C that Z are fallacious/peripheral/irrelevant and blahblahblah."<br/><br/>This is a discussion:<br/>"Here's my observations of/experiences with X.  They have led me to conclude Y.  What are your observations of/experiences with X?  What are your thoughts on Y?"<br/>"Well, here's my observations of X, which have led me to conclude Z.  I find that Y does not make sense, due to my own observations A, B, and C.  What are your thoughts on Z?"<br/>"Actually, Z makes a lot of sense and blahblahblah."<br/><br/>I have learned so many things from discussion that I can't even count them.  Nearly every time I discuss something, I learn something new.  Because of this, I like discussion.<br/><br/>I have not learned one damned thing from debate, except how to debate.  Every time I debate something, I get angry and flustered, and I feel like ripping people's throats out with my teeth.  Because of this, I don't like debate.<br/><br/>Anyone want to discuss?

Those are pretty common. When one person is really trying to get the other to expand upon their opinion to better understand it, and the other thinks it's some kind of trick to maneuver them into an indefensible position, the whole thing hurts like amateur dentistry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one person is trying to maneuver the other into an indefensible position, and the other is trying to better explain their position to foster understanding, it's just as painful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are very much things that are nice to be able to avoid, but apart from "forcing" people to flat out state their intent, I have no idea how to do so. The best I can do is, when I realized I've been tricked into a conversation that the other person viewed as a debate, I thank them and politely bow out as fast as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's very much not a gaming thing, or even a forum thing -- I have a good friend that I've realized I am much better friends with if I simply politely avoid discussion of things that he and I disagree on, because he cannot distinguish the two. I've watched my wife defeat his layered, complex arguments with four words:<br/>\n<br/>\n"I see your point."<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the poor guy just <i>deflates</i>, because he was just in it for the debate. The thing is, though, he doesn't realize he's in it for the debate. He's surprised every time that happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150446/#Comment_150446" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T09:10:15+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  9:10AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I largely agree.<br><br>I'd prefer to blur the lines a little: I learn things from debates, but generally not as much as I learn from discussion.<br><br>Also, it's difficult to distinguish exactly between the two, because the tones in which a discussion are conducted can often be taken <i>either</i> as debate or discussion.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150449/#Comment_150449" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T09:21:20+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  9:21AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 9:23AM by Matt Snyder.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's something I noticed about debate (I'm cool with your terms Debate and Discussion).<br><br>When debate happens, identity politics intervene almost every fucking time. Ok, every fucking time. I'm guilty of it myself, which is another story (I'll discuss that if you want). <br><br>Anyway, whether I participate or observe these kind of debates, I noticed something. The people involved make their impression on MANY other people. It's my own squishy law, and a way that keeps me out of this noise any more these days:<br><br>Whenever someone makes me throat-ripping, teeth-gnashing mad, I should sit back. INEVITABLY they will earn a reputation, good or ill. Whether they "win" or not really isn't the issue. They earn something anyway. In essence, they "get what they deserve" in my view. These things tend to shake out pretty well. <br/><br/>The key is to look at it over the long term. If someone harps over and over and over again about how stinky-poo-poo the Forge is, eventually they get "heard." And, people very frequently act accordingly. And, maybe that same person has some brilliant shit to lay down. They get "heard" on that, too. Even if it takes more effort. It just takes time.<br/><br/>It's poetic justice, if you will. It ain't perfect. But it does tend to lower my blood pressue.<br/><br/>Oh, make no mistake. I'm the benefactor and the sufferer of my own goofy little law. Lots of people think I recently "got what I deserved" and hope I get more of it. More power to 'em. Maybe it'll lower their blood pressure. We can't hug everyone. I sure as hell don't.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150450/#Comment_150450" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T09:34:41+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  9:34AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweeney,<br/>Yes, I totally agree; those sort of things match up to my own experiences.

If I'm not interested in what you have to say, I'm not going to talk with you.  No, not even to be polite.  I think it's pretty profoundly disingenuous to fake like you're interested when you're not, even and especially in the name of being polite.  Why do I need to tell you that, when I talk with you, I'd like you to talk as well?<br/><br/>I am incapable of stating absolute truth.  So are you.  The words we utter have no direct interface with reality.  Everything that comes out of my mouth is processed through my experience.

He's demonstrated to me over many posts that he actually really understands the design principles underlying games like Sorcerer, Dogs in the Vineyard, My Life with Master, etc.  So when he offers a descenting opinion I actually listen and respect what he says because he's actually proven to me that he understands what he's descenting from.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150523/#Comment_150523" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T11:53:44+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 11:53AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>If I'm talking with you, then I'm interested in what you have to say.

The pragmatic reality is that if you want to have a productive discussion about the ideas that interest you, instead of an interminable debate about whether or not you're an asshole or  a one-true-way fanatic, you take a moment to state that you respect others' views, and that what you're saying is opinion and not fact.

Er, I mean to say, your opinion here coincides with my own. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>When this extra little bit of effort gets used, there's at least the hope that you avoid exchanges where someone goes, "You're wrong" and I'm like "That's interesting, I'm curious how your experiences with that have differed with mine" and then you go back and forth for a bit and then it turns out the other guy just wanted to say "You're wrong" and he didn't really have anything else to add. What he meant by "You're wrong" is "I think you're a doodoo-head" and not "I think you've missed some other factor that could make a difference in your assessment."<br/><br/>So while I know that if your name's above your comments then they represent your opinion, taking the time to level-set and acknowledge that <i>you</i> realize your opinions are opinions is helpful. Because if you don't, and you think "Chocolate is bad" is a statement of fact, then I need to know that so I can just not engage you in conversation. <br/><br/>And yes, this is mostly when it comes to internet conversations. Whether it's body language or just the speed of face-to-face communication, determining whether you can actually have a conversation with someone or if they're just there to be a dick happens much faster offline. Sometimes before the conversation starts, even.<br/><br/>(By the way, another weird thing about the difference between online and offline discourse: I was oddly engaged in the conversation just by someone using my <i>name</i>. That tells me I really should consider ditching my standard pseudonym and go with that, at least for this forum.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150544/#Comment_150544" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T12:38:15+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:38PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            nor does it fix anything, if you have offensive or wrong opinions then they are still offensive or wrong in my book . <br/>\n<br/>\nI think "debate" is getting the short end of the stick, I don't think people are looking at "here is the cometitive discussion aimed at convincing others" and "the non competitive disussion aimed at convincing ourselfs" so much as here is the thing that i did have a good time with and here is the thing i didn't have a good time with.

Debate is for the benefit of the audience. Unless you have an audience you wish to benefit, then, you're better off engaging in discussion.</blockquote>\nThis may be one of those situations where I've internalized too much literary theory.  I don't really draw a distinction between participant and audience.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>The big distinction that I was making is that debate is a game that looks like discourse.  The others are that in my debate, the evidence is chosen to match the point, and the point does not change, while in my discussion, the conclusion exists only in the context of experience and observation, and may be subject to change during the process of communication.</blockquote>\nThe "point" is always open to change.  Maybe not <em>right there at the instance of speaking</em>, but nobody walks into a debate thinking that they'll walk out thinking and believing exactly the same things as when they walked in \u2014 and if they are, they're either naive or deaf.<br/><br/>So too, anybody who walks into a "debate" and treats it like a game is being an asshole.  Presumably, you enter into a debate to talk about the things that you care about.  Presumably, the other people participating also care about this topic.  If you enter into the debate merely to outmaneuver them, especially when you know that this is something that they really care about, you're taking their beliefs and using them like playthings.<br/><br/>Are you typifying "discussion" as a collaborative attempt by all the participants to reach the truth together, and a "debate" as a competitive affair where the participants try to prove their side is the truth (and therefore one or more must be wrong and therefore spouting falsehoods if not lies)?<br/><br/>Something like Jesse is asserting here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>The goal of debate is to prove or deny the validity of a given assertion.  The purpose of discussion is to come to a point of mutual understanding if not agreement.  The ability to articulate back to the other participant their own view in your own words is *vital* to discussion.</blockquote>\nIf so, I think you're selling "debate" short.  There are a ton of levels of social interactions involved that are getting elided, ignored, and assumed irrelevant if debate is merely a game where you prove your point without considering to the other side beyond how to rebut them.<br/><br/>Michael \u2014 I understand that you are justifiably wary of participating in a new community where the entrenched members may be rude to a newcomer or dissident.  Is the members' being rude the same thing as being in a debate?  I mean, it is possible to debate without resorting to calling the opposing side an idiot, right?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>What I'm getting at with the observations/experiences thing is the explanation and analysis of <b>why</b> you conclude something.  Because it might be something that I or someone else has not considered.</blockquote>\nOkay, so if there's a thing that you haven't considered that may better explain my point to you, and I fail to present that thing, then I have failed \u2014 even under the terms of your debate-as-heartless-game definition.  That's just crap-ass debating, is what that is.  If it's useful, if it's relevant, if it contributes to the consideration of the topic at hand, then it should be aired.  That it isn't doesn't turn a discussion into a debate.  It just means the topic is not being considered as completely as it could be.<br/><br/>(more, because I'm a wordy bastard)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150564/#Comment_150564" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T13:02:45+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  1:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my thing, right: I can be (as you can see above) somewhat confrontational when it comes to talking about things that are important to me.  This is because I have found, over my life experience, that people are very happy to repeat blithe assumptions to each other instead of actively seek for a better understanding.  The only thing that gets past passing platitudes back and forth is challenging those platitudes.  That challenge can come from the outside world, when reality batters down everything you hold dear, or it can come from your conversation partners who call you on the assumptions that you make.<br/><br/>Challenges to your assumptions are uncomfortable when you're used to passing platitudes back and forth.  Sometimes, people get defensive and try to paint challenges as bad \u2014 invasive, disrespectful, even rude.  And that's lame.  That's turtling away from life.  But worse, that's contagious.  Other people pick it up, and then you get whole choruses demonizing what is, at root, the practice of saying, "Hey, what you just said conflicts with what I have experienced."  And once you have that environment, then the popularity contests begin and the ideogogues move in, knowing that they can sway people's opinions easily since they won't actually be challenged.<br/><br/>Debate, challenging others, presenting a well-constructed and well-supported argument, and all the rest are important, foundational principles that allow us to actually communicate.  They are only uncomfortable when you mistake a challenge as an attack.  But the thing of it is, once somebody goes on the attack, they're not debating any more.  They're just being an asshole.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So I don't know if this is a worthwhile response, Marshall.  I don't really want to "discuss" your distinction between discussion and debate if that means nodding and agreeing and not challenging what I see as a naive and potentially destructive distinction.  If challenging your position is debating, and you're not interested in debating, I really don't know what I'm supposed to do here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150565/#Comment_150565" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T13:04:00+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  1:04PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 1:05PM by Matt Snyder.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeffrey, I like being blunt, too.

That people shouldn't be solipsist assholes online?  Yeah, I pretty much agree with that!<br/><br/>As far as the other levels of social interactions, a debate is easy to consider as merely a game when you are looking at it as a discrete thing unrelated to anything else.  When you put it in a context, however, everything changes.<br/><br/>For instance, a school debate club, to take Jesse's example, is: (a) teaching students rhetorical rigour, (b) introducing students to "important" issues of the day, (c) coaxing students to express their own beliefs, (d) getting students to comprehend beliefs that they do not share enough so that they can defend them in a debate (the classic "all the students that agree with the pro statement debate for the con statement"), (e) getting students to socialize in a medium that isn't about sex or violence, (f) allowing students to network in their communities, (g) introducing students to political organizations related to the issues being debated... and the list goes on and on.  If a student walks out of a semester in debate club without having changed at all, that's been a pretty disastrous debate club.<br/><br/>In the same vein, talking about a single thread on a single forum as a debate and decrying it as destructive or useless is not seeing it in the broader context of the "community of gamers" across the globe communicating with each other.  Consider any hotly-contested thread on RPGnet inevitably results in sales \u2014 which is nice for the designer, sure, but that means that <em>that thread got people thinking</em>, at least enough to check out a new game.  Threads spin off private messages and email discussions.  Threads may even inspire new games and books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150576/#Comment_150576" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T13:34:50+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  1:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would add: if I am wrong about something, I would rather someone say "you are wrong, here are 100 reasons why, now stop it" than "that is an interesting point of view good sir how did you come to such a fascinating belief".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150580/#Comment_150580" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T13:39:02+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  1:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 1:39PM by Josh Roby.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I'm <em>right</em> about something, I would rather someone say, "You are wrong, here are 100 reasons why, now stop it," than "That is an interesting point of view, good, sir; how did you come to such a fascinating belief?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tork" title="tork"><img alt="tork" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tork">tork</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150582/#Comment_150582" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T13:48:22+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  1:48PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 1:49PM by tork.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Marshall, if you're not talking about the perils of debate, then I don't know what you're talking about.</blockquote>\nI don't want to put words in Marshall's mouth, but here's my take:<br/><br/>I think you can broadly characterize debates as discussions with a win state. (Though they don't always have to end in victory for one side or the other.)  Internet debates generally come in two flavors; discussions where the win state is converting another to your point of view, and discussions where the win state is silencing all dissenters, either by flummoxing them with rhetorical brilliance or driving them off through frustration or boredom.<br/><br/>I think the former is perfectly fine; vigorous debate can be a lot of fun, and really interesting insights sometimes arise from it.  The latter, on the other hand, is just a waste of time, and left unchecked, can destroy an internet community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150587/#Comment_150587" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T14:03:36+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  2:03PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            tork,<br/><br/>I basically agree.  I think the value of debates on the internet is never to directly, then-and-there, change someone's mind.  That almost never happens.  And a debate that ends in silence sucks too (which seems to have occurred on this forum today -- which is a shame).  However, debates do have a value.  They challenge ideas and slay sacred cows.  They destroy echo chambers and circle jerks of muddled ideas.  If a people can't submit their ideas to vigorous debate with folks who passionately disagree, so much the worse for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150592/#Comment_150592" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T14:23:49+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  2:23PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pardon me as I ramble a bit, each sentence being a different thought as I think about the recent "fighty" threads:<br/><br/>* Bludgeoning others with truth isn't the way things happen** here. As everyone knows, "wrong opinions" won't get people shut down, thrown out, banned, etc.  But being a dick when expressing yourself, on either side, will.<br/><br/>* Disagreements are awesome, and generate fruitful debate as long as everyone can stop and remember that they're talking to a person.<br/><br/>* It always seems that when this people use this place as a theory discussion ground, that these kinds of things happen. <br/>--We're focused on play over design: We're not seeking to duplicate the effort of The Forge. That message is out, which is good.<br/>--We're focused on practice over theory: We're not seeking to make this a place to reopen those closed theory discussion forums.. That message is out, to some degree...<br/>...yet it seems that the most times I see people get angry, fed up, bitter, start swaggering, bullying, denying etc is when theory raises its head here.<br/>--I'm not going to go so far as to "ban theory" or whatever, because there's a lot of tangential subjects that are totally awesome for looking at the way the dice hit the table.<br/>--Also, give it a week, and those discussions will be forgotten. The nature of a forum and all that. Internet biorhythm. <br/>--Yet, I still feel like doing something, to minimize the impact of those shit-flavored theory discussion cookies that creep up every once in a while.<br/>--I'm thinking a knife-fight style "share your vignettes. that's all you are allowed to do, talk about an experience which actually happened to you, and not to have a raging debate where everyone eventually forgets what the point of the discussion was in the first place" might be a good thing to use next time we have a dip in the biorhythm and more abstract theory comes up.<br/><br/>* In the end, discussion or debate, as the moderator here I don't mind either (though I prefer an agenda of "discussion" over "debate", if people can miraculously navigate through such a discussion without reaching for war-pikes). I just mind it when people act like bitter assholes. There's just no place for that here. I haven't seen that happen with the recent threads, but I've seen it get close. That makes me sad, because when that level gets hit, it means that it's like, somewhere, a countdown timer is set for that person to eventually leave (fed up with the place) or get banned (for totally going off the deep end), usually the former, and that trail is almost always paved with grief.<br/><br/>Aaaanyway, just some thoughts.

If a people can't submit their ideas to vigorous debate with folks who passionately disagree, so much the worse for them.</blockquote>\nMy challenge (in a sense of "issue that I'm looking at resolving/doing something with") is that I really like a lot of what you have to say. I mean, I read through the rest of that thread, and I found myself agreeing with you on every point. Like, Every. Friggin. One. Everway? Shit, that game is like Rule Zero wrapped up with collectible cards and pretty art ("Take Damage? Well, let the GM decide what that means for your character".  In the end, though, the tone got a bit abrasive. <br/><br/>Asshole? No. Folks disengaged, though. And I thought there was a lot of ground to cover still. And I can't help but to feel that if "X" happened (what is "X"? That's my challenge, I guess) that we could have all continued discussing the implications of your thoughts further, without a lot of folks feeling the need to draw lines, separate themselves from the discussion, etc.<br/><br/>I'm not picking on you, mind. Sometimes I see Snyder, or Valamir hit the same thing: Like, "Man, if only they approached things a little more delicately, or something... maybe the discussion could have continued".<br/><br/>I dunno. I hate to think that talking with others on the internet in a way that keeps people engaged despite having contrary viewpoints isn't like blowing glass or soldering circuits on a motherboard or something else delicate and time-consuming.<br/><br/>So what's X? That's my challenge. Jeffery taking a softer stance while stating the same points? Or me requesting that everyone only speak about their own experiences in real life (here with Rule Zero or whatever)? Or recognizing that the debate moved away from the table and into the world of theory moon logic where people debate for logic's sake and not remembering why the discussion started?  Or just ignoring it, recognizing that, like all such small molehills, people get over it after a week or two, and by the next year it's forgotten. That's what I need help with, I think.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150601/#Comment_150601" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T14:56:51+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  2:56PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeffrey Straszheim</cite>However, debates do have a value.

I'm trying to find the last time I said this, because I said it better then... but in the end, I'm (that is me, Moderator) walking a tightrope of sorts.<br/><br/>I feel very strongly that "challenging", and "destroying" should be happening... But Not *Here* on Story-Games. I'm simply not interested in turning this place here into an abattoir. <br/><br/>Also, note that with challenging ideas and the like, most of that is tied up with capital-T Theory (there's really not much to challenge or destroy when talking about 4e combat map counters, or swapping practical game advice for the table: "Yes, But" etc.). Which is why that it's been so historically easy to say, "Here at S-G we're about talking about game play, not challenging each other's ideas and destroying false beliefs". Because most of that stuff was tied to things that don't get brought up anyway when no one discusses Theory.*<br/><br/>Theory doesn't really have any place on these forums: I've stated from day one that I'd rather nuke this place than turn it into The Place Where We Can Talk Theory Now That Those Forums on the Forge Are Shut Down. To me, personally, it really isn't interesting. And on a whole, most of it is aimed at designers and not even players. Even the Rule Zero stuff we've seen lately, much of that debate was about the design of such games. The more personal vignettes of "this is how I saw X in play at my table" (the OP from the "My friend Travis" thread, frex) is the only part of Theory worth discussing here; and it's not even so much discussing, as swapping stories.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* It's like how most people get banned from RPGNet for stuff they say in Tangency about some political or social idea or other; if things were more focused on gaming, less people would be pissed off at RPGNet with stories like: <br/>A: "Man, those guys just are a circle jerk of like-minded posters!"<br/>B: "Why, what happened?"<br/>A: "Well, I was arguing with this dude about Zionism and Conservative Christianity, and he started spouting shit that was false, so I had to correct him. But the mods wouldn't listen to my side of the debate. I upset the status quo, and got banned".<br/>B: "So you got banned because of a political debate."<br/>A: "Yep. Cliques of like-minded fools."<br/>B: "...uh, and what the fuck did that have to do with RPGs?"<br/><br/>That's kind of how I see things go when theory gets discussed here. Maybe not cause and effect, but some kind of association. Lines get drawn, people get bitter, become accusatory or quick-to-temper, because of debates that, were I to enforce some kind of No Theory law or something (which I won't, mind you; the play-focused stuff can be solid and fun to talk about), would never have existed in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150607/#Comment_150607" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T15:20:37+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  3:20PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no idea what X might be -- perhaps Val, Christopher, Morano, and I could have whispered to each other, at least the more controversial parts.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure I'd make a terrible moderator <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Focusing on actual play is a great idea, of course.

I know you find such language phony and annoying, but do you enjoy discussions where people shut down and withdraw instead of engaging with your ideas?  What about having people attack you, or the way you communicate, instead of attacking your ideas?  Is that fun, or is it annoying?  If it is annoying, which would detract more from your enjoyment of the discussion; prefacing a post with "In my opinion," or listening to a bunch of people rant about things that have nothing to do with what you have to say?<br/><br/>I was a really big "pure and noble art of debate" guy in my early usenet days, but I eventually came to the realization that by softening my stance a bit, I could have really satisfying debates that never required me to write 15 different posts in the same damn thread pointing out that I had never once written even a single sentence dismissing someone's play experience as juvenile or invalid.

The idea that if it has no value, it's self correcting - it just goes away very quickly.<br/><br/>So when people have posted, I've assumed they've found some value in it. But I assumed wrong - many people were posting to threads they found absolutely no value in. And I was responding in 'Okay, lets talk about the value you found...'. <br/><br/>To me, theory is about practicality - take from posts what, if anything, you find useful. If you think you can get something more from it by posting, that's a reason to post.

I often remind myself that the person in-person is probably a lot different than the person posting. And I've come off like an ass online before, so I know how people can read something you write and take it the wrong way. In general, what you suggested is what I've been doing. Ignoring the negative. But it can get frustrating.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150731/#Comment_150731" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T08:54:10+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  8:54AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh,<br/>Dude, you can put the fiery sword down <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  From what I can tell, we agree about everything here except the terminology I used.  Which is a non-issue; that's why I made a point of saying that "this is what I mean when I say 'debate.'"  I'm not talking about anything else called debate, just the thing that I used the label "debate" to refer to.  And that thing is a thing that I'm against mainly because I am opposed to throat-ripping on general principles, and I find throat-ripping to be very closely related to it.  If it has redeeming features (as several posts have pointed out already), well, that's good.  I didn't know about that before, and now I do.<br/><br/>And I never meant that "discussion" had to be full of platitudes and niceties.  It's okay to say, "That just plain makes no sense."  But I think it's better to say, "That just plain makes no sense, because of [insert experiences &amp; observations here that led to that conclusion]."  There's no need for, "That was a great point, sir, but blahblahblah." <br/><br/>-Marshall                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

Shit, that game is like Rule Zero wrapped up with collectible cards and pretty art ("Take Damage? Well, let the GM decide what that means for your character".  In the end, though, the tone got a bit abrasive.<br/><br/>Asshole? No. Folks disengaged, though. And I thought there was a lot of ground to cover still. And I can't help but to feel that if "X" happened (what is "X"? That's my challenge, I guess) that we could have all continued discussing the implications of your thoughts further, without a lot of folks feeling the need to draw lines, separate themselves from the discussion, etc.<br/><br/>I'm not picking on you, mind. Sometimes I see Snyder, or Valamir hit the same thing: Like, "Man, if only they approached things a little more delicately, or something... maybe the discussion could have continued".</blockquote>\nThis is gold. The dialog is full of problems. Noting this--calling it out as it is done here--is excellent.

Too much noise. Too much bickering. Too many people trying to win arguments. My personal Zen is being crushed. Like, I will never play 4th. I may one day read 4th, but probably not, I'm guessing I'll get what I need simply by reading people rave about it. However, most of the threads about 4th have turned into total Zen-harshers for me. Same for the rule zero threads and a few others. And these aren't topics that disinterest me, but the approach the posters take is painful to me. It's lead to me skipping almost every post and only stopping on a few posters, who I recognize for saying insightful things in the past, to read their comments. It means I get to skip over people who I know aren't going to contribute anything I find valuable (for whatever reason), but it also means I end up skipping over people I am unfamiliar with but who may contribute something interesting. But my Zen has been so badly beaten up here recently I'm afraid to read posters I don't recognize.<br/><br/>Leading into... my love of Ignore features. They turned a site that was once painful to me into easy reading by letting me ignore just a few peeps, generally people who are in it to win it, and allowing me to read a thread from top to bottom without doing any scanning (because once I start scanning I don't scan to skip people I don't enjoy reading, I scan to find people I do enjoy reading). I don't think Vanilla even has an Ignore feature (also, I realize some people find the idea of Ignore features offensive) so I wouldn't expect it to be added on, but I dream of it all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151033/#Comment_151033" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T11:09:13+00:00" title="June 16, 2008 11:09AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2008 11:09AM by Josh Roby.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>How do you know whether someone has something valuable to contribute without reading the post?</blockquote>\nOh, I uh... hard to explain.  I read the post, evaluate it for it being valuable, and then put it in the context of the rest of the thread.  If it fails the value check, it doesn't get put into the context of the thread.
