I don't imagine many people are familiar with this awesome little game and  I can't seem to get much help from other forums, so here goes.<br/><br/>For those of you unfamiliar with the card game, look here:<br/><a href="http://rynaga.blogspot.com/p/iconica.html" rel="nofollow">http://rynaga.blogspot.com/p/iconica.html</a><br/><br/>The creator, Eric Torres, has built a huge background for the card game. Very rich in detail and a perfect background for a Roleplaying game. He also shares a couple of maps:<br/><a href="http://www.rynaga.com/maps/rynaga_webmap1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rynaga.com/maps/rynaga_webmap1.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://www.rynaga.com/maps/rynaga_webmap2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rynaga.com/maps/rynaga_webmap2.pdf</a><br/><br/>The card game uses character cards that are kinda like archetypes, but no character stats or anything like that. <br/>Instead, you get a little portrait, a little background about the character's archetype, race or region of origin, etc.<br/>Then Health and abilities.<br/>The rules and a couple of sample cards can be found below, to give you an idea of the mechanics of the card game:<br/><a href="http://rynaga.blogspot.com/p/iconica-rules.html" rel="nofollow">http://rynaga.blogspot.com/p/iconica-rules.html</a><br/><a href="http://rynaga.blogspot.com/p/iconica...y-sampler.html" rel="nofollow">http://rynaga.blogspot.com/p/iconica...y-sampler.html</a><br/><br/>Ultimately, I want to use the card game as a combat resolution system within the Roleplaying game, but I want to be able to use the character cards during the roleplaying side of things as well, probably by adding minor stats or cleverly using what's already on the cards.<br/><br/>I want to run a short campaign where the players can do lots of exploring and discover the different factions of the World of Rynaga, etc...<br/>I'm just at a loss as to where to start. I don't need a complex resolution mechanic or anything like that... Just need enough to fit with the character cards of the card game.<br/><br/>If you can think of simple mechanics that I could look into and that seem to be a fit with the themes of exploration of new and strange lands, foreign customs, translating old text. Those would be the most common things I would have PCs do.<br/>It may also help me if you have a bunch of questions about the game to help me realize stuff about it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster" title="Alabaster"><img alt="Alabaster" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster">Alabaster</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277432/#Comment_277432" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T04:23:43+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  4:23AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The art is so good.

What would it take to play it as an RPG?<br/><br/>I'm just at a loss as to where to start...<br/><br/>I figured that character creation would begin with picking an Archetype (i.e. one of the cards) then maybe rolling some stats relevant to everything outside of combat, such as exploration, the study of ancient and new cultures, etc...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster" title="Alabaster"><img alt="Alabaster" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alabaster">Alabaster</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277460/#Comment_277460" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T08:17:06+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  8:17AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Fate system would probably be easiest for plugging in a variety of new skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nihilistic%20Mind" title="Nihilistic Mind"><img alt="Nihilistic Mind" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nihilistic%20Mind">Nihilistic Mind</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277487/#Comment_277487" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T09:49:22+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  9:49AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd certainly be interested in a simplistic (read general and short) skill list.

Let's call it ETIQUETTE.<br/>-Broad knowledge such as General History and Geography. (Not sure what to call this yet).<br/>-Wilderness survival skills (should include some sort of tracking). Let's call it SURVIVAL.<br/>-Decrypting ancient texts, secret ciphers. Let's call it CIPHER.<br/>-Exploring any of the following (should include map-making): wild places, ruins of ancient civilization, enemy camps. I expect this to be equivalent to "careful information gathering", since these explorative situations should be quite dangerous. Let's call it EXPLORATION.<br/>-There should also be some sort of all encompassing SPY skill (Stealthy actions, poisoning, disguise)... that sort of stuff. Let's call it SPY.<br/><br/>I'll think of other things as it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nihilistic%20Mind" title="Nihilistic Mind"><img alt="Nihilistic Mind" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nihilistic%20Mind">Nihilistic Mind</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277697/#Comment_277697" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T11:47:40+00:00" title="June 24, 2010 11:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, thinking about this some more.<br/>There should also be a skill that encompasses knowledge of Flora and Fauna, and things like obtaining poisons and toxins from plants, insects and beasts. <br/>Or do you think it is not necessary and would be encompassed by the Survival (knowing which beasts and plants have poison or toxins that can be extracted) and Spy (since it involves the use and application of Poisons)?<br/><br/>I'll keep reading the information on the cards and try to come up with a system of some kind.<br/><br/>I am also trying to think of a way to use the game pieces and dice that come with the card game. <br/>The game already comes with a white die and a black die; both are six-siders. <br/>The game also come with small wooden cubes used as markers for the card during play; six each of: black, orange, green, purple, blue and white marker.<br/><br/>Perhaps rolling the white die for positive and the black die for negative, then add your skill rank to beat a Target Number matching the difficulty?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
