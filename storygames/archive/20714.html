On one hand, it's a wildly reckless "sport", and I'm not sure I'd recommend anyone to participate in it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it seems like perhaps the most 'realistic' portrayal of armoured medieval combat you're likely to find anywhere. (If you want a short segment, start watching at 14:40.)<br/><br/>It's also pretty interesting to see the effectiveness of armour. I notice that they don't employ any heavy crushing weapons (e.g. maces, mauls, hammers) or impaling weapons like spears, but otherwise, even heavy blows from an axe or a polearm (at one point someone misses and strikes the wooden barrier marking the edge of the territory, and the axe goes very deep into the wood; you see some significant dents in the armour, etc - no one's holding their punches here!) are relatively "safe" (enough for people to participate in several matches in a row, in any case).<br/><br/>Note that it is not truly "no-holds-barred" fighting. They DO have some rules, minimal as they may be.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to watch this kind of thing on a larger, open terrain, so tactics and positioning would come into play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455037/#Comment_455037" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-12T05:16:14+00:00" title="July 12, 2016  5:16AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2016 5:24AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a fairly reasonable summary of the rules:\n<blockquote>The object is to put everyone on the other team to the ground and have someone on you team still standing. You may strike with weapons, shield,  punch, kick, trip, tackle, push, shove, and grapple. All weapons must <br/>be steel and blunt. All armor must be steel. All armor and weapons must be analogous to historical examples. No thrusting/stabbing. That's pretty much it.\ufeff</blockquote>\n(This person omits the weight restriction on weapons, as well. That's necessary for obvious reasons, I would think!)<br/><br/>One interesting detail:<br/><br/>The lack of sharp, stabbing weapons means that a formation like a shield wall is not effective: a few teams tried it and discovered that it can be simply charged and easily taken down (!!!). So it seems that the true value of a shield wall is not in its defensive strength, but in the danger of getting stabbed as you approach - well before you get a chance to get past the shields to take down an opponent.<br/><br/>An interesting illustration from a medieval book, showing how to negate armour:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-86ad3c608579f140e6b8fbc3af4777ae-c?convert_to_webp=true"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455039/#Comment_455039" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-12T07:29:03+00:00" title="July 12, 2016  7:29AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2016 6:36PM by Rickard.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check with <a href="http://www.thearma.org/" rel="nofollow">ARMA</a> if you want to get in contact with people that tries to reconstruct old fighting techniques.

It's more about taking charge and keep that initiative.</li><li>All weapons are made to kill people. It's more about excessive damage and reach than doing 1d4 or 1d10 in damage. Skill &gt; damage.</li><li>Your other hand is a weapon that supports your main weapon, no matter if it's unarmed, wearing a shield or, in some cases, a dagger or slightly bigger weapon. You can grab with your free hand, or hit/tackle/lock with your shield.</li><li>With armor, it's possible to be more aggressive because it leaves less areas to get hit on.</li><li>You can move kinda freely with full plate armor. The only restriction is that you get winded more easily, and a somewhat slower acceleration.</li><li>You rarely penetrate armor, unless having specific weapons or attachments, but you try instead to find places where the armor has gaps, like the armpit, throat, groin, knees. If you trip your opponent, and starts to  wrestle, then you can draw your dagger and stick it where the armor wont protect. Again: skill &gt; damage.</li><li>More detailed rules is more likely to give more weight the wrong things, making the system less realistic.</li><li>Fighting multiple  opponents is about maneuvering to make it one versus one anyway.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455054/#Comment_455054" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-12T17:29:15+00:00" title="July 12, 2016  5:29PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's amazing Rickard! ever seen/used this on a game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455057/#Comment_455057" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-12T20:58:43+00:00" title="July 12, 2016  8:58PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that all of those things are quite visible in that video (at least, they stood out to me).<br/><br/>I've read elsewhere that in armoured medieval combat there were relatively few casualties. Most people were killed in transit (starvation, disease, etc), and, more relevantly, after the battle, as the winners would often "finish" off the downed soldiers of their enemy.<br/><br/>Many (most?) single combats between armoured knights ended as a wrestling match, on the ground, until one of them found a gap in the other's armour and slid a dagger through. Armour was surprisingly effective in this sense!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455107/#Comment_455107" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-15T12:02:14+00:00" title="July 15, 2016 12:02PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That's amazing Rickard! ever seen/used this on a game?</blockquote>\nWell, I made the research when building my swashbuckling game <b>Matin\xe9</b>.

A good post by <a href="/forums/profile/emarsk">@emarsk</a> :\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/emarsk" rel="nofollow">emarsk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Adam, HEMA stands for <i>Historical European Martial Arts</i>.<br/>It's quite a broad term, but at its core it means reconstructing how to fight with historical weapons, basing the teachings on historical treatises as much as possible.<br/>Most of HEMA is unarmoured sword fighting (for choice of interest, practical reasons, and also because most historical treatises we have are about that).<br/>In my club we study longsword, sidesword, Italian rapier and Italian duelling sabre.<br/><br/>Here are some examples of sparring, just to get an idea of how a sword duel could look like:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bIu5EC8BIs" rel="nofollow">longsword</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24oovNv7vY" rel="nofollow">rapier and dagger</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhiFCYwSG40" rel="nofollow">sword and buckler</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx6snU_IRSU" rel="nofollow">sword and shield</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuJ9ACn_a20" rel="nofollow">sidesword</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fbnsN2mBCU" rel="nofollow">broadsword</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlIUrd7d1Q" rel="nofollow">in plate armour</a><br/><br/>I think it's quite easy to realise that RPG combat rules that try to simulate blow-for-blow are doomed to fail; a more abstract approach can actually lead to - or at least allow - a more realistic narration.<br/><br/>There also also a lot of misconceptions, some of which could be easily fixed, some not, for example:<br/></p><ul>\n<li>you need strength to use a longsword: <i>it weights about 1.5kg, strength is always useful in a fight (and grappling is always an option) but what you need most is training first, and then dexterity</i><br/></li><li>you need dexterity to use a bow: <i>here you actually need a lot of strength: a longbow could have a draw of 70kg!</i><br/></li><li>dagger vs. longsword have equal chance to hit, but the longsword delivers more damage: <i>a stab with a dagger would kill you just like a thrust with a sword, but hitting with a short weapon against a long one is much more difficult</i><br/></li><li>arming swords are heavy and rapiers are light: <i>they both weigh about 1kg or slightly more</i><br/></li><li>armoured fighting is like unarmoured fighting, it's just more difficult to cut:<br/> <i>mail and plate armours are impossible to cut; fighting in plate armour involves a lot of grappling, breaking joints, and stabbing through the gaps, or specialised weapons like maces, hammers and pollaxes</i><br/></li><li>war hammers and axes are huge: <i>actually they are quite small</i><br/></li><li>etc.<br/></li></ul>\nMaybe one day I'll write a blog post about this stuff.</div></blockquote>\n<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
