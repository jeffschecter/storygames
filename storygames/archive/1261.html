                    In the last year I've caught the game design bug. I've particpated in a round of the Ronnies, Game Chef 2006, and now the Reverse Engineering Challenge. Along the way, I also started work on another non-contest design. I'm sure many of you are in the same situation - many projects, little time.<br/><br/>So I've got my Game Chef design in playtest now and I'm very optimistic about publishing it next year (at least via PDF, hopefully with a print appearance at Gen Con, too). Things are looking good and I'm very excited about it. But as I move forward, I also find myself turning back to my other designs with new thoughts and approaches to take them in awesome directions. I also was too tempted by the Reverse Engineering Challenge to pass it up. Plus, doing a new design seemed like a good palate cleanser before turning back to playtesting and revision. <br/><br/>My quandry: How do you guys (especially those who have published a game) allocate your work between projects? Where is the line between taking a breather so you can come back with a fresh view and the dithering that prevents you from ever finishing a design (I don't think I'm there, but I want to be wary)? What kinds of pitfalls do rookie designers need to look out for in the different phases of taking a project to publication? I've seen a lot of great reports about how folks have seen a design to fruition and publication, but I haven't seen those reports discuss other projects that were pending at the time and how they affected the designer's work.                </div>

<p>I can only handle one project that has to be <em>just so</em> at a time.  I love having little projects that I can work on when I feel like, and if they turn out rinky-dink and silly that's fine.  But if I had two projects that really consumed me at once I'd be in deep shit.</p>
<p>So right now I've got <em>Misery Bubblegum</em>, which consumes my thoughts and haunts my dreams.  And then I occasionally put some work in on the <em>Invasion from Earth Prime</em> supplement for <em>Capes</em>, and the <em>RPG Warmups</em> book.  Those are goofy little side-projects, and they'll turn out however they turn out, whenever they're finished.</p>

                            I've got a queue with big ideas in it that I force myself to deal with one at a time (it currently has two games in it) and many, many little ideas that come and go and percolate between them.  Some of these little ideas get finished.  One of them will probably become a big idea when Grey Ranks is done.  My plan is to always finish big idea projects.                        </div>

                            I'm currently working on a revised text for Panty Explosion and 2 other games. I concentrate on one game for a few days then, as my interest fades, I switch over to another. I do this between my teaching and my freelance work. I actually find the more work I have the more productive I become. The trick is not to get sidetracked. I'm almost done with the PE revision, and once thats  finished I'll have a lot more time to focu on the other two projects. I knmow there'll be a point when one of these to projects is close enough to being finished that I'll have to drop the other one so I can concentrate my attention for awhile. <br/><br/>Generally what I do is work hard on a project for 2 or 3 days then come back to it in a week, hopefully after I've played it a bit and gotten some new ideas.                        </div>

                            I always have one "big project" (presently <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>) and a handful of "little projects" (like Game Chef or other challenges or one-off ideas).  Occasionally a "little project" starts getting uppity and interferes with the "big project" -- at which point it gets upgraded to "big project" and has to wait in line.  Like Jason, I force myself not to actually <em>work</em> on it, but I do <em>think</em> about it time to time.                        </div>

<p>I have a bunch of "big projects" (more like two) which are on hold pending playtesting. (Bummer of bummers, but conditions are improving)</p>
<p>My "little projects" are usually like super transient--they percolate in my brain for at most a week and then I write them as fast as I can. They're there to refresh the mind.</p>
<p>Too, I operate in cycles - some weeks I'm all game design, some weeks it's all food, sometimes it's art or storytelling, unpredictably. Whatever strikes me as the Thing To Do. The rotation keeps my interests fresh and gives them time to rise (like bread) between periods of working.</p>
