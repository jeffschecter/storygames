I usually have to take whatever players I can find, and that has produced some groups with very scattered playstyles. That means a portion of any group I assemble has a few that have never played rpgs beyond 10 by 10 corridors. Throwing them headlong into story games usually results in a lot of stuttering, stunned looks, frustration and more, so instead I look for games to bridge the gap, to give them the crunchy bits they're comfortable with while also providing the thematic setting elements I, and usually one or two other players in the group, love to play with.<br/><br/>If you've been following my posts, you probably already know I use Legend of the Five Rings a lot, but now I'm looking for new games.

The core character sheet and resolution system, with familiar concepts like "Skills" and "Stunts", seem to distract them from the complexity of Aspects until they're at the point where they desperately need a few more pips and Aspects suddenly spring onto the scene like a knight in shining armour.

It's called <b><a href="http://www.hellasrpg.com" rel="nofollow">HELLAS: Worlds of Sun and Stone</a></b>, and I've been harping on it nonstop since last GenCon. It seamlessly combines stats skills combat and gear crunch on the left, with story-modifiers player-narration flags and setting-defining on the right. It's honestly the first game that I've seen that I thought, "You could have really sim-my players and narrative players get around the same table, focus on a few certain things, and still get a lot out of the game". Most games were built with one or the other in mind, and this one has both, wrapped around an action-y adventure game with dumploads of personal drama.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216498/#Comment_216498" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T10:53:20+00:00" title="July  5, 2009 10:53AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually find <a href="http://www.ipressgames.com/wgp.html" rel="nofollow">"With Great Power..."</a> to be an easy transition for most.

In many ways, it's very traditional as fantasy RPGs and very very crunchy--- but it does create mechanics (Bits) to emphasize character driven play, to allow players to establish what they want to be rewarded for (mechanically speaking), social mechanics that work on a partially meta-level (the DOW), and even the ability to create certain types of NPCs (through Circles) and and situations in the environment (through wises).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, it's not guarantee that if you have your group try BW, that they'll all love it-- or get converted to story gaming.  My own experience (with my old group) was that it was very polarizing.  While everyone seemed fine with the crunch (we were coming from Harnmaster as our regular game), some folks just could not get into the idea of having player-definied beliefs driving play and being used to earn rewards-- or of having characters' mind changed by a mechnanic-- etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216502/#Comment_216502" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T11:21:31+00:00" title="July  5, 2009 11:21AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>Why do you "have to take" players?

I have to constantly search for new players who I can get together with for a few months before having to start the whole process over again. L5R is great, but it's a ton of work to run. I'm looking for something just a fraction less crunch. 16 attributes +skills +ads and disads +special abilities is a little much, or perhaps another game might handle them more efficiently than huge lists scattered over many different books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216521/#Comment_216521" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T13:49:55+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  1:49PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try <a href="http://www.berengad.com/main/index.php?page=bh" rel="nofollow">Beast Hunters.</a><br/><br/>The <a href="http://www.berengad.com/public/beasthunters_demo.pdf" rel="nofollow">demo</a> is freely downloadable.   Start there.  Don't sweat the 1.5 SRD or anything like that.  Save that for later.<br/><br/>The Beast Hunters demo is like sitting around with your friends and stunt-directing a crazy all-out pulp fantasy movie with an unlimited budget.  The fluff and situation in the demo are immediately accessible -- anyone who's watched 300 and/or Conan will get Beast Hunters.  <br/><br/>The rules are pretty simple and can be explained in ten or fifteen minutes.  <br/><br/>It's got players and a game master.  The game master is an arbitrary judge just as in other games, but her powers and role are tightly defined by the rules.<br/><br/>The players are considerably empowered to describe the situation and their response to it.  Creative players who have been dissatisfied by flavorless RPG combat may really take to it.  ( in my never-completed RPG.net review, I called it "the cure for roll-to-hit, roll-damage, zzzz.") <br/><br/>Also, the campaign mode of the game is by default one-on-one, so if just one player takes to it, you just need to grab the rules in pdf or book form and blam!  Instant campaign!  And the campaign doesn't have to be about physical violence -- it can be about social or intellectual violence too.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216545/#Comment_216545" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T17:16:37+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  5:16PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think The Shadow of Yesterday is a pretty darn good gateway game for traditional role players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216550/#Comment_216550" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T18:26:22+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  6:26PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard, along with TSOY and SOTC are probably the best mid-range, trad-leaning indie games we've got.
