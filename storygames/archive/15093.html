First-time poster here at SG, so I hope you'll bear with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've come here to not only beg a moment of your time, but also to ask you to donate to Kids Need To Game.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids Need To Game is a program that I started in March of 2010 in order to solicit donations of new and old games and gaming material for my school\u2019s gaming club, making it the very first-of-its-kind in Denmark.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoleplaying gives young people the opportunity to acquire exciting and complex skills. The games as such invite creativity and learning, for example, oral presentation and language development. Gaming is also responsible for stimulating flexibility and negotiation in social contexts, promoting cooperation, and promoting learning history and culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor students of a non-native English speaking background, playing and learning in English also allows them to develop fantastic use of the English language.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a teacher for many years, I have been able to use RPGs and wargames to not only assist me in teaching the English language, but to sharpen math skills, teamwork and abstract thinking. As such, it was a natural progression for me to seek out and to obtain permission to \u201ctake over\u201d a section of the school library as a gamers corner. Our students do not even have to belong to a school club \u2013 they can simply loan out the materials like they would any other book.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read more about the program <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/Kids-Need-To-Game" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have "really cool" things to give. I'm not trying to fund an RPG project where you can have your name as a playtester, get a hard-copy, have access to a super-secret forum, or win a trip to the sporting event of your choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get how hard it is for people to give "something for nothing"... at least in the sense of a physical reward. And while I have come up with some (I think) neat rewards (thanks to some good advice), I know they aren't necessarily the kind you'll want to brag about online.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had all the money in the world to do anything I wanted, I\u2019d get pretty bored pretty quickly. Waking up in the morning to see that someone has contributed $10 to my Kids Need to Game project on Indiegogo means that I am one step closer to my goal. It also means that someone else is invested in what I\u2019m doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what I'm doing is helping kids. Kids Need To Game isn't about me. If it were about me, even I wouldn't fund it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is incredibly rewarding, as crowdfunding makes me personally responsible to my contributors and the kids themselves, and that support is worth its weight in gold.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it boils down to this: I run this program for over 250 kids at 5 different schools. Despite some excellent game donations from some really awesome people, it just isn't enough. Last week, I plead the case to the school board to agree to double the funding of a crowdfunded program, and I was lucky enough that they agreed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the clincher is this - if I can't raise the money, I am going to have to stop the program at 3 of the 5 schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I do raise it - I'll have the funding that I need to buy all of the gaming material in one shot...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo please, if you're reading this - give.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm <i>not</i> going to tell you to give up that extra large coffee at Starbucks. Nor will I suggest that you skimp on your gas money or that extra pack of smokes. That choice is ultimately up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do need your help to get this raised for the kids. So give $10, $15, $20 or more if you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading,                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343184/#Comment_343184" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-18T15:46:16+00:00" title="September 18, 2011  3:46PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was very glad to have contributed to this worthwhile project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daneofwar" title="daneofwar"><img alt="daneofwar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daneofwar">daneofwar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343220/#Comment_343220" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T03:08:57+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  3:08AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks very much, Jason!

I'm glad to have done so.<br><br>It's not really the same thing, but I've had some experience with trying to get new people to join gaming clubs and groups I've been in, and it almost always comes down to getting this message across to the public: Playing games is an acceptable, sometimes even admirable, pastime and spare time interest for everyone. It's so obvious, but in a way incomprehensible, that doing sports, playing music or even just listening to music (going to concerts etc) is a more accepted lifestyle. Not that these things are in ay way bad; it's just that apart from the exercise you get from sports neither of them has anything that's better than playing games. This initiative seemed to lie in line with that sentiment \u2013 games are good for people \u2013 so I wanted to support it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daneofwar" title="daneofwar"><img alt="daneofwar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daneofwar">daneofwar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343227/#Comment_343227" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T05:50:37+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  5:50AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also glad that you did, Jonatan - thanks very much!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343232/#Comment_343232" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T07:38:09+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  7:38AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonatan, I have to disagree with you on the playing/listening to music front: I personally get a LOT out of those two. Writing and/or playing an emotionally appropriate piece of music can completely change my attitude, can cause me to increase focus, memory, hand-eye coordination...the list goes on. However, I cannot refute that games are an incredibly valuable use of one's time, in a social growth sense, in a visual/kinesthetic learning sense, and in a critical thinking sense. That having been said, it's folly to dismiss music, or even sports (many sports have a lot of strategy and tactics involved, far beyond the basic rules, and teamwork is absolutely vital to almost all sports) as lesser. I just want to see gaming treated as being on a level with those two, because empirically it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
