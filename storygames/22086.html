<h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2>So this is a thread that people can link back to when they are confused about diegetics, diegetical, diegesis etc.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a weird word.<br/><br/>But it’s easily explained by saying that it’s opposite to things like in real life, out of character etc.<br/><br/>Let’s say a game group is sitting in mom’s kitchen and they playing a game set in the magical realm of Gondor. The clock on the wall in mom’s kitchen says it’s eight PM. The time in the magical realm of Gondor is just at the crack of dawn, outside the bandit camp. The diegetical time is just at the crack of dawn, not eight PM.
<h2 id="contrasted-to-dice">Contrasted to “Dice”</h2>Related concepts, sometimes conflated (including by me <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23SloppyAcademic2097&amp;Mode=like">#SloppyAcademic2097</a> ) are the Shared Imagined Space (the “SIS”) and the “Cloud”, the latter most prominently used in <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> ’s <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/599" rel="nofollow">dice and cloud series</a> from ten years ago; which contrasted it with “dice”, a word that means not only dice but also character sheets, numbers, pencils, special abilities, hit points, stats etc.
<h2 id="contrasted-to-mimesis">Contrasted to mimesis</h2>In classical theatre, and in literary criticism, diegesis (which, in that context, means “narrated stuff”) is contrasted to mimesis, which, in that context, means “shown stuff” — “mimicking” is based on the same word, it means imitation).<br/><br/>In many other media, including tabletop RPG and movies, this distinction has often fallen away and the distinction isn’t really being made (including by me <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23SloppyAcademic2097&amp;Mode=like">#SloppyAcademic2097</a> ).<br/><br/>The first time I heard the word “diegetical” it was in the context of “diegetical music is movie music that both the audience and the movie characters hear, maybe they have the radio on in the kitchen and dance to it; extradiegetical music is movie music that only the audience hear — subtle romantic notes as the two main leads first see each other”.<br/><br/>Arguably if people are LARPing out game scenes and <em>showing</em> each other what they do, that’s mimesis rather than diegesis. So maybe that’s a distinction that will be brought back in the future but if you’re digging through old threads don’t worry about it, it’s all the same fuzzy fancy way of saying “in-game”.
<h2 id="why-not-just-say-in-game-then">Why not just say “in-game” then?</h2>This is kind of a selfish reason but the first couple of times I was legit confused. I mistakenly though this: We are sitting around a game table in a game room and we are a game group; aren’t all of our activities, including mom’s wall clock, “in-game”? And, similarly, the “dice” stuff (see above) is <em>definitely</em> part of the game activity but is still not necessarily diegetical.<br/><br/>So I needed a specific, dedicated word and the phrase from the sound track industry came to mind. (This was like decades ago.)<br/><br/>I later learned of the terms “cloud” and the “SIS” and sometimes use those words instead. Sorry about that.♥
<h2 id="update-about-the-term-sis">Update about the term “SIS”</h2>In the past, I’ve used the term SIS a lot for the diegesis, like, a <em>lot</em>, and I can’t rellay go back and edit all those posts, but starting now, I’ll stop using it. Here’s where I went wrong.<br/><br/>I’ve learned (in this thread) that people are really hung up on the “Shared” part of the term SIS (Shared Imagined Space). Re-reading old Forge stuff, they’re not wrong. But, I’ll explain myself.<br/><br/>When I heard the word “Shared”, I thought of the Swedish word “gemensam”. Something you have together. Me and my sister can share a book even though I haven’t read all of it. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shared" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary says</a>:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Wiktionary" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><h3 id="adjective">Adjective</h3><dl><dt><strong>shared</strong> <em>(not comparable)</em></dt><dd>Used by multiple entities or for multiple purposes or in multiple ways. quotations</dd></dl><h4 id="synonyms">Synonyms</h4><ul><li><em>(multiple entities)</em>: common, mutual</li></ul></div></blockquote>Now, I’m <em>not</em> trying to do an “well, <em>actually</em>, the dictionary says so-and-so, so that’s what you meant when you said shared”. Uh, no. If that’s not what they meant, it’s not what they meant. But… it’s what <strong>I</strong> meant when using the word shared imagined space up until the last week or so.<br/><br/>In my view of the phrase “SIS”, I thought it meant “OK, we have this imagined space together. It’s shared by us. The red ball in the chest is part of this shared imagined space even though the chest hasn’t been opened so people don’t know that there’s a red ball in there.”<br/><br/>What some of the Forge nerds sometimes meant by “Shared” was specifically things that have been shared in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/share#Verb" rel="nofollow">sense four in this definition</a>, while I thought they meant sense two. Which to me with my background in semiotics, sense two would’ve made a hell of a lot more sense!<br/><br/>But in this sense-four “Shared Imagined Space”, the red ball is not part of the SIS because it hasn’t been told-about (“shared” sense four) even though it’s a relevant part of our common imagination (sense two).<br/><br/>Through these last few weeks of debate, I’ve, confusingly enough, gradually shifted my use of SIS over to the Forge “sense four” usage <strong>in order to contrast it with my own use of “diegesis” and “canon” and “gamestate” and/or whatever we’re calling it today since we apparently can’t call it SIS</strong> because of this “sense-four-only usage”.                </div>

I mean, sorry that we as a group are using a mix of inconsistent lingo; I'm not sorry for sometimes adapting the words "cloud" or "SIS" because when in Rome♥                        </div>

                            Great summary, Sandra!<br/><br/>I agree in full that these terms can be important and useful. "In-game" is used in the way you describe by most/many gamers, but I agree that it's handy to have a term that distinguishes, say, rolling an actual die on the table from the fictional action that's being imagined.<br/><br/>I like Vincent's "dice" and "cloud", but that also has room for being confusing, since one is a synecdoche and the other a metaphor.

An interesting point! I agree. Sometimes they will align ("yes, she's sitting down in front of me" - that's both true in the actual room where we're playing as well as in our imagined scenario) and sometimes they won't ("he's waving his arms [in real life], but that represents a shield of arcane energy [in the fiction]").                        </div>

                            Thanks for the clarification, Sandra.<br/><br/>I have no schooling in Lit Crit and the vocab you've been posting has been somewhat of a mystery to me.  Your clarification, once I can internalize it to the point of consistency, will, I believe, be a big help in my own particular hobby horse.  Especially WRT to how dice fit into the game play process.  FREX - I would now argue that the die much closer to being mimetic than diegetic.  They aren't being used so much as part of an extradiegetical process (FREX - task resolution) but rather a reflection of the fickle hand of fate mimetically (Something is happening, to use that old term, in the SIS.  I know, the wrong term but old habits are hard to break).<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            I've sometimes thought the same thing; they are just as much "in-game" as the diegesis is                        </div>

Wow! So you were the one who bring the 'term' diegesis/diegetic into the RPG fields?<br/><br/>I've always thought that it came from the Knutepunkt people as in<i>The<br/>Meilahti Model</i> (2003) from  Stenros &amp; Hakkarainen:
<blockquote>A role-playing game is what is created in the interaction between players or between player(s) and gamemaster(s) within a specified diegetic framework.<br/>[...]<br/>Diegesis is what is true within the game. Usually this means the game world. The diegetic frame is composed of what is true in the past (history of the frame and the characters), what the present is, and the expectations of the characters regarding the future. The gamemaster creates the diegetic frame and enunciates it in the depth that is necessary and possible.</blockquote>

                            I've been using the word for many years and have no crossover with that genealogy.  To me the term and usage came directly from screenwriting, and its application to RPGs was readily apparent.  It's such a well-worn word in screenwriting circles, it would not be surprising to learn that many people have pushed it beyond that realm independently of each other.                        </div>

<del>All that stuff really helped me once I later studied lit crit! Figured easy degree is easy if you've already nerded out about things. Is also why I went for linguistics since I had taught myself lojban. In hindsight, I don't really recommend going at it that way. It's a bit cart before horse; you don't learn that many new things, and getting "proof" of my knowledge on paper (in the form of a degree) has so far <b>not</b> been worth the money [last time I ran my own numbers at least].</del> ← kinda weirded myself out talking about this kinda stuff. weird how I can share so openly about my own mental health (lack of) but anything work or study related feels super iffy                        </div>

                            The Nordic tradition indeed developed its own theory tradition independent of the Forge around the same time-frame. Much of what made the '00s so enchanting (read: terrible) here in Finland had its origins in rigorous disagreements between what amounts to a bunch of Forgites vs. a bunch of Nordic immersionists. Sort of like the RPGnet reaction to the Forge, except there's two crazy theory cults spreading their gospel at the same time.<br/><br/>Interesting to hear about the origin of  "diegetic" - I knew that it was adopted for rpg use in that scene, but didn't know who might've taken it up originally.<br/><br/>"Diegesis" is pretty much the same thing as "shared imagined space", if one is inclined to translate jargon between traditions. Other synonyms you see used are "the fiction", "in-game reality", "the Watsonian reality", etc.                        </div>

                            Some people in the OSR world are somewhat allergic to “story” or “media” metaphors (because their games are not stories, damnit, as they like to say!), so they use the term “setting” for the same purpose. (As in, “it’s part of the setting”.) <br/><br/>I personally find that much less clear, but it’s something I hear people saying and typing in those circles.<br/><br/>It’s interesting to consider ways in which diegesis and the SIS differ, as terms. For instance, I’ve always taken the diegesis to be something that relates to the fictional stuff we’re imagining, whereas SIS is more specifically something we actually do at the table together.<br/><br/>In that sense, a sourcebook on the history of Elves (or whatever) could be entirely diegetic but not part of our SIS. A fine line, to be sure, though.                        </div>

                            I think it's an interesting distinction, though, and makes sense with what "diegesis" means in other fields. I mean, it's totally true that what's inside a setting book is <i>not</i> part of the SIS in Forgite analysis, but it is part of a more nebulously defined idea of "this fictional thing we're engaged with". It's very important for the Big Model whether something is factually being imagined and communicated by somebody, or if it's just something that potentially exists in the play tools and background of the players.<br/><br/>When I first encountered "diegesis" in this context (I think it was at Ropecon in say 2003, one of the Finnish Nordic-style theorists giving a lecture on it) it was defined, if I remember correctly, the same as SIS: the actual actively created imagination space at the game table. I at least remember thinking that it seemed like a different word for the same concept.<br/><br/>I can't off-hand name any theory jargon framework that would have a word that clearly encompasses both the fiction present between the players and the fiction present in the GM's notes. "Setting" and similar terms of art come closest in bridging the gap. Probably it's just that everybody who starts thinking carefully figures out that they're two different things before they've come up with an encompassing name for both.                        </div>

                            That's true, I can't think of a word anyone's coined for that hybrid/aggregate of content both in play and at-hand.  I can come kinda close with my term "Operant Space," which includes the use of both Player and GM fictions in addition to the mechanics of the ruleset, but talking about my Operant Space is really talking about my current affordances or available actions, not fictional elements <i>per se</i>, or the SIS in general.                        </div>

                            This is all big brain stuff that I've definitely not studied in an official way but this very discussion was had long ago on this thread - <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13560.0" rel="nofollow">On RPGs and Text [LONG]</a>.<br/><br/>One of the takeaways was that what whatever RPGs are doing is not creating Text and that using Lit Crit terms does not map well onto the activity.  One model that was proposed was three layered - Authoring, Fabula and Syuzhet.<br/><br/>For myself, if it matters, the Shared Imagined Space contains only that information that has been proposed and accepted via the Lumpley Principle.  It is composed only of facts.  What we as individual players <i>think</i> about the facts - <br/><br/>Alice - "Carol was murdered!"<br/>Bob - "No, Ted was only actinging in self-defense!"<br/><br/>- is not the contained within the SIS but is part of what makes role-play so much fun.  The ruminating about what happened, responding emotionally as players, etc. is not part of the SIS anymore than the DM reading a book and <i>planning</i> on introducing Elves into the game some time in the future.  Intentionality (I'm going to reveal I'm vampire three games from now) and acting as an audience member responding to the developing fact space are not part of the SIS.<br/><br/>I don't want to say the SIS is all.  Not in the least.  These other layers that wrap around the SIS are the Awesome Sauce!  I just don't have any idea what these might be called.  I tried once and was embarrassed when I had posted with the complete wrong understandings of the words.  I'll leave that to the experts.  However that we're both audience and creators at the same time (or interwoven time) makes this a very different beast.<br/><br/>If it's not <i>shared</i> then its not part of the Shared Imagined Space.<br/><br/>Ducking away as I'm sure I've made of mess of things on this topic again...<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            I've come around to the 180° position I've had before after re-readign some of the Forge stuff Sil linked. From now on I'm gonna avoid the term Shared Imagined Space and never use it again. Diegesis is the word I'm gonna use even though mimesis might be more appropriate; let's postpone the whole diegesis/mimesis split for a while because I'm already confused enough                        </div>

the fact that I coin words like "blorb" and "frobnication" might be an indication that i'm no friend of academese but we've been saying "diegetical" since i was in high school♥                        </div>

Yes.  So does "diegesis," when talking about a game or a movie.  We all know that what we're creating is fiction.  That's how we avoid the problem of wondering about your mom's clock.  The word "diegetic" and the phrase "in the fiction" are functionally equivalent.                        </div>

                            I think dice stuff is anything that modifies the next 'bit' of cloud. So that could mean a principle like 'make something up', a bit of prep, a resolution mechanic. In a way the 'cue' IS the system. <br/><br/>My main concern is that if we blur the current situation with 'diegetic stuff in the prep', it gets confusing talking about positioning (which is the main thing we're interested in).                         </div>

                            I'm not sure I understand the idea of "offscreen diegesis". Sure, that can (loosely) pertain to what you refer to as 'tier 1 truths', but don't the existence of tier 2 and tier 3 totally demolish the idea of anything outside the SIS being 'real' or binding in any sense?<br/><br/>Game procedures and fictional content, including rolling on random tables and narration, are constantly negotiated among all the participants. There's no way around that.                        </div>

                            Right. For instance, if someone accidentally spills coffee on the module, covering the bit about the sword, and when the PCs enter that room, no sword is described, does it mean anything to say that "it was there before"? <br/><br/>This can be seen even more clearly with random encounters. If we get to the end of the game and we suddenly roll "green dragon!" on a table somewhere, was it "around" the whole time? Well, sort of. We'll probably pretend it was, but it's quite different from the way that Bob the Fighter was "existing" the whole time.                        </div>

Technically you are right that "known by Alice, Bob, and Ted" is a predicate that might differentiate sword X from sword Y.<br/><br/>In the "no-myth" worldview that predicate is inherently ontological; since that <b>isn't</b> the case in our model where there's a canon offscreen diegesis / gamestate, that predicate is just one of many predicates that are good to keep track of and might become relevant. The ontology of the sword is decoupled from the observance of the sword. Copenhagen interpretation strikes again♥                        </div>

Things go on the encounter table because they exist. The table isn't an ontology table, it's an… <i>encounter</i> table; you've <i>met</i> them, <i>encountered</i> them.                        </div>

                            Right. No believing in dragons! All good there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What I mean is: *that particular green dragon* was not part of the diegesis/gamestate/SIS/whatever, until that roll was made. There was no guarantee that roll would be made; it happened as a result of following certain procedures at the table.<br/><br/>So, we can have a dungeon with a "vorpal sword" written down in prep, and a set of random tables which could be used for encounters which includes the possibility of a green dragon. Clearly, the "vorpal sword" is "real" in the sense of being part of the "offscreen gamestate", but the dragon is not, right?*<br/><br/>Now, we play the game. The PCs enter the room with the vorpal sword, and the GM starts describing the room... but then someone says, "Hang on! We forgot to roll for a random encounter!" <br/><br/>Oh no! We pause that narration (no sword has been described yet), and we roll. A green dragon comes up! The PCs fight the dragon and many cool things happen. The GM is about to get back to describing the contents of the room, including the vorpal sword, but then the phone rings and someone has to go to work early! We agree to wrap up the campaign there, and then, sadly, by the time out next session comes around, the GM has moved to Florida (why? oh why?). So we continue playing, but with Julian GMing, instead, and we embark on an entirely different adventure, having left those caverns behind.<br/><br/>Now imagine an alternative version, where there is a Reaction Check (this particular group plays old-school!), and the green dragon gets a Very Friendly result. Thinking this over, Bob the Fighter realizes that his father had mentioned something about rescuing a green dragon hatchling 50 years ago! Oh, wow! Surely, this might be *that very dragon*! Otherwise, how do you explain a green dragon suddenly being all friendly? It must be because it recognizes Bob's heritage! (Maybe he smells like his dad, or something.)<br/><br/>Everyone's laughing, and the idea is so clear and so *right* that no one dares ruin the moment: clearly this is what the gloracle has said.<br/><br/>So!<br/><br/>As far as the prep is concerned, the vorpal sword was "there", right? And was there a friendly green dragon wandering around the dungeon? Not in the same sense as the sword, not at all.<br/><br/>But, as far as what happened diegetically/in the fiction/at the table/in the SIS, the friendly-dragon-that-Bob's-dad-rescued-long-ago is far more "real" than the vorpal sword, which, as far as we are concerned, never existed at all. (It would be pretty hard to explain why, if it had existed and was in that room, the PCs would have left without taking it with them, even if we someday found the module's text and tried to retcon the whole thing...)<br/><br/>I think that illustrates the difference between "offscreen gamestate" and "SIS" pretty clearly.<br/><br/>We can now extend that analogy further - what if this GM doesn't have a random encounter table for this region, and has to make up one, as a tier 3 truth? (Oops! Better make a table for the next session, right? But there's still a dragon in our game now.)<br/><br/><i>What if the GM has poor eyesight and the light was dim and she misread the entry entirely, and it actually said "green goblin"?</i><br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/><br/>(*:  As a sidenote, I'm aware - and sometimes use - a different approach, where random encounter tables are "populated" with entities actually assumed to be "in the area"; and as they are killed or driven away, they are removed from those tables. That's a different thing! Cool, but different. I'm thinking more of a scenario where there is a book of random tables which the GM could pull out to generate random encounters, like "Randolpho the Mad's Tome of Random Encounters, volume 3".)                        </div>

OK, I guess I was conflating these two uses. We often put <i>specific</i> dragons on our tables, and the encounter being rolled means that particular dragon just happened to fly overhead or whatever. She exists even if she's never rolled. We <i>also</i> put 3d6 wolves on there so yeah. You're right.                        </div>

                            I... think I'm OK with that. If the bodega's sign says "50 cents!" but the cashier charges 40 cents, instead, I have no problem saying that the real price was 40 cents, and the sign is just obsolete/mistaken/an error/a lie.<br/><br/>In the same way, if my character's Strength score was a 17, but I've been misreading it as an 11 for the duration of our campaign, in a very real sense, my character's Strength was an 11. We could update it now, but we can't erase all the fictional repercussions (damage rolls, to-hit rolls, missed Strength checks, whatever) from the last 10 sessions. (Although, admittedly, there's some ambiguity there, as well.)<br/><br/>Then again, I'm not a semiotics expert, nor a philosopher. I can take a back seat in this conversation if that's what you all come to consensus around. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(The other examples are false analogies, in my opinion - they have all have actual ramifications in the physical world. Obviously I wouldn't say that "littering is legal" just because I didn't get caught.)                        </div>

Hey, my apologies. I had entirely misunderstood what you'd written there (you were using terms like "as in a dream" to refer to one type of gaming, whereas I thought it was the other - I couldn't quite tell that from your post at the time. We're all good!<br/><br/>I really appreciate your generosity in avoiding escalation. Thank you!                        </div>

                            I added the following into the OP of this thread:
<h2 id="update-about-the-term-sis">Update about the term “SIS”</h2>In the past, I’ve used the term SIS a lot for the diegesis, like, a <em>lot</em>, and I can’t rellay go back and edit all those posts, but starting now, I’ll stop using it. Here’s where I went wrong.<br/><br/>I’ve learned (in this thread) that people are really hung up on the “Shared” part of the term SIS (Shared Imagined Space). Re-reading old Forge stuff, they’re not wrong. But, I’ll explain myself.<br/><br/>When I heard the word “Shared”, I thought of the Swedish word “gemensam”. Something you have together. Me and my sister can share a book even though I haven’t read all of it. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shared" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary says</a>:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Wiktionary" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><h3 id="adjective">Adjective</h3><dl><dt><strong>shared</strong> <em>(not comparable)</em></dt><dd>Used by multiple entities or for multiple purposes or in multiple ways. quotations</dd></dl><h4 id="synonyms">Synonyms</h4><ul><li><em>(multiple entities)</em>: common, mutual</li></ul></div></blockquote>Now, I’m <em>not</em> trying to do an “well, <em>actually</em>, the dictionary says so-and-so, so that’s what you meant when you said shared”. Uh, no. If that’s not what they meant, it’s not what they meant. But… it’s what <strong>I</strong> meant when using the word shared imagined space up until the last week or so.<br/><br/>In my view of the phrase “SIS”, I thought it meant “OK, we have this imagined space together. It’s shared by us. The red ball in the chest is part of this shared imagined space even though the chest hasn’t been opened so people don’t know that there’s a red ball in there.”<br/><br/>What some of the Forge nerds sometimes meant by “Shared” was specifically things that have been shared in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/share#Verb" rel="nofollow">sense four in this definition</a>, while I thought they meant sense two. Which to me with my background in semiotics, sense two would’ve made a hell of a lot more sense!<br/><br/>But in this sense-four “Shared Imagined Space”, the red ball is not part of the SIS because it hasn’t been told-about (“shared” sense four) even though it’s a relevant part of our common imagination (sense two).<br/><br/>Through these last few weeks of debate, I’ve, confusingly enough, gradually shifted my use of SIS over to the Forge “sense four” usage <strong>in order to contrast it with my own use of “diegesis” and “canon” and “gamestate” and/or whatever we’re calling it today since we apparently can’t call it SIS</strong> because of this “sense-four-only usage”.                        </div>

Real life analogy intended.</p></div></blockquote>I wholly disagree with this post.<br/><br/>I want a <em>symmetry</em> in how established the contents of that chest is. In the blorb model, both the DM and the player treat that content (the red ball) as if it is established, it’s just that the player hasn’t opened the chest yet and don’t know about the ball. It’s established to them <em>as an unknown</em>.<br/><br/>In the “no myth” model, when using traditional techniques, the player is expected to treat the chest content as if it were something established. The GM though can hold it lightly and decide later what it is. This is also why I specified that this model is problematic only with traditional techniques. In a hippiefied game there’s no problem for the player to treat the chest contents as “something to be established later”. <strong>Even if the player has understood the proverbial two-minute conversation</strong> [i.e. they’re not me because I’m not smart enough to fully internalize the essential ephemerical nature of the world around me in just two minutes, I guess I work similarly to the “Beliefs”/“not what my character would do” player in Deliverator’s example earlier], but even if a hypothetical player <em>has</em> understood that: when using traditional techniques, <strong>they are expected to pretend to treat the [to them unknown] chest contents <em>as if</em> it was established and immutable</strong> even though they know that it’s not.<br/><br/>In the blorb model where elements can be introduced into the diegesis “off-screen” <em>and become immutable</em> the DM is <em>inherently more restricted</em> and therefor their power is <em>inherently more constrained</em> than in the no-myth model where they have more power of what’s canon since it doens’t become canon until it’s spoken out loud.<br/><br/>In a blorb game, both the players and DM are bound to treat the diegesis “with respect” [i.e. through an interface].<br/>Player’s interface: their character’s actions &amp; statements, i.e. “I open the chest”<br/>DM’s interface: the gloracle, i.e. “the chest has a red ball”<br/><br/>When <strong>being a player</strong> in a “no-myth” game, I’m like “wait, why do I need to use this restricted interface just to talk to you and make up a story together with you? You’re not treating the world as canon so why do I have to? Why can’t I say I open the chest and take out the candlestick in there? That’ll flow much better too instead of having to ask you what’s in it.” Hence a desire for hippiefication. Conversely, when being a player in a blorb game I’m like “OK I want to veeeery carefully, with the edge of my sword, my right arm is outstretched, open that chest”. Or whatever. I kinda automatically start treating the world with respect and the dangers in it with respect, and by “respect” I mean I treat it something that is separate from just the words we are saying right now. Which, in a blorb game, <em>it is</em>. I open the chest and ask you what’s in the chest because you <em>know</em> what’s in the chest and I <em>don’t</em>.<br/><br/>But in the no-myth game why the heck should I get invested in asking you what’s in there? Your guess is as good as mine! Why should I wait for you to say “red ball” when I just can say “candlestick”? Who put you in charge?!<br/><br/>Uh.<br/><br/>Traditional techniques is a mismatch for “no myth” / “Baker/Boss-Care principle adhering” games.<br/><br/><small>[Pre-emptive comment to those who want to bring up AW’s principles/moves in this context: you either think they are gloracular enough for AW to be a full blorb game (in which case it <em>has</em> an established canon before it’s been shared; you adopted the threat map as your tier 1 truths and your principles/agenda/moves as your tier 2 / generative truths and that became “canon”), or you <em>don’t</em>, you think it’s a no-myth game, in which case we’re back to who put you in charge to say that there’s a red ball in there when I need candlesticks.<br/><br/>I.e. pick a more representative no-myth traditional game than this weird borderline game.]</small><br/><br/>Or I could’ve just saved 675 words and wrote “Giving up power to the gloracle is the opposite of claiming power”.<br/><br/><br/> </div>

If that’s what the SIS does means, and was intended to mean in the Forge, then I’ve been using it wrong for the past decade which is what I wanted to say.

                            Yeah, I find the concept of the SIS to be extremely useful. <br/><br/>I can see your desire to include things like prep and canonical “facts” in that space, whereas Forge theory sees that as material informing what the players actually say at the table.<br/><br/>I also agree with DeReel, that there is a bit of an illusion at work when you’re looking at it from the GM’s chair. To say that the sheet of secret notes behind the screen is “shared” is a weird thing to say, when only one player has access to it. The second definition, in other words, is a stretch for most people, I think. <br/><br/>If I come to the table with a backstory I wrote up for my character, but no one else ever reads it, it’s hard for me to say that the word “shared” describes that backstory in any way.<br/><br/>But this is all his semantics/language; I think we all understand what’s actually at stake. I’m just clarifying the use of the term.                         </div>

                            TBH this is semantics. We want to operate on a, uh, thing. That our prep becomes part of. Obviously that thing can't be called the SIS, I get that now, but it's still something we care about &amp; want to work on.                        </div>

                            Look at me, taking crowd requests♥♥♥<br/>It's long so I'll make another double-length post.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So, we can have a dungeon with a “vorpal sword” written down in prep, and a set of random tables which could be used for encounters which includes the possibility of a green dragon.<br/><br/>Clearly, the “vorpal sword” is “real” in the sense of being part of the “offscreen gamestate”, but the dragon is not, right?</p></div></blockquote>This is something that we already discussed; if a dragon is on the encounter table, that’s because the <em>is</em> a dragon roaming around there (and often my tables have a specific, named dragon), we just don’t know when and where. But, that’s not reading the question charitably since there <em>are</em> entities, such as 3d6 wolves, that are less, uh, individual.<br/><br/>The <em>amount</em> of wolves can sometimes be specific (and they are crossed out as they leave the area [for example by being killed]), but usually it’s just “there are wolves here” and that is enough.<br/><br/>But even then, there are … ok, you adress this in a side note, let’s get to it right away:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That’s a different thing! Cool, but different. I’m thinking more of a scenario where there is a book of random tables which the GM could pull out to generate random encounters, like “Randolpho the Mad’s Tome of Random Encounters, volume 3”.</p></div></blockquote>I loved the name “Blorbella’s” as you referred to it later.♥<br/><br/><strong>Normally</strong> you’d go: this encounter table is a canon representation of the entities roaming around here; some are Unique Individuals and some are more “there are a bunch of wolves here” or “there are exactly 29 kobolds here”.<br/><br/><strong>Sometimes</strong> you’re like: enh, I’ll just grab a page of out Blorbella’s <em>and make the entire page canon</em>. For example, you’re doing al-Qadim, so why not use the al-Qadim encounter tables? [Or, rather “Zakhara” is the place, “al-Qadim” is the era. Grumble grumble confusingly named 2e settings…] That’s fine, it’s just a good as the normal case, you are saving yourself work, it’s one of the reasons you use something like aQ in the first place.<br/><br/><strong>If</strong> you are resorting to: OK, they are reeeeally far outside of the prep now, I’ll roll up entries out of “Blorbella’s” but only the rolled entries are canon. <strong>This is, to me, only a fallback solution.</strong> You are disclaiming decision making, great, and you’re doing the whole “tier three, that’s fine, now I know that I need to prep here” catching-yourself-patching-the-hole-loop.<br/><br/>Now, that fallback solution is a great solution, yes, and I’ve used it many times. I haven’t had a name for the technique but let’s call it the Blorbella technique. To reiterate: the Blorbella technique means that <em>only the entries that are actually rolled</em> are injected into the canon.<br/><br/>For example, I’ll start a campaign like this: “Not sure if there’s gonna be D&amp;D, they seemed more into board games, I’ll just put a couple of minutes into prep… OK, I have these four modules [usually tiny little lairs or one-pagers] and this little six-entry table of encounters for the wilderness between them, to represent things that are definitely roaming around in there. <strong>If</strong> they ignore the lairs completely and just spend the session doing wilderness stuff and mine up that table, I’ll just use the Blorbella technique.” (and committing to which specific table out of Blorbella’s that is in use.)<br/><br/>This idea of “fallbacks” is so great because it helps us align our two otherwise incompatible goals: prepping very solidly, <em>and</em> prepping very widely.<br/><br/>(Also, normally, I wouldn’t have the a solid sword and a Blorbella dragon in the same room. Would more likely been that the room content was also from Blorbella’s. (She has rooms and treasures and stuff too.) But that’s a nitpick within another nitpick.)<br/><br/>So. With that in mind, and not overestimating how often we use the Blorbella technique, you are right that it’s a non-zero amount.                        </div>

<em>[Story about how a sword was a tier 1 truth and a green dragon was a tier two truth.]</em>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As far as the prep is concerned, the vorpal sword was “there”, right? And was there a friendly green dragon wandering around the dungeon? Not in the same sense as the sword, not at all.</p></div></blockquote>The sword is still there and if they ever go back there (which they probably won’t) it’ll still be there.<br/><br/><strong>During prep, I sometimes have the NPCs roll to see if they go and grab that sword</strong>, unless the module specically says that they do. Either way, that decision has to be wholly gloracular <em>even though the sword is missed</em>. That’s how I roll. <small>(My combat rules for rolling out NPC vs NPC fighting during prep is a much simplified system compared to on screen fighting. I’m still working on a better system, the one I’ve been using (by an OSR guy) isn’t open source and we’ve had kind of a falling out.)</small><br/><br/>(Oh, the GM moved to Florida? New campaign, new canon, your characters that are being moved over are expies!)<br/><br/>The dragon is there just as the tar on the wall in my Quasqueton is there.<br/><br/>Let me try to phrase the following kind of overly formally:
<ul><li>We have rules for when and how to inject entities (such as swords, dragons and tar patches) into the canon.</li><li>Sometimes, those injections happens during play</li><li>In which case the injections need to be <em>very</em> carefully governed by rules</li></ul>(Once such rule being, for example, “I’ve committed to using the Blorbella technique using tables X, Y and Z if and only if the characters spend more than W time outside of V place”.)<br/><br/>I thought the first of those three bullet points was the sticking point for you? Which the second bullet point answers.<br/><br/>That second bullet point is a sticking point for <em>me</em> though, so I’m glad the third bullet point answers it.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Now imagine an alternative version, where there is a Reaction Check (this particular group plays old-school!), and the green dragon gets a Very Friendly result. Thinking this over, Bob the Fighter realizes that his father had mentioned something about rescuing a green dragon hatchling 50 years ago! Oh, wow! Surely, this might be <em>that very dragon</em>! Otherwise, how do you explain a green dragon suddenly being all friendly? It must be because it recognizes Bob’s heritage! (Maybe he smells like his dad, or something.)<br/><br/>Everyone’s laughing, and the idea is so clear and so <em>right</em> that no one dares ruin the moment: clearly this is what the gloracle has said.</p></div></blockquote>Yes, good job, gloracle!
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But, as far as what happened diegetically/in the fiction/at the table/in the SIS, the friendly-dragon-that-Bob’s-dad-rescued-long-ago is far more “real” than the vorpal sword, which, as far as we are concerned, never existed at all. (It would be pretty hard to explain why, if it had existed and was in that room, the PCs would have left without taking it with them, even if we someday found the module’s text and tried to retcon the whole thing…)</p></div></blockquote>It was a mistake and preserving the integrity of the gamestate demands we correct the mistake.<br/><br/>We’ve talked before about how mistake-correction interacts with system…<br/><br/><strong>If</strong> the mistake was discovered,<br/><br/>here are some ways to correct it.
<ul><li>Let’s say they didn’t see it</li><li>Let’s say they forgot to grab it it</li><li>Let’s say they did go get it after all. Alice, it’s a medium-sized item if you want to grab it.</li></ul>As DM, when I make mistakes, I make a judgment call between
<ul><li>This is small &amp; fixable and I’ll just make a fix on my own</li><li>This is small &amp; fixable but I’ll let the players know what my fix is</li><li>This is a pretty big thing but I know how to fix it, I’ll let the players know what my fix is</li><li>I don’t know how to fix this (I might have several ideas) and I’ll ask the players what they want</li></ul>Those middle two bullets being kind of the same. I do use all four of these. Not that I become aware of <em>that</em> many mistakes, but, it happens.<br/><br/>Correcting mistakes is always painful.<br/><br/>Let me use an analogy, this one might be kind of a stretch:<br/><br/>Someone is playing a game wher you roll 2d6 + a stat vs a number. Let’s say it’s Stars Without Number.<br/><br/>They roll the two dice. There’s an interruption and they lose concentration. They later remember that they were using a skill but they (mistakenly) <em>don’t</em> remember that they’ve already rolled the dice. They grab them and roll them again, this time looking at the result and using it.<br/><br/><strong>In some sense</strong> and in some contexts, it’s correct and descriptive to say that “In Stars Without Number, sometimes players roll 2d6 twice, and use the second roll’s result for their skill”.<br/><br/><strong>In another sense</strong> and in some other contexts, that’s not an appropriate description of the game.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think that illustrates the difference between “offscreen gamestate” and “SIS” pretty clearly.</p></div></blockquote>So what we’ve been saying is that there is a subset of the canon offscreen gamestate that is shared.<br/><br/>That predicate, <code>shared-p</code>, isn’t a particularly earth-shattering or fundamental predicate to keep track of for the DM or rules designer. It <em>can</em> be very important (such as “it’s important to tell them that there’s a vorpal sword here”, even though I’m usually pretty sloppy about that so my players have learned to ask pretty carefully about what stuff they can snarf from each room), but for an example of when it’s less important:<br/><br/>Let’s say the players don’t grab the vorbal sword. “Enh, more medium-sized items… we need to carry water. And it might be cursed af. Let’s leave it”. Now the DM might or mightn’t make a note of that.<br/><br/>If she did, and if the vorpal sword is still there when they return, she’ll say “and the vorpal sword that you saw earlier is still here”.<br/><br/>If she didn’t, and if the vorpal sword is still there when they return, she’ll say “and there’s a vorpal sword here”.<br/><br/>Not an earth-shattering difference in our model.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>We can now extend that analogy further - what if this GM doesn’t have a random encounter table for this region, and has to make up one, as a tier 3 truth? (Oops! Better make a table for the next session, right? But there’s still a dragon in our game now.)</p></div></blockquote>Normally it’s better to err on the side of emptiness &amp; boringness when making tier 3 truths. It’s especially iffy to improvise entities that have teeth and can kill you.

Technically you are right that "known by Alice, Bob, and Ted" is a predicate that might differentiate sword X from sword Y.<br/><br/>In the "no-myth" worldview that predicate is inherently ontological; since that <b>isn't</b> the case in our model where there's a canon offscreen diegesis / gamestate, that predicate is just one of many predicates that are good to keep track of and might become relevant. The ontology of the sword is decoupled from the observance of the sword. Copenhagen interpretation strikes again♥</div></blockquote>
My apologies. I just brushed up on my BigModel theory and in BM terms the sword would be part of the setting but not yet part of the situation. (Although of course, if my character knows about the sword but it’s not in the current scene then it is part of the situation).<br/><br/>So the sword has these states:<br/><br/>part of the setting but not part of the situation<br/>part of the setting, part of the situation but not in the scene<br/>part of the setting, part of the situation, part of the scene<br/><br/>Although if no one cares about the sword it might also be part of the setting, part of the scene, but color rather than part of the situation. <br/><br/>I was conflating SiS with situation, and situation with setting.                         </div>

Very elegant summary.  Its helping clear some of the fog for me.  Would you be so kind as to give an example of the second description.  I'm not looking to challenge any of the statements but I'm not sure what is meant by "scene."<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Lemme try: <br/>A scene is a situation playing out in a location. In games that lean into narrative, a scene is generally completed by the resolution of a key procedural intention, a dramatic gambit or a "beat" (ie, an emotionally significant measure of progress or setback), thereby resolving the situation in one way or another.  In some systems (<i>DramaSystem,</i> for example) the gambit or intention is stated ahead of playing it out, making it somewhat easier to tell when the scene has reached its end.<br/><br/>In games that lean away from narrativism, it's probably easier to consider the scene's end to be the point at which the subject(s) of the scene leave the location and go to another.<br/><br/>ETA: It is possible - though not common - for a scene to cross more than one location.  In this case the narrative model is almost certainly being employed (think "training montage" for instance), and thus the scene is not necessarily limited by geographic concerns.                        </div>

                            2cts : a scene is characters at a location, no interpretation needed. A montage and things like that are best described as a sequence. A sequence is a meaningful unit, so it requires interpretation. If this is important in a game, I'd want to label : vignette, montage, monologue, etc. so that there will be fewer ambiguous cases.                         </div>

                            There is <i>absolutely</i> interpretation needed, and in some games people may even argue over whether the scene is complete or not.  Imagine telling a new GM "put a character in a location.  There, you have completed creating a scene."  No sir, you have not.  OTOH IMHO, the word "sequence," however useful it is from a film perspective, is fairly useless to us here.                        </div>

                            No interpretation with my definition of a scene provided characters are finite beings and a location is delimited. Yes, that theoretically  requires an act of judgement but delimiting locations is not a problem in practice (until I define a location as "the continent",  but this trick soon shows its limits).<br/>What people have trouble with is delimiting scenes because they add "goal" or "tension" as a criterion. Which is not what I do because I don't need to and find it troublesome. <br/>Sequence is a good term for "larger than scene" but is not useful. That's why I'd rather provide specific labels for each specific game.                        </div>

                            Right… Chris Lehrich's Forge posts specifically have been discussed a lot here lately. He kinda messed up some semiotics basics (I mean it was 2004, I could barely spell semiotics back then so I'm not holding that against him) which had some pretty bad consequences for how people saw roleplaying games. I've referred to his conclusions as the "closet language theorem", I know that S-G search sucks (because if you put in multiple words it puts every post that has at least <i>one</i> of the words, or parts of other words, like you search for "all your base" and the word "enthralling" comes up b/c enthr<b>all</b>ing) but the word "closet" should hopefully lead to some instances.                        </div>
