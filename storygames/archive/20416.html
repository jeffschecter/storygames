"Scary" is a somewhat misleading way to put it, because experiencing a horror novel, movie or rpg is not about somehow making the work so extremely scary that it breaks through all rational resistance and "makes even brave men shiver" like some old movie poster might term it; rather, the issue is whether the audience experiences the content in a context where they are willing to "be scared" - willing to immerse in imagining the fear.<br/><br/>(The same phenomenon is found in erotica, incidentally - you don't actually make something so sexy it's irresistible, but rather the first thing you do is to create a space within which a person is willing to feel arousal. Once you get that willingness, the rest is pretty easy.)<br/><br/>This perspective is significant to me particularly when we're discussing the horror genre critically, from an outsider perspective. For instance, I have friends who primarily interpret their experience of e.g. horror movies in terms of "not getting scared", telling everybody as their prime observation that this or that movie wasn't scary at all: a person may value the idea that they're brave and cool and untouchable, for instance, and this makes them unwilling to entertain the idea of immersing in the work. Such a person often values a horror story very differently from the way I do, because they're less willing to buy the conceit of the work, whatever it is.<br/><br/>Thus, my answer is that nothing whatsoever can make a horror game scary in the sense of breaking through an adult's unwillingness to be spooked. If <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> hasn't been scary for you, it may be because it wasn't a very good session (I have a long history of failing in execution with that game myself), or because the content was culturally incompatible with you - or it could be because you yourself categorically refuse to play along with the conceit, and thus make it impossible for the game to be scary.<br/><br/>I'm myself a bit of a horror fan - I dislike torture porn, but like just about everything else. I don't generally speak about "scary", a better term for me is "compelling" - the issue is not whether I'm scared (as a stable adult I'm not), but rather whether I find it interesting to "buy into" the story and experience the tension and distress it portrays.<br/><br/>In gaming the two big and successful horror types are moral horror and horror storytelling. Moral horror games are the likes of <i>My Life with Master</i>, the horror is psychological; the game works if it attracts you to buy into your character's situation to the extent that you can share their feelings of revulsion and despair. On the other hand, horror storytelling games like <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> (or, for more clear examples, <i>Dread</i> and <i>Dead of Night</i> and such) operate on the storytelling principle: a storyteller (the GM) prepares some compelling (scary) imagery, and the players experience it through spoken word immersion. The most interesting technical difference between these two is mainly in that moral horror relies more on plot reveals and character despair, while a horror storytelling game is about pacing (to give players time to immerse) and flavourful fantasmagoria.<br/><br/>The most important ingredients for both types of rpgs to actually feel scary in execution are the following contextual issues:<br/><b>*</b> There is a clear lucidity in the group about this being a horror game where you're trying to get in the mood; this knowledge orients the players, those who are capable of it, to be receptive to the scares.<br/><b>*</b> The players are comfortable with each other and the playing space, and don't have external worries (scheduling, whatever) ruining their concentration.<br/><b>*</b> The horror tropes utilized are actually culturally compatible with the players, they "get" the material being presented and are capable of utilizing it to scare themselves. This is a fine balance, as whoever is responsible for the content in whatever manner needs to strike a balance between the familiar (so as to not actually distress anybody) and the foreign (so as to provide actually striking imagery).<br/><br/>Looking at those issues, my experience is that the third one is easily the single most common way to flub a horror rpg - usually people are well aware and basically willing to play a horror game, and they're comfortable doing it together here and now, but it's the GM who flubs it by playing it safe and bringing either some dry thriller stuff, or horror fantasy bullshit. Neither actually produces the horror game experience: the subtle thriller thing is cerebral and often gets muddled in game rules procedures, while the safe Victorian age vampire/werewolf/ghost plot will rarely inspire anybody to actual horror - at best you'll get survival horror if you're lucky and the execution is actually to the point, which it rarely is. (CoC, for example, is a very bad survival horror game by itself, as it features no tools or structures whatsoever to set up survival horror situations; there's not nearly enough despair, and the pacing is usually all wrong, and the situations too easy to escape when the PCs realize that they are in danger.)<br/><br/>Rules-wise there are many things you can do to make a horror game better and easier and so on, but these things do not generally have anything much to do with the core issue of whether the game is <i>scary</i>. The only exception is basically that the horror game can upload fine phantasmagoric imagery in your brain, ready for use (I like <i>JAGS Wonderland</i> in this regard, without ever having read the actual rules of the game), or it can ask the right questions to get you thinking in the right direction (as the obscure Paul Czege classic <i>Acts of Evil</i> does). Aside from that, the rules and procedures and such are there to make it a <i>good</i> game, not to make it a scary one - that's not in the hands of the designer, for the most part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449238/#Comment_449238" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-02T16:36:55+00:00" title="November  2, 2015  4:36PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group spent about a year playing CoC and ToC a few years ago. I had mixed feelings about these: they were never actually scary, though I enjoyed the immersion in the mythos and the period detail. My group tends to approach every genre in the same joking, not-taking-it-seriously mood, and that wipes out any chance at immersion into horror.<br/><br/>(I've actually been meaning to start a thread asking what I could do about this, because it's been turning me off of roleplaying altogether. I'd like to suggest we try to be more serious, but I don't want to sound like I'm criticizing or pushing them in a direction they don't want to go. And I freely admit I've done my share of joking and fourth-wall-breaking, so this is my doing as much as anyone else's.)<br/><br/>Oh, also I second Eero's recommendation of Wonderland -- never played it either, but the scenario is genuinely frightening in a way I haven't felt from reading any other game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Version_Spot" title="Version_Spot"><img alt="Version_Spot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Version_Spot">Version_Spot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449248/#Comment_449248" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-03T02:36:42+00:00" title="November  3, 2015  2:36AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good horror games limit the players abilities. This is done in a couple of ways. First, the PCs aren't superhuman avatars, they're closer to normal humans, making them much more fragile then typical player characters. This, plus sanity loss from cthulhu games, makes the players play differently, a bit more catiously. <br/><br/>The second is the adversarys. The opposition in these games are typically much more powerful than the players to the point where it would be almost suicidal to take them head on and there are limited number of ways to actually stop them. That and the lore behind these threats is usually pretty elaborate and imaginative. I think things like Call of Cthulhu frighten players a bit more because of its bizarre and evocative nature. A vampire will bite you, a Mi-go will pull your brain out and stick it in a metallic cylinder. <br/><br/>The last bit has nothing to do with the characters and everything to do with the players. Its the placebo effect. The players know they're playing a horror game and will act accordingly, sometimes. I know it seems a bit on the nose, but think about it. When a player encounters a dagger wielding skeleton in DnD, they just hit it until it stops moving or call the cleric to turn it. If they encounter a dagger weilding skeleton in CoC, they either book it or scramble to destroy it before they run out of sanity. In a scary game, they're looking for the scary, to feel a bit of fear. Hell, half the time I'm running a horror game, my players come up with the frightening bits and I just run with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449249/#Comment_449249" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-03T05:34:15+00:00" title="November  3, 2015  5:34AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2015 5:36AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the issue is whether the audience experiences the content in a context where they are willing to "be scared" - willing to immerse in imagining the fear.</blockquote>Agreed 100%.  <br/><br/>There are a million good techniques out there for generating scary material, but to generate a scary <i>experience</i>, you need the right sort of atmosphere and buy-in.  <br/><br/>Some games attempt this with advice on GM tone-setting, others with player prompts, others with high concept scenarios (like "you've all done awful things you can't remember, but now you must try"), others with metagame mechanics ("the higher the Tension number goes, the more horror the GM will bring into play")... but my favorite is probably <i>strict limits on how to play</i>.

My players now hate it - they dont want to be scared and I now have an arsenal of scary techniques sitting unused.<br/><br/>First off - the same adventure can be scary in one game and not in another. I actually dont think that its the adventures that make it scary, or even the premise of the game - its whats you all do with it that makes the difference.<br/><br/>Playing at night helps - though you can get a good spooky effect going in the day its harder work. Low lighting and oddly directed lighting can create a real ambience, as can having appropriate but not too intrusive mood music. Ambient music and soundtracks can often work well. I used to use the soundtracks from the alien films when I wanted suspense and jump scares and would cue in particular tracks to fit with the pacing of events in the game. Something like very early Tangerine Dream worked well for general mood. For some odd reason Ultravox's 'Rage In Eden' also worked really well.<br/><br/>Ambience helps - removing distractions like phones, noises from other rooms etc can help people focus, and focus can help build suspense. Having said that the creepiest thing we ever had happen in a game was back in our days playing it when one of the players parents turned up to pick them up and tapped on the window instead of ringing the doorbell...<br/><br/>Most of the rest comes down to pacing and how the GM speaks. Speaking slower with more pauses between words and the occasional repartition of key words grabs attention and builds suspense - so saying 'you hear a noise from the door at the end of the corridor' has minimal spook effect... saying 'you hear...a noise... a noise from..the door. The door ...at the end of the... corridor' makes everyone nervous. Emphasis of key words makes a difference as well.<br/><br/>That ties in with knowing the adventure well enough that you know where all the points of natural suspense, scares and danger are so you can pace narrative aspects to build up or ramp down suspense. Sometimes the best scares come after a few false build ups and a ramp down. The horror - well that often comes from all the bits left unsaid and just implied and all those in between spaces of building up and ramping down, not actually the events themselves.

I really enjoyed Eero's post, in particular. I'll add a lit tidbit:<br/><br/>I read an essay a long time ago, and I don't remember who wrote it, but I thought it had some good insights.<br/><br/>The idea was such:<br/><br/>Scary stuff in media can be separated into three categories: terror, horror, and dread.<br/><br/>Terror is when you're actually scared. You're watching a movie and there's a loud noise and suddenly there's a murderer on screen. This plays to your human instincts. Perhaps a GM could accomplish this by suddenly turning off the lights or banging on the table really loudly, but basically it's generally only possible to accomplish by a strong shock to the senses. Overused in horror films, and not terribly practical in RPGs. (Perhaps there's an unexplored area within this for RPGs, but the author of the essay certainly didn't think much of it.)<br/><br/>Horror is when you encounter something and you are simply shocked by the, well, horribleness of it all. The door opens and the room is filled with blood and there is a person hanging from the ceiling, suspended by their own intestines! Oh, how horrible, you think. You definitely see this in our roleplaying culture. This can be a powerful effect, but, I would argue, overused in RPGs. There's only some much gruesome imagery and terrible plot revelations you can take before you get desensitized, and the game creator or GM has to keep ramping it up all the time in order for it to be effective.<br/><br/>(I remember a particularly powerful instance of horror in Miike's film "Audition". There's a scene which is extremely uncomfortable to watch. I don't know if I could say I *enjoyed* it, however - I don't have any desire to watch the film again, for example - or, if I did, I would probably fast-forward through that part. Eero's "torture porn" probably fits in this category, as well, if I'm reading him correctly.)<br/><br/>Dread, however, is a much more interesting thing to explore, because it doesn't require special effects and it's extremely flexible. Dread is defined in this essay as the feeling you get when you know something is wrong, or about to go wrong, but you don't know how or why. Unlike the first two, your imagination is free to roam and you're able to thereby scare yourself. <br/><br/>Most of the effective techniques we're talking about here operate on dread. (Vincent's Murderous Ghosts is an excellent example: when you have to tell the MC which thing you really hope the ghost doesn't do, you're forced to imagine them - or at least one of them - and create a sense for yourself that something really bad will happen if this course of events unfolds. No one has said anything scary yet, and still you are filled with uncomfortable feelings (dread).<br/><br/>Scary films which do not overdo the blood-and-guts stuff (horror) or the surprising noises-and-imagery stuff (terror) do it by creating the sense in you that something is terribly *wrong* and something is about to go terribly wrong, and then letting your imagination go to work.<br/><br/>Thinking about how your techniques or rules play into these categories can be an interesting way to look at things (although, of course, any such taxonomies are oversimplifications of the real psychological functions at work).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449275/#Comment_449275" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-04T21:27:19+00:00" title="November  4, 2015  9:27PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2015 9:28PM by BeePeeGee.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would suggest three things:<br/>1. <i>Context</i>: You need to get into the mood of being scared - via setting, environment, atmosphere, intention (as Eero put: "willing to immerse in imagining the fear")...<br/>2. <i>Not Knowing</i>: The most terrible tension and the darkest fantasies arise from now knowing what comes next...<br/>3. <i>Powerlessness</i>: Lack of confidence in your options to react to whatever may arise (as mentioned before "limited options")<br/><br/>One thing I'm not clear about: Who needs to be scared - the character or the player?<br/>Is Bleed a necessary ingredient for true horror or could a player truly enjoy a game if only their character experienced the horror?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449278/#Comment_449278" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-05T13:13:17+00:00" title="November  5, 2015  1:13PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">@BeePeeGee</a><br/>Well, that's a good question.

It worked on a basic "One person narrates a bit, then the other narrates a bit, and so on." format and we played it in the newly renovated (and thus completely bare/unfurnished) living room.<br/><br/>It worked so well, we agreed to stop it after an hour or so because it got too scary for us. (The fact that the sun went down while we played and we didn't get up to turn on the lights certainly played a part there.)<br/><br/>Thinking back on this while reading through this thread, I think what made this work for us where a couple of factors:<br/><br/>* Good location (Bare room, only natural lights, no distractions, ...)<br/>* Motivation (While we didn't actually set out to play a spooky game, it quickly became clear that this was where we were headed and we were fine with that.)<br/>* Focus (Because this was freeform, there were no tokens, charsheets etc. to distract.)<br/>* Dread (Pauls description hits the nail on the head, IMO. What we ended up narrating was us waking up in an empty room, with things appearing and disappearing, lone swinging lightbulbs, rusty knives, etc. Nowhere did a monster or anything appear, there wasn't much in the way of plot and I don't think we even got out of the room before we stopped. But we narrated tiny facts of dreamlike wrongness and let each others heads fill out the rest with imagined terror.)<br/><br/>If I wanted to formalize this a bit, I'd probably make explicit some of the things we did implicitly. For example, because we agreed on "You narrate a bit, I narrate a bit", we kept the narration to a sentence or two at a time, with almost no "out of game"/non-narration talk. This kept us highly focused.<br/><br/>We also implicitly worked on a "Yes, but"/"Yes, also" modell, where what somebody said was absolutely true at that moment, but the other person was free to change the fictional reality later on.<br/><br/>Because narration was a fact or two at the time, the pacing was slow, with lots of time spent just describing tiny details of the room, which allowed us to ease into the weirdness, slowly ramping up the dread as the game progressed.<br/><br/>Almost all of those things we did naively and spontaneously could probably be formalized in explicit rules.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Damn, now I want to try this again. m)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449346/#Comment_449346" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-09T02:35:28+00:00" title="November  9, 2015  2:35AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What form did the narration take?

But there's so much you can do with rules that doesn't involve dice. For example, one thing I've found in recent years is that setting rules for how people speak to each other can do wonders for atmosphere. I'd definitely play around with that if I were to make a horror RPG. I think there are loads and loads of things you can do with rules to enhance a horror game. Session structure, structured prepwork, rules for how you talk and more. sometimes rules can enhance the impact of actions in the fiction by giving them weight. I like to think that the rules in Svart av kval, vit av lust do a lot to improve the mood, and they do it unobtrusively since they're communicated through moving markers and hand gestures, meaning you never have to disrupt the narrative to use them.<br/><br/>Here's an example: In SAKVAL, vampires will always win conflicts against ordinary humans. There's nothing a human can do to win against a vampire, except get the help of a vampire hunter or a mob. In a recent game, there was a very intense scene between Dr Brauschweig, the creator of vampires (who were a bit like Frankenstein's monsters in this setting), and the vampire he had created. Dr. Braunschweig had a gun pointed at the vampire, who was very threatening and intimidating. Afterwards, the player who played Dr. Braunschweig told me that his knowledge as a player that the gun was meaningless and that if the vampire wanted to kill him, there was nothing he could do about it, really enhanced the intensity of that scene. The mechanics gave a weight to the vampire and made it clear to everyone involved the big power difference between the two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/onrigato" title="onrigato"><img alt="onrigato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/onrigato">onrigato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449530/#Comment_449530" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-16T19:04:48+00:00" title="November 16, 2015  7:04PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">@Simon_Pettersson</a>: You're absolutely right!
