(This can serve as an example of Crunch's post, above, as well!)<br/><br/>The game was a science fiction GURPS campaign that had been going on for several years, with a pretty intense political situation that the characters had to try to control in order to save some people's lives and forestall conflict. However, from time to time the characters also carried out reconaissance missions, trying to find some of their enemies, new allies, or some kind of resources.<br/><br/>We were flying through some kind of planetary system when we spotted an ice moon. I don't remember why, but for some reason we decided that we should investigate. The GM kind of hinted that there was nothing to see there ("Uh, are you guys sure that you want to go there? Your sensors are just picking up ice"), but it wasn't really clear whether we might find something there or not. (I'm guessing we didn't have anything better to do, as well - this game tended to drift aimlessly now and again, which is another, but related, problem.)<br/><br/>So we flew down to the moon's surface to land. The GM made us roll Piloting checks for, among other things, making a safe landing. Sure enough, the roll was bad. Bad enough that we had to roll on a table for damage to the craft or something like that, and we discovered that we'd damaged the drive on the craft badly enough that it couldn't take off again.<br/><br/>Now, there was no one and nothing around (in the system), the moon was a featureless ball of ice, and our communications systems didn't have the range to contact anyone further away than that (all this had been also established earlier). We didn't have the parts we needed to fix the craft, and we'd run out of oxygen in three or four hours.<br/><br/>We kept playing for another three hours or so (!!!), but couldn't figure out anything we could do. We were stuck on a featureless ball of ice and doomed to die. The GM was a fair arbiter of causality here, making reasonable and realistic decisions and calls about "what would happen". In the real world, how many arctic expeditions took a wrong turn and then were lost, never heard from again?<br/><br/>The problem was that it just wasn't fun... for anyone. The GM seemed to be more frustrated than anyone. I remember the evening ended with a lot of angry faces and a lot of shouting at each other. ("Why the hell did you guys just want to go there?" "What were we supposed to do?" "What am *I* supposed to do? You don't have enough oxygen to survive much longer; there's not enough time to fix the ship from scratch, without the proper parts..." and so on.)<br/><br/>Everyone went home pissed off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425979/#Comment_425979" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-18T22:07:52+00:00" title="December 18, 2013 10:07PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I took part in a playtest for some commercial third-party OGL adventure (D&amp;D 4E) at a convention.

(As a player, do I concern myself with realism?  Physics?  Psychology?  Tolkein-fidelity?  Cleverness?  Action movie kewlness?  Dramatic oomph?  Who knows!)<br/><br/>3) Introducing <b>nonsense</b> into the fiction -- people, places, things and events which simply don't make any sense once the players interact with them.  <br/><br/>4) <b>Not bothering with characterization</b>; roleplaying every NPC as themself.<br/><br/>5) Providing only <b>content that requires railroading</b>, and then not railroading.<br/><br/>6) Handing the players a situation that doesn't demand action and <b>passively waiting</b> for them to make something of it.<br/><br/>7) <b>Failing to say "this is a dead end"</b>; letting players spend infinite amounts of game time on hopeless endeavors.<br/><br/>8) Putting an <b>unacceptable possibility</b> in an encounter they expect to go the other way.  "Surely you'll easily defeat this monster I put in the Hall of No Escape!  Whoa, you didn't; TPK in a game where we agreed on No TPKs."<br/><br/>9) Creating "challenges" where <b>it's not clear what the challenge is</b> or how to even attempt it.<br/><br/>10) Creating "challenges" that <b>test skills the players don't value</b> (such as "ability to read the GM's mind" or "thinking to look up rather than just left/right/down").<br/><br/>11) Erring on difficulty.  Making challenges <b>way too easy</b> or <b>way too hard</b>.<br/><br/>12) <b>Not prepping</b> when the game requires it.<br/><br/>13) <b>Hurrying</b>.  Introducing decision points before anyone has invested in their subjects.  "As the last orc falls and the battle is won, your long estranged dad who you haven't seen in 50 years runs up to you and says honor demands that he duel you!  Declare stakes and roll!"<br/><br/>14) <b>Not being on top of the rules</b>.  Not knowing them, taking too long to find them, etc.  (This actually just applies to whoever is responsible for knowing the game.

That was super annoying. He also was someone to punish people for not being as on top of the background as he was. Like some Information he just assumed as common knowledge because it was mention in one of the books. Which did not work too well with the group being new to the system (Earthdawn). That game provided some mechanical tools too, to enforce his vision of how the characters should behave. Every character in Earthdawn has a path they follow, a philosophy of life that makes them good at what they are doing and as long as they follow that path they have magical powers. But if they stray from that path they fall into some kind of identity crisis. Which that GM enforced if a character acted in a way he did not understand. He was not all that interested in explanations either, unless it came from a favorite player.<br/>So I guess that falls into the category of "Lack of communication", him not asking the players about stuff that seemed strange.<br/>Also the punishing different visions of the gaming world I think falls under the Acting like a cult leader.<br/><br/>I as GM sometimes lack in preparation time and also good and fitting names for NPCs do not come too easy to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425987/#Comment_425987" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T00:31:01+00:00" title="December 19, 2013 12:31AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2013 12:32AM by TotallyGuy.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once played in a game where the GM jealously guarded information to an unacceptable extent.

Like if a character is kind of barely okay at picking locks, the locks will all be whatever difficulty they need to be for a character who is kind of barely okay at lockpicking to succeed, say, half of the time. Ten sessions later, if that same character is now a grandmaster of lockpicking, all of the locks will now be whatever difficulty they need to be for a lockpicking grandmaster to succeed...half of the time.<br/><br/>A nastier variation on this is the Arms Race GM: when your character gets fire resistance, you can be assured that you will never be attacked with fire ever again. When you learn to cast lightning bolt, everything gets electricity resistance. When you have a sniper rifle, you will never see anything at long range. The GM reshapes the universe so that no time is "wasted" on anything that a character might be immune to or prepared for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425989/#Comment_425989" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T01:06:43+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  1:06AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some mistakes I\u2019ve both made as a GM, and seen as a player.\n<ul><li>Playing favorites</li>\n<li>Aimlessness</li>\n<li>Letting the group talk things out IC too long\u2014believing they were having fun (sometimes they were and it was great, sometimes they were feeling just \u201cstuck\u201d)</li>\n<li>Lack of real risk or danger\u2014situations seemed dangerous in the fiction but mechanically the PCs were always safe</li>\n<li>Going past awesome, via gonzo, into \u201ctoo over the top\u201d</li></ul>\nHere are some that I\u2019ve seen as a player but I hope I haven\u2019t done myself as a GM (though who knows).\n<ul><li>Cut scenes (\u201cbox text\u201d, if not necessarily literally read, sometimes just long non-interactable mood narration)</li>\n<li>Overly loud, repeating, or recognizable music</li>\n<li>Huge glowing screen and blasting fans of a giant laptop at the table</li>\n<li>Too scary horror</li></ul>\n(I\u2019ve omitted all the mistakes that would fall into my own definitions of illusionism.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425990/#Comment_425990" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T01:15:13+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  1:15AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Like if a character is kind of barely okay at picking locks, the locks will all be whatever difficulty they need to be for a character who is kind of barely okay at lockpicking to succeed, say, half of the time.

And I have no idea how often I should do this.<br/><br/>I think \u201c50% of success\u201d is too low, I love ye olde \u201c62% chance of success = fun to play\u201d rule (that\u2019s implicitly afforded by Fudge\u2019s mechanics, though not spelled out in the text).<br/><br/>I think it\u2019s appropriate for a grandmaster of lockpicking to face locks that are a challenge even for them. If that never happens, it\u2019s like your lightning character who never gets to get really use their lightning skill.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, one part of dungeon/wilderness crawling that I really love is that how we can go to more challenging areas or more weak areas on our own accord\u2014the universe isn\u2019t \u201cscaled to our level\u201d. A friend of mine, whom I sometimes GM, is really sensitive to such \u201cscaling\u201d and he often complains about the recent Elder Scrolls computer games (which I have never played) in this regard.

But\u2026 I really don\u2019t like it. However, for me this can so easily fall into illusionism (it\u2019s not always used for that, but it\u2019s certainly one of the tools the illusionist can use).\n<blockquote>Introducing <b>nonsense</b> into the fiction -- people, places, things and events which simply don't make any sense once the players interact with them. </blockquote>\nThis one is hard to avoid completely, though, for me at least. It\u2019s happened in our Fiasco games, even. My imagination tends to leap before it looks.\n<blockquote><b>Not bothering with characterization</b>; roleplaying every NPC as themself.</blockquote>\nI\u2019m fine with this, actually. I think it takes the focus away from the NPCs. I\u2019ve seen the opposite (weird faces and NPCs) done super well, of course.\n<blockquote><b>Failing to say "this is a dead end"</b>; letting players spend infinite amounts of game time on hopeless endeavors.</blockquote>\nWould you please clarify what you mean here, David?\n<blockquote><b>Not prepping</b> when the game requires it.</blockquote>\nAs an aside (not absolving us who\u2019s done this), I wish these games said explicitly what the GM must prep before hand.\n<blockquote><b>Not being on top of the rules</b>.  Not knowing them, taking too long to find them, etc.</blockquote>\nPersonally, I don\u2019t really count this as a mistake because learning-by-trying is the best way for many people to learn. Will these sessions have lower quality? Yes. But\u2026 it seems to me like \u201cthe only way out is through\u201d applies here\u2014it\u2019s an unavoidable mistake which can best be mitigated by using games with fewer, easier and more accessible rules.\n<blockquote><b>Acting like a cult leader</b>. [\u2026] some texts and cultures actually encourage it, and well-meaning folks could wind up thinking this is simply how it's done.</blockquote>\nIt also makes sense in that particular context, because those texts and cultures also put a big burden on the GM.

It shouldn't be on every door. It shouldn't even be on most doors. It should maybe be on the most important door, and man, whatever's on the other side of that door should be worth using that lock on.

Disregarding those can be a bad GM habit in any game.  One I've been guilty of in the past too. The reason was that i had played only with good friends for years and the stepping out to play with more and diverse people I made some bad judgements. I alsow wasn't too aware of the concept of triggers and stuff like that back then either. But that is something I changed with experience.<br/>Today if I go for horrific triggering stuff in a scenario I do write a warning beforehand. And I am more conscious about throwing it in anyway. As I am in everyday conversations.<br/><br/>I also agree on there being two schools or approaches to horror games in who is intended to be scared. I personally usually go for the "scaring the characters first" school and use systems that work with that. If I manage to scare the players as well or just creep them out that is a fine extra and usually leads to the best sessions in my experience. But horror GM chat will distract from the main topic I fear.<br/>So what we can get from this for the topic at hand is: Know where you want to focus stuff. A GM trying to scare the players, while they just want their PCs to be scared might be doing it wrong. The same with giving challenges to players or characters. Like solving a puzzle, if you force that on players that aren't interested it won't work.<br/>Choosing the right system goes into that of course, assuming that the choice of system is part of the GM's planning.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426001/#Comment_426001" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T02:38:25+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  2:38AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2013 2:39AM by summerdown.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Another way to look at it is to remember that it's totally fun to be the grandmaster of lockpicking when it means you breeze through the locks that challenged you back when you were just kind of barely okay at picking locks.

She statted up a character who had massive stealth skills and could breeze in and out of places like a ninja. I figured that was a flag on the character sheet indicating what she wanted the game to be about, so I gave her lots of stealth challenges.<br/><br/>It didn't go as well as I expected, but I persevered.<br/><br/>In week three she explained why she was getting frustrated: she'd put all those points into stealth because that was what she <i>didn't</i> want the game to be about. She expected to just succeed in sneaking, and have the challenge appear somewhere else!<br/><br/>Another anecdote: I used to love playing Might and Magic V on the computer, because when I became powerful, I could go back to low level areas and level an entire squad of enemies with a single fireball <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426002/#Comment_426002" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T02:47:42+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  2:47AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2013 2:48AM by Rickard.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Those discussions about railroading and illusionism lead to a lot of "that's not problematic / that's not railroading" and claims that anything you don't like in a GM'd game is railroading and anything you're okay with isn't...</blockquote>\nThe same problem occurs when people are trying to define roleplaying games. The only thing they do is to say what they prefer. The Big Model is one example of this. But to answer the original question.<br/><br/>\xd7 <b>Playing out every day</b> during travel, so you can't spot when there is going to be an ambush. I myself is for hard scene cutting: to only play out scenes where things are happening, even if it's as tiny as setting the mood. One scene can be to describe a city, another a person sighing. But don't play out dead time.<br/><br/>\xd7 <b>Minimizing women.</b> I had game masters where all women in their world were described as beautiful. I have forced myself to include at least 40-60% women in my scenarios and place them in a powerful position or avoiding "typical roles". We even had a gaming company in Sweden where all the women were either whores or Madonnas. It was so depressing to see.<br/><br/>\xd7 <b>The game master vs the players</b>. This is just destructive for a gaming session, even in competitive games. I tend to see the game master, in those kinds of game, as a crossword maker. There should be a difficulty and hard to solve but not impossible or unfair. I had a game master where he took all slayed NPCs in a battle as a loss: bad game mastering.<br/><br/>\xd7 <b>Punishing players.</b> Same game master. He even sent a green dragon upon us because things were to easy for us. Another game master didn't give out XP because I didn't play a character according to his preferences. I hate game master bias, and punishing the players like that makes me become anxious. I personally go with the flow and give out other kinds of rewards to acknowledge the players.<br/><br/>\xd7 <b>Not caring.</b> Had a few of these game masters at conventions, where they mostly showed up to acquire free entry fee.<br/><br/>\xd7 <a href="http://improvencyclopedia.org/glossary//Waffling.html" rel="nofollow">Waffling</a>. Stalling when the game master has nothing to contribute, just make time pass because the game master ran out of material or to improvising a red herring. I made this mistake a couple of times myself back in the days.<br/><br/>\xd7 <b>Chicken out on terminating the session.</b> I still do this. When things don't work, stop the game and have a discussion about the game. I have a tendency to try to move on and hope that everything will sort itself out. This will most of the times instead prolong the pain.<br/><br/>\xd7 <b>Mary Sue.</b> Bring a NPC along that is the teacher's pet.<br/><br/>\xd7 <b>Being illogical.</b> When the reaction of the world shakes the verisimilitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426004/#Comment_426004" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T03:07:10+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  3:07AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is pacing the game too slowly.

Some of them read to me as things that aren't a big deal if they happen once or twice, but too much of it can really ruin a session. Needing to look up one set of monster stats you forgot to print out, or one rule you don't remember, seems fine to me, in general.<br/><br/>The GMing problems identified here seem almost like the Geek Social Fallacies: reasonable ideas taken to an extreme. Like, yes, it's okay to play with your friends, no it's not okay to make the game less fun for the people you know less well (especially deliberately). Yes, it's okay to create cool NPCs, but no, it's not okay to make them invincible and outshine the PCs. etc. (Of course, one could also apply this logic to the usual sort of railroading discussions: yes, you need to have a punchy starting situation [that the PCs don't get a choice in, generally], but no, it's not alright to pre-plan how it's all going to play out.)<br/><br/>I wonder if that might actually be a good way of framing it for people. Otherwise, too much GMing advice, even very good advice, can just come off as sounding very negative and full of "don't"s.<br/><br/>I do like Orlando's idea about getting Dave's list tattooed. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/R00kie" title="R00kie"><img alt="R00kie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/R00kie">R00kie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426006/#Comment_426006" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T04:36:11+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  4:36AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The worst sins I've seen from GMs involve excessive introduction of pointless fact into the fiction:<br/><br/>1) I've played (twice) with an historian with an encyclopaedic knowledge of Victorian English Architecture who couldn't take a hint that enough was enough.

The game system has rules for how long the journey would take and how likely it is for something to happen on the way (locally, a roll for wandering monsters for every turn. On larger scale, a certain number of rolls or certain things per hex). I love this style as a player. Going in and out of character\u2026 And then if/when something happens, it can become very moody.<br/><br/><br/>And you\u2019re right that \u201csetting the mood\u201d can be a valid raison d\u2019\xeatre for a scene.

Many of the posts in this thread are gold! Great thread, guys!<br/><br/>But for some games it\u2019s completely appropriate to have such a vs situation.

It's an easy mistake to make, especially in the aftermath of all that GM advice about treating what's on the character sheet as a flag for what the player wants to see in the game. And yeah, it sort of is: if someone makes a stealthy character and there's never any opportunity to use stealth, then you feel like there should be a refund and maybe an apology. ("Sorry, stealth isn't a thing in this game. Take those points back and spend them on something you'll actually get to use!")<br/><br/>But when a player puts a LOT of points into a particular skill for their character, as you say, it can just as easily mean "I don't want this to be a thing I have to spend a lot of time dealing with" as the more-traditional "I want to be doing this all the time." But either way, it certainly doesn't mean "I want this to be really hard for my character to do most of the time."

Like if a character is kind of barely okay at picking locks, the locks will all be whatever difficulty they need to be for a character who is kind of barely okay at lockpicking to succeed, say, half of the time.

Your numbers change but because the difficulty is scaled, you don't change at all. This is a huge problem I had with D&amp;D4. I also think this is more common than people realize. I know from my old groups that some game masters thought like this. That if the value is too low, a bonus would be given and decreasing the value if it's too high. I remember when I made a "extreme sporter" and had 100% on my extreme sport skill. I just wanted it so I could describe my actions like participating in an action movie. What my game master did was to always give me negative modification because "otherwise it wouldn't be exciting". Not all actions (dice rolls) need to be exciting, and I think that's a major flaw in most game masters heads.\n<blockquote>A nastier variation on this is the Arms Race GM: when your character gets fire resistance, you can be assured that you will never be attacked with fire ever again. When you learn to cast lightning bolt, everything gets electricity resistance. When you have a sniper rifle, you will never see anything at long range. The GM reshapes the universe so that no time is "wasted" on anything that a character might be immune to or prepared for.</blockquote>\nOne of my game master mantras is to always make my players feel smart. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But I guess me mixing in the above elements feels like illusionism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426017/#Comment_426017" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T07:15:28+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  7:15AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2013 7:15AM by Rickard.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The GMing problems identified here seem almost like the Geek Social Fallacies: reasonable ideas taken to an extreme.</blockquote>\nI think this is spot on and summarizes the whole thread.

Very frustrating for new players who just didn't understand how to make the best use of their characters' skillset. My simple solution to that has been to only play systems these days that don't have pages and pages of tactical manoeuvres, each of which have their own specific ruleset (actually, I did start trying things like giving players decks of cards to use, but changing the game has proven a much better solution all round).<br/><br/>My big problem with GMs playing more narrative, collaborative games is not picking up that not everyone is on the same page before rushing things forward or (closely related) letting the most extrovert and outspoken player set the pace. You can often feel like you're spending the entire game doing nothing because before you get a chance to get a word in edgewise, the star player has moved the story on another 3 chapters.<br/><br/>(Partly that's a simple matter of self confidence and getting to know the group better, but GMs should develop strategies to mitigate this).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426019/#Comment_426019" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T07:24:16+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  7:24AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the whole "narrating every day of a journey" thing: in retrospect, I really wish I had used an apocalypse world style "embark on a journey" move when playing trad games in the past. 10-12 everything goes fine, 7-9 uneventful but it's tiring, takes too long, etc, miss there's some kind of encounter.

Or the idea that a GM should tell players that this is a dead end conflicts with a gm not railroading, if the players wander into a dead end dont the players hold some responsibility in getting out of it?  Not that I'm advocating floundering around for a long period but I dont think this is something you can simply pin on the GM as bad GMing.  It's a challenge of engaging in this medium, on one hand is the risk of railroading on the other the risk of floundering to avoid it you have to develop a system of communication and an understanding of what the responsibilies of players and gm's are in this particular game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426022/#Comment_426022" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T08:26:49+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  8:26AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vernon, yes.

It\u2019s also worth noting that this occurred back in the mid to late 1980s and the GM in question later became a fabulous GM.<br/><br/>We were playing Twilight 2000 which at the time was a newish game. We'd put aside an entire Saturday and met up at the GMs house.<br/><br/>We spent about 2 hours making characters and then we hit the opening scene. We were all asleep in a tent. The GM asked us to make some perception rolls and I failed. A gunfight ensued and my character didn't wake up during the first round. He was however shot in his sleep and seriously injured.<br/><br/>After the fight they dragged me off for surgery. I can\u2019t recall the details but after surgery he was still comatose. They party went off on some form of adventure leaving my character comatose in hospital. Hours later they completed that adventure and returned to camp.<br/><br/>Later the camp was attacked. The other characters fled, stuffing my comatose character in the back of a truck. More adventures ensued. My character didn\u2019t wake up. In fact he spent the rest of the day comatose in the truck - until late evening the truck was blown up with my character still inside. The GM asked if I wanted to make a new character and I declined.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426029/#Comment_426029" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T09:29:02+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  9:29AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a wonderful, painful story! I remember stuff like that happening when I started playing these games, too.<br/><br/>Some people were asking about Dave's "dead ends" point, and I think I can explain that.<br/><br/>When you're playing a game, just like in any sport event, any good film, great story, etc, the important part is that there is always something meaningful at stake. We're spending time playing and/or doing something because it creates the possibility to develop something we're interested exploring, something which we enjoy, and which enriches the game.<br/><br/>Let's say the PCs are exploring a dungeon, and they've become convinced that a certain room is hiding a secret door. However, the GM knows that there is no such thing in this particular room.<br/><br/>How do you play this out? In many styles of play, players are rewarded for trying new approaches, looking at every angle, and interrogating the GM. They could potentially spend an hour -- or even longer! -- testing for openings, rolling skill checks, asking the GM to describe the room in more detail, prodding at things, collecting resources and tools for further tests, making detailed plans about they will check for secret passages in this room when they come back tomorrow, and so on.<br/><br/>How do you know if this is a good thing to do in the game? Well, there are a few ways:<br/><br/>1. Perhaps the most obvious: observe the players (including the GM). Look at their body language, how they're talking to each other, their facial expressions. Are they having fun? Is there a sense of enthusiasm? It's usually not too hard to see if someone isn't having a good time so long as you don't forget to check in. And, if you can't tell, you can always just ask, straight up - almost always a good move, especially if playing with strangers.<br/><br/>2. Is the current action creating material for future play, which will enrich the game? In some groups, and some games, there are arguably "boring" activities which take up play time, but are welcome overall. Making maps or detailed contingency plans, designing new moves/rules, creating game art, fleshing out background information... all this stuff can sometimes be welcome even if it derails the action of the game. Body language and/or direct questions are good here.<br/><br/>Another example, though, is some point of relevance which is not immediately apparent. For example, let's say this group of dungeon delvers finds an interesting way to check for secret passages: let's say they want to start a magical fire which creates colourful smoke, and then look for drafts by following the tendrils of smoke. This would be a total waste of time if there were no secret doors to be found... but it might actually be worth doing if the GM realizes that the smoke will attract a certain type of monster, or get the characters in trouble with an important NPC. Imagine that there is a war going on on the surface, and green smoke is used as a signal to attack by the foreign invaders. Suddenly, the smoke the PCs are making in the dungeon, floating up to the surface, becomes an important event!<br/><br/>3. Most importantly, however, I like to ask: is something at stake here?<br/><br/>Is the current action going to have important consequences of some kind?<br/><br/>Taking time to look for something that doesn't exist might be important for a variety of reasons:<br/><br/>* The group values <i>not being able to tell</i> when a certain search is pointless, so they can't figure out where things are just by seeing how long it takes to find them. (I can't imagine many groups wanting to spend an hour looking for something that doesn't exist, but a nod towards sufficiently consistent behaviour from the GM can be a necessary context in some play styles.)<br/><br/>* Taking the time to search for the secret door is an important strategic decision, and the group values the possibility of failure more than the potential for wasted time. Maybe the characters only have so much time remaining (their torches are burning low), and taking this time could mean that they will miss out on another challenge. In this case, though, it's important to separate the concept of "time spent" in the fiction from actual time we, the players, are wasting. Here it's probably best to abstract away the time spent searching and move on to the next thing: the important part is that the *characters* lost some time, not the *players*, so let's keep it that way.<br/><br/>Old-school dungeon crawls deal with this nicely with wandering monster checks and similar mechanics which make taking time to do something a potentially life-threatening decision. We can decide how long we spend searching, roll those checks, and move on to the next part of the game.<br/><br/>* There is another reason why this scene is important, orthogonal to the issue of the secret door. For example, there is an important conflict taking place between two of the PCs, and playing through the search for the secret door will allow us to resolve or escalate that conflict. Or the characters are having a really important discussion which has everyone paying attention at the same time.<br/><br/>Generally, though, I think it's best if any group develops some simple method to cut out wasted time. Outside of the three categories I listed above, I can't think of any good reasons why the game wouldn't be improved by the GM saying, "There's nothing to find here. What do you want to do next?" Or even, "Ok, you spend X amount of time searching, you do your very best, you expend [whatever resources], but you don't find anything. You can tell that further searching isn't getting you anywhere, either. What do you want to do next?"<br/><br/>This is what Dave was talking about with regards to a GM failing to identify a dead end. Think of it this way: a whole group of people is engaged in a totally pointless enterprise. Only one person in the group knows for sure that the activity is pointless. The onus is on that one person to speak up and let people know they're wasting their time.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426030/#Comment_426030" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T09:36:57+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  9:36AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me of a game I was once invited to join. The game was a long-term Star Wars campaign in progress. I was visiting the city (a pretty rare occasion, I would visit for a handful of days once a year, or less often), so my friends invited me to me a "guest star" in the game. They were a fun bunch, and the game was really cool - I was excited to play, as well as excited to see some friends I didn't get to see more than once a year.<br/><br/>I made a character for the game and was ready to go. However, the PCs were engaged with some kind of mercantile business on the side, and the off-screen business venture was important - they needed the money for something-or-other, and the players were invested in seeing it pan out. <br/><br/>They had just bought several ships, which were going to be used to carry the goods from system to system. So they had to spend the session statting up the ships first: a lengthy procedure, given the way ship stats worked in this game, plus they wanted to name important crew members, figure out prices for the goods carried, look at where the ships might travel, how much fuel they needed to carry to get there, etc. <br/><br/>I spent the whole session watching them roll on tables and look up distances between star systems in one of their books. We never ended up actually playing through anything.<br/><br/>The GM did apologize to me, but made it pretty clear that this was just "bad luck" on my part - after all, this was important and there was nothing he could do about it!<br/><br/>In this case, I don't think the GM was the only one responsible - this was a bit of social mishap the entire group was involved in. It wasn't much fun for me, though, and a total waste of a pretty precious evening (I was only visiting for three days, and would have used that time to see some people I cared about, or to do something fun).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426032/#Comment_426032" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T10:50:40+00:00" title="December 19, 2013 10:50AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember some Forge thread about some guy playing Vampire: The Masquerade and having the ST make him roll a check to operate a copy machine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426034/#Comment_426034" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T10:55:52+00:00" title="December 19, 2013 10:55AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2013 10:56AM by catty_big.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I remember some Forge thread about some guy playing Vampire: The Masquerade and having the ST make him roll a check to operate a copy machine.</blockquote>Ah yes, of course, the 'making players roll for absolutely everything' style of GMing.

      Paul, I was the one who asked about the dead ends.<br/><br/>When we play D&amp;D, we often do such searching and logistics OOC and snappily. It is part of the game. If there are no dead ends then there is now longer a Barrow<i>maze</i>, it's simply a \u201cBarrow\u201d. The DM has a good pokerface and says \u201cOK, you spend X resources and Y hours pass. Still nothing\u201d similar to your proposed solution, but doesn\u2019t say \u201cAnd there\u2019s not going to be anything here\u201d. It\u2019s a huge place of mystery!  (And of course wandering monsters tend to come\u2014we\u2019ve set up a system of lookouts and early watches, and we\u2019ve hired henches to help us dig and break down walls.)<br/><br/>So yes, we don\u2019t spend hours around the table to play out what takes hours inside the dungeon.<br/>Perhaps this is why I didn\u2019t understand exactly what David was going for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426037/#Comment_426037" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T11:32:58+00:00" title="December 19, 2013 11:32AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2013 11:34AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>"looks like you rolled an 8, which should beat the standard difficulty of 7, but oh by the way, this guy's standing on a toppled pillar, and high ground gives +2, meaning you needed a 9."</blockquote>This is one that I see all the time and I even see it suggested to new GMs from veterans, for various reasons such as \u201ckeep the mood\u201d, or \u201ctake out the boring numbers from the game\u201d or \u201cthe GM is god\u201d or anything else. But\u2026 I really don\u2019t like it. However, for me this can so easily fall into illusionism (it\u2019s not always used for that, but it\u2019s certainly one of the tools the illusionist can use).</blockquote>If the GM wants to give all their NPCs high ground, that's fine with me, just <i>tell me -- before</i> I've swung my sword at them!  Because, y'know, I might <i>not</i> do the same thing to a guy on a pillar as to a guy who's not on a pillar.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Introducing <b>nonsense</b> into the fiction -- people, places, things and events which simply don't make any sense once the players interact with them. </blockquote>This one is hard to avoid completely, though, for me at least. It\u2019s happened in our Fiasco games, even. My imagination tends to leap before it looks.</blockquote>Me too!  But there are clearly ways to avoid this.  I don't beat myself up when I do this, but I do consider it to be not my best GMing.\n<blockquote><blockquote><b>Not bothering with characterization</b>; roleplaying every NPC as themself.</blockquote>I\u2019m fine with this, actually. I think it takes the focus away from the NPCs. I\u2019ve seen the opposite (weird faces and NPCs) done super well, of course.</blockquote>Simply <i>not</i> roleplaying an NPC -- summarizing an interaction, or letting the NPC deliver a prompt and then shut up -- might be the perfect way to go for a given scene.  But when the GM <i>does</i> roleplay an NPC, half-assing it is never ideal in my book.\n<blockquote><blockquote><b>Not being on top of the rules</b>.  Not knowing them, taking too long to find them, etc.</blockquote>Personally, I don\u2019t really count this as a mistake because learning-by-trying is the best way for many people to learn. Will these sessions have lower quality? Yes. But\u2026 it seems to me like \u201cthe only way out is through\u201d applies here\u2014it\u2019s an unavoidable mistake which can best be mitigated by using games with fewer, easier and more accessible rules.</blockquote>If the whole group wants to play a game whose rules require searching... and no one person is supposed to be responsible for making that easier by memorizing rules or page numbers or making a cheat sheet... then no one is at fault.  But if the GM says, "Come play this game that I'm the expert on, you needn't concern yourself with rules mastery," and then I show up and the game is constantly put on hold while the GM flips back and forth and back and forth... well, I'm not gonna want to play that way anymore.  This bugs me <i>way</i> more than aimless roleplay, where at least I'm free to make it interesting for <i>me</i> by doing character development stuff even if the adventuring party isn't accomplishing anything.

Talking to the group about it and then telling the GM about it seen to do the trick. A few more mistakes I've seen a GM do:<br/><br/>-Let the game/group, stress him so much he started to make concessions he got to regret later.<br/>-Introduce items, npc, and powers because they are cool, without thinking if they could break the game in the hands of the players.<br/>-Allow players to use manuals withouth seriously cheking them first. Specially when you can have a really fun and interesting game with the core one already.<br/>-Insist on his interpretation of the rules -for about an hour- while the group as a whole saw it differently. (Even if you're right, there's no chance to bring back the fun to the table after pissing everybody so much. You'll have to work harder to protect the fiction without making it look lika a grudge, because players will try to get revenge on it and tease you until you make something unfair again that proves you were wrong from the beggining.)<br/>-Use rules as written in a way that breakes inmersion and/or work against players clever (but not rules-supported) idea. Yes, exactly when rule zero should be seeing use.<br/>-Applying rule zero in any other moment.<br/><br/>There's a way of turning each kind of GMing mistake into an opportunity, but you need to be in a good frame of mind to do so, a state often related with being ready to:<br/>-roll with the players input, build on it and make the consequences fun/interesting<br/>-Step to the side and watch the situation on a different light. Go outside the box.<br/>-Look at your whole campaign through crosshairs: be ready to change your scheme for developing it, get rid of the boring NPCs or even take the adventure to a whole new place (as it amy happen anyway if players decide your world is so boring they'll take any chance to jump into a different plane of existence)<br/>-Never go back to replay a scene that could go different (in favor of your NPCs) because of a mistake you made. Point the mistake to the players and keep the story going.<br/>-TPK for tragically bad rolls? Make it matter and have it make an impact in the world. New characters should be able to build over the legacy of the deceased ones, or at least find their remains on their first mission and recover their equipment. NPCs should show how the death of the previous party impacted their lives.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426055/#Comment_426055" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T15:17:01+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  3:17PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Later the camp was attacked.

Three sessions of doing absolutely nothing. It sucked for everyone.<br/><br/>(I can't pin that one entirely on the GM, honestly: <i>no one</i> was happy with it, not even the GM, but it was a situation we all created together, because we all agreed on some fundamentally stupid things that ruined our fun.

For a time in college, this kind of outcome was a very real possibility. The mechanics of a game with a deadly combat system that takes awhile to resolve lead to this type of thing.<br/><br/>I have generally been more open to new PCs dropping in once the fight is over.<br/><br/>The game that had the most of this, a friend of mine eventually became interested in playing BECAUSE I didn't pull punches and had a high kill rate. But by the time that player joined, my style had shifted and I was fudging at least a little (and the players had gained system knowledge and the PCs gained levels so combats were less deadly) and he left disappointed.<br/><br/>The most successful PC in that campaign was also one who's character awoke in the middle of a night time fight, realized it was hopeless, and used his low level not really great illusion spell to help him hide in a bush until the fight was over.<br/><br/>So on the one hand, the steadfast adherence to a grim outcome sucked for some players. On the other hand, it gave this one player an extremely meaningful early experience.<br/><br/>I think what this highlights is that sometimes there is a mismatch of expectations. That player probably came out of the campaign with the most system mastery. Another player chose to have his PC charge into a horde of giant ants that he had no hope of surviving. In another game, that second player would be rewarded rather than slapped with the grim reality of his action.<br/><br/>Of some of the other bad GMing, I definitely pushed a lot of GMPCs (my name for the "favored" NPC) on the players. Lately I have been running games and really working hard to avoid this (while being not sure how really to handle NPCs that have been dragged along by the PCs in my Burning Wheel campaigns). In a D&amp;D type game, I would only allow combatant NPCs as hirelings/henchmen that would then be played by the player (and I would only override their decisions if they really were out of place) to avoid the GM playing with himself as he resolves a combat where the only party members standing are NPCs.<br/><br/>I think it's telling that expectations play into a lot of these things when I read some things and say "well, that's not so bad" or "wow, I would never do use Rule 0 these days."<br/><br/>Frank<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426058/#Comment_426058" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T16:08:40+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  4:08PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is straying away from bad GMing and into bad systems territory.

More generally, I take your point and in my earlier example I was definitely guilty of that.<br/><br/>That said, I've very deliberately moved away from trad systems because of all that rules looking up. All that detail is meant to be a help but I find it a hindrance. Even if I don't have rules-lawyery players, there's a little voice in my head that insists that I need to do it by the rule book and not just fudge it (those voices in my head are a pain; there's another that insists I can't play a game without reading all the setting supplements either and stick to the meta narrative. The voices in my head are total dicks). I think making games as complex and detailed as possible and then blaming the players for getting it wrong is a bit of a cop out and leads to roleplaying being more of a niche hobby than it deserves to be.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426080/#Comment_426080" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T07:23:49+00:00" title="December 20, 2013  7:23AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            semajmaharg is right, there's way too many trad games with too many rules, and often those have the rules in several different hardly noticeable places of the book. For example, in PF, one you have read the character creation chapter and made your own, if you're lucky and care to look at the skills chapter, you will notice that somewhere there at the beggining of that chapter there's a mention that you have a +2 to all class skills. There are similar things along all the book and if you've played d20 you can be sure that even a +1 in an unusual situation may be the difference between keep having fun with the character you've invested so much time into, and rolling dice to create a new one.<br/><br/>But the thread is about bad GMing, and playing a game without system mastery is as responsible as driving an imaginary car full of real people without  a license. Easiest solution may be to hack the game in a way that gives you system mastery, which is the equivalent of turning that car into something you're already licensed to drive and used to.

But I'd like to talk about an interesting situation I once found myself in--a game that was often entertaining, even gripping, but also remained frustrating and a curious maelstrom of bad GMing techniques.<br/><br/>Before I start, the GM I'll call F wasn't, in many ways, a bad GM. He created atmospheric, multi-sensory descriptions, had an enormous amount of care and history sunk into the setting, and was frankly a genius at finding emotionally grey situations. These were all qualities I appreciated at the time, and frankly I find sometimes lacking in my own games.<br/><br/>Some background. I started RPing in grade school, back in the early '80s, but after a 2nd Ed D&amp;D campaign I ran my senior year in college, I hadn't been gaming essentially at all for about...sheesh, 14 years. I went to the local D&amp;D meetup one time, and decided to look for a game--and I found a campaign that was forming via their forums. <br/><br/>F, the GM, had heavily--I might say, <i>drastically</i>--overhauled the 3.5 ed rules, changing things from initiative (based on weapon speed &amp; using a d10) to hit location (including a chance to sever limbs). None of the races were standard, and human ethnicities even had their own stat mods. There was a plethora of custom classes, and the progression of the existing classes was radically altered. Crucially, he adopted a spell point system that included the ability to emulate spells not known by the caster.<br/><br/>I didn't have a lot of system mastery at the time, so none of that raised a red flag.<br/><br/>On the forums, F asked where we'd like to start in his world--Celtic setting, or Viking setting. There was a weak preference for Celtic, and so at the first session we began in the capital of CelticKingdom.<br/><br/>And then were promptly whisked halfway across the world to a magically-devastated desert. Those of us who were more into actor stance avowed that they didn't have all their equipment.<br/><br/>The environment was completely different from the Celtic world, and incredibly hostile--I quipped that the ecology was entirely composed of predators. There were some nice touches and reversals, though--the local orc tribe was being oppressed by the evil humans. There was a winged elf who basically wore Big Bad on her sleeve. There was a lot of stuff I liked, and we were RPing well.<br/><br/>Bad things happened. My character got raped, but I decided to let it go to see the complications. One of which turned out to be that she was the victim of a dominate spell, and had her wisdom blasted. (That wasn't the effect of the rape, but the effect of the circumstances that allowed it to happen.) We spent an incredibly frustrating session at the end of the arc--we had found the place we needed to be to stop the Big Badness, but nothing we tried revealed any information, no matter what we did or how many checks we made. Finally my PCs rapist--himself under domination--showed up and sacrificed himself, and we concluded the arc.<br/><br/>(I've talked about the rape here a lot, but it wasn't as big a deal to me at the time as I think it ultimately became.)<br/><br/>After a lot of misdirection, we eventually returned to the Celtic region. And here the problems began in earnest. We lacked a clear rationale to operate as a group--something F frequently berated us for, in the name of party unity. In a different game, that could have been a rich source of interesting situations, as friends and rivals scarred by an intense experience operated with and against each other. But not this game, which was more or less rigged out to be standard D&amp;D high fantasy, and deviation from that idea--or the idea that the PCs could meaningfully effect the world--wasn't on F's agenda.<br/><br/>I'll note in passing that F seemed to want to run a game with a AD&amp;D sensibility under 3rd ed rules. This is generally not a good mix, and wrecked what little system balance exists in 3rd ed.<br/><br/>The flaws that were covered up by the initial survival portion of the game began to become more and more apparent. As my system mastery increased, I became dissatisfied by all the houseruling. d20 games often become all about the PC build--the huge carrot of competence hung out at the end of a long stick. But I couldn't plan my build at all; I didn't know what feats were legal, what houseruled feats were out there, and even the effects of spells.<br/><br/>I also noticed that the changes to the magic rules meant that non-caster characters were worse than useless; all problems could be solved by the two casters in the party--most of them could be solved by the party druid on his own, the only PC consistently able to do anything, mostly by virtue of being able to do <i>everything</i>.<br/><br/>The posts we wrote on the forums became more interesting than the game sessions, because they allowed us to fulfill a creative agenda that actually changed the world. In the sessions, we mostly ended up with very powerful NPCs telling to do things (that they could have easily solved themselves), and a deep metaplot mystery that we had no luck at coming to grips with. <br/><br/>One time on the forums I wrote several posts where I played a game of asking every possible followup question over and over to any leads F gave us. These depressed me--they were as fun to write as a term paper, and seemed to indicate the kind of effort we were supposed to make during sessions.<br/><br/>Once we defeated a circle of evil druids. The druid PC was happy, and immediately began sending settlers to the now cleared region. Until we checked in on them, and discovered the evil had returned. Our victory was meaningless.<br/><br/>And despite this, F created evocative details, beautiful magical effects, and interesting emotional binds. Well, mostly interesting; sometimes he did stuff that in a different kind of game would call for the veil or the X card, or at least "that's not what I want to explore with this character."<br/><br/>In the end, the game foundered. We continued to bitch at each other, mostly because interpersonal relationships were the one thing under our control. Various houserules continued to rankle (the worst was that new PCs could start at the average party level -1, but then had to <i>earn back all that XP before they could advance.</i>) I finally broke off about two sessions before the campaign ended, frustrated with my utter inability to make all the emotional turmoil and growth I had found in my PC have any meaning in session.<br/><br/>I heard once that there are two ways to design a setting--either make it very detailed but somewhat static, like a museum; or give up on the detail and focus on making it a playground for the PCs, like an amusement park. F had found a third way: the campaign was like church. We weren't allowed to touch anything, sometimes gave ritual responses devoid of immediate meaning, and often got berated for our flaws. And the central mysteries were beyond our grasp.<br/><br/>I think about this campaign a lot still, though. It changed the way I ran games--I immediately became a "player's GM" and swore I'd allow PCs to alter the setting based on their own actions. I still remember how rapt we could be sometimes, though, and how much the emotional conflict that the game had brought out some of my best RPing.<br/><br/>But the game transcended railroading and illusionism. Not only didn't our choices matter; there weren't even any to make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426102/#Comment_426102" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T12:01:16+00:00" title="December 20, 2013 12:01PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting things too complex, especially for an action game.

(I've never experienced anything on quite that level of crazy, but I've definitely played in campaigns that were in some ways similarly "amazing" in terms of description and world detail but also turned out to really suck in terms of actual play.) What I mean is, once you've looked back at a campaign like that, and realized how dysfunctional it was, you develop a sort of allergy to that sort of play. Any future brush with it just feels hollow, since you can now see what's really going on.<br/><br/>YMMV, of course.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426108/#Comment_426108" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T13:18:05+00:00" title="December 20, 2013  1:18PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2013 1:20PM by catty_big.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I was thinking specifically of the amount of time it takes to generate characters mid game.</blockquote>\nYeah, I know what you\u2019re saying.\n<blockquote>I've very deliberately moved away from trad systems because of all that rules looking up.

Instead we did a street-level campaign where we were in constant danger, even from normal solitary humans. This is a fun game, but it is not super-heroic...<br/>2) The waiting game, GM waits for the players to make something happen.<br/>3) No premise explained before character creation. So we all show up with characters we love and get to see which ones will work for the campaign at hand or with each other even...<br/>4) Playing favorites, of course.<br/>5) Mysteries. InSpectres is the only game I have seen that handles Mysteries in an acceptable fashion for me. I am horrible at relating clues to the in-game fiction and I am horrible at solving riddles. It is not about wanting to win or anything like that. It is just no fun for me. Even basic riddles are completely unsolvable by me and I don't have anything to add to the game until someone else solves it. I've tried asking questions about the riddle at hand, and it just distracts the people that can solve it and sometimes even sends them down the wrong path to solve it.<br/>6) Using the rules to get what you want, for instance I was told stunting in Exalted would be awesome. The first time I tried to do it, it resulted in me having to make an acrobatics skill roll in order to get my bonus die. If you don't want me running up the wall to strike my foes, just say so, don't hide behind the rules. This goes for roll til you fail and other horribleness.<br/>7) Hidden story elements, the less I know about the story, the less sense all these random events make to me. There is a fun in discovering hidden motivations and secret grudges, but this can be taken too far, too easily. nd there can be fun in knowing why BBEG X wants to kill a school bus full of nuns, you know?<br/>8) Lethal systems plus obnoxious/aggressive NPCs.

My relationship with that campaign is pretty complex--I know that some of my emotions are tied up in it having been my first gaming experience in a decade.<br/><br/>For ease of reference, here's some of the bad GMing things that happened:<br/><br/>1. Altering the Premise Without Warning <br/><br/>The teleportation around the world literally happened in the first five minutes of the campaign--so goodbye, expectations of a Celtic-themed game.<br/><br/>2. Requiring System Mastery...<br/><br/>Builds in d20 are always finicky, but you really needed to carefully plot out your PC for this game or be rendered useless, as one player (CP, from the Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep campaign) frequently was<br/><br/>3. ...But Making It Unacheivable<br/><br/>Of course, the game was so house-ruled (and the rules changed so often) that system mastery was essentially impossible. The druid PC was allowed to do some ridiculous things in his build that made the most competent PC in the group overpowered even for d20.<br/><br/>4. Not Understanding the Game System's Premises<br/><br/>3rd ed DnD is radically different than previous versions of DnD--it has built in assumptions about the amount of combat, treasure, and magic items the PCs will accumulate over time. (Indeed, the game actually breaks down if PCs don't have the expected amount of magic items.) F never allowed us to buy magic items. This, plus his changes to the magic rules, made the well-known disparity of power between casters and martial characters in DnD 3+ even worse.<br/><br/>F's sensibilities worked fine for previous versions of DnD, but not this edition. A couple of times I recommended he change systems to something that would be easier to introduce his vision and actually frame the kind of emotional complications he liked (Fate or Cortex Plus would probably kick ass here) but he liked DnD. So there we were.<br/><br/>5. Pixel-Bitching, Telepathy, Falling In Love With Your Mysteries<br/><br/>In the later parts of the game, if the casters cooperated we could routinely make checks of 35+; with a good roll, we could get that into the 40s. For reference, DnD 3+ considers a TN of 50 as the the start of "epic level". Yet despite that we never got useful information. Part of this was a certain old-school sensibility on F's part, but a lot was needing to read his mind to ask the right question, and him choosing to withhold information to preserve his mysteries.<br/><br/>I admit freely that wanting to achieve "narrative surprise" is one of my own failings, and something I'm trying to get rid of in favor of "character surprise"--surprising events that emerge from the PCs actions. My Post-Modern Masks... campaign still has rather a lot of them; I am indulging them as one last binge before heading to the RPG gym :-) <br/><br/>(I tend to over-rely on the "someone is not the person you thought they were" trope.)<br/><br/>So it goes. I recruited two players from that game for a Pathfinder campaign I ran for over a year (one is still in PMON). I made some fairly fundamental decisions about how I wanted to run a campaign that led me to Ben Robbins' site (because I was looking for ways to prep sessions), and that led me to GMless (&amp; -full) games and ultimately here.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426170/#Comment_426170" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-21T19:09:33+00:00" title="December 21, 2013  7:09PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I heard once that there are two ways to design a setting--either make it very detailed but somewhat static, like a museum; or give up on the detail and focus on making it a playground for the PCs, like an amusement park.

I cleave toward the sandbox model myself, but I might put a tag on future sign-up sheets saying something like 'Feel free to break the exhibits', or a Roger Daltry-inspired: Here's an electric guitar, here's an amplifier- out there is a screaming crowd- you are pumped- <i>Go for it</i>!<br/><br/>Trouble is... there are definitely players out there who will enter the sandbox reluctantly, and will play in it but won't disturb the sand too much, basically waiting for the GM to pick out a path through it for them. Those same players, in the latter example, might shuffle onstage, pick up their instruments and obediently strum their way through Won't Get Fooled Again, but will do so in a conscientious and disiplined way, and will definitely not take me up on my implied invitation to ram their guitars into the expectant amp. <br/><br/>Not only that, but those players will come onto a thread like this and say 'The GM who gives no clues whatsover as to how to play the game, and bascially doesn't get involved, just sitting there expecting the players to do all the work.' Granted, players like that would probably never have even heard about this site, let alone be users on it, but you get the idea. Trust me, those kinds of players exist, and in terrifyingly large numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426178/#Comment_426178" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-22T07:51:10+00:00" title="December 22, 2013  7:51AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What are some good solutions to the problem catty_big describes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426180/#Comment_426180" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-22T08:47:22+00:00" title="December 22, 2013  8:47AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2013 8:48AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the impetus for the game and/or the story has to come from <i>somewhere</i>. If the GM is not providing it, who or what is? In some games, it's baked into the premise (e.g. the world is ending, and you're the only ones who can save it!). In others (like a "sandbox" game), the impetus has to come from the players. In yet another category are games where the impetus comes from the characters (character goals). <br/><br/>This has to be made clear to the group, somehow, before you play. It's not complicated, but it requires a quick conversation about the style of play and how the game is going to work. You can't have the players sitting around waiting for the GM to throw them a "plot hook" while the GM is sitting there and trying as hard as possible <i>not</i> to do that. Of course everyone's going to go home frustrated.<br/><br/>For instance, for a "sandbox" style game:<br/><br/>"In this game, there is not set 'plot'. You can explore and do whatever you like. So, what do you want to achieve/find/destroy? Ok, now how are you going to go about it? What's the first step in your plan? Great, let's see how it pans out..."<br/><br/>I have no issue with labeling a game or group which does not have this conversation as "bad GMing" (or bad playing!), to stick to the topic of the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426181/#Comment_426181" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-22T08:59:42+00:00" title="December 22, 2013  8:59AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The solution is give the game some direction, wherever you're sitting. idgi                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426185/#Comment_426185" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-22T11:45:24+00:00" title="December 22, 2013 11:45AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2013 12:29PM by catty_big.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You can't have the players sitting around waiting for the GM to throw them a "plot hook" while the GM is sitting there and trying as hard as possible <i>not</i> to do that.

Once that's clear, though, give up (and hopefully do some other fun thing instead)!<br/><br/>Things I might try early on with players who aren't engaging: clarify their role, hype what I think is cool about their role, lead one of them into an example.  So:<br/><br/>"Guys, there are plenty of options out there in my world, each offering different rewards and risks.  Your job is to decide which option appeals to you most, or forge your own that's even better.  I think it'd be fun to see what's in the caravan, or offer your services to the embattled mayor, but you guys don't have to do what I think is fun!  If you'd rather decide that the mayor seems like a dick and hatch a plot to murder him, you totally should!  So, Brad, you've heard my spiel about what's going on in town.  Your character Bloodbeard seems like he's out to make his fortune and earn wealth and fame, above all else.  Is that right?"<br/><br/>"Sure."<br/><br/>"Okay, so, which of the things going on in town gives you the best chance to do that?"<br/><br/>"I dunno."<br/><br/>"Maybe Bloodbeard sees an opportunity to catch the eye of those in power?  The mayor has plenty of money, and many friends."<br/><br/>"I guess."<br/><br/>"You don't seem excited about that.  Would Bloodbeard rather win fame and riches by wresting them from the corpses of his enemies?"<br/><br/>At this point, given a choice between "is your character more like A or B", almost every player will engage, offering some sort of motive or orientation that the GM can work with.  If not, maybe pause for that player and look to see who else seems more interested.  If the rest of the table engages, and you have one problem player, that's survivable.  <br/><br/>If <i>everyone</i> fails to engage, then give up on sandbox.  You did your best!  Time to play a module or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426197/#Comment_426197" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-22T20:15:24+00:00" title="December 22, 2013  8:15PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that's often worked for me is to have plots going on in the sandbox that the players can attach too in a more traditional manner if they want to.
