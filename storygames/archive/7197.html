Not a problem.<br/><br/>Now available is a completely special <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=untaken_address%40yahoo%2ecom&amp;item_name=It%27s%20Complicated%3a%20Online%20Play%20Edition&amp;amount=13%2e00&amp;no_shipping=0&amp;no_note=1&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;lc=US&amp;bn=PP%2dBuyNowBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" rel="nofollow">online edition, tailored specifically for people who prefer to read their texts and play their games online.</a>The online edition is actually a two-part bundle. For $13, you get:<br/><br/>* A full-functionality PDF, with a table of contents you can actually use on the computer-- just click on the chapter you want to go to, and it will take you there. The game is 40 pages long, and there's 15 extensive sticky notes giving further examples and elaborating on game concepts, as well as giving unofficial advice and variations on the rules that I sometimes use when I'm just playing with friends. (That stuff isn't even in the print version.) Not only that, but the text is full of clickable weblinks-- so if you're not familiar with media that I've used for examples, you can go read synopses of them. Even the ads at the back of the PDF will take you directly to the creators' websites.<br/><br/>Along with that, you also get a great java application which automates filling out the game board-- it's perfect for online play. The graphic interface is simple, easy to understand, and even exports the gameboard for upload onto a site like imageshack, or for printing. The vast majority of the playtesting for IC happened on IRC-- it's great for casual play and pick-up games, and the java app is absolutely invaluable for that. You can order the Online Play Edition now, and you'll get it in your inbox as soon as I get the email.<br/> <br/>If you're looking for the basic PDF, you can get it for a mere <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=untaken_address%40yahoo%2ecom&amp;item_name=It%27s%20Complicated%3a%20Basic%20PDF&amp;amount=8%2e00&amp;no_shipping=0&amp;no_note=1&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;lc=US&amp;bn=PP%2dBuyNowBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" rel="nofollow">eight bucks.</a> No links, no notes, not bundled with the java app.<br/><br/>If you want to know more about It's Complicated, you can check out <a href="http://dissolutegames.wordpress.com/its-complicated-a-game-about-messy-lives-and-messy-relationships/" rel="nofollow">my blog</a> or the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6941" rel="nofollow">preorder thread</a> here on Story Games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160327/#Comment_160327" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-02T00:03:31+00:00" title="August  2, 2008 12:03AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds awesome.
