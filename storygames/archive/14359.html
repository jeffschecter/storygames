There are some case studies here pointing out some good and bad trends in UI design, for example.

The Dictionary.com app (which I find useful while writing on my iPad, especially for the Thesaurus), recently made a lot of its buttons smaller. This would be tolerable on a website, where you can use in the built-in ability to zoom in by pinching, but that doesn't happen in most UIs.<br/><br/>Let me make a distinction. The buttons themselves don't need to be big and bulky, the artwork for them can be small and crisp, but they should have plenty of white space around them, so you know you're not tapping something else.<br/><br/>Apple seems to know how to do UI. 3rd party apps seem to know how to provide functions that Apple apps don't (or don't want to). Hopefully we'll see that gap fade more and more as the iPad matures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ldd23" title="ldd23"><img alt="ldd23" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ldd23">ldd23</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326313/#Comment_326313" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T09:57:04+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  9:57AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More specific to RPG books on the iPad, I find that the iPad is not as usable in play as a physical book is. I think this comes down to speed of switching between pages, and it could probably be fixed with well thought out bookmarking features.<br/><br/>In a physical book, I can mark pages and switch between them very quickly, with pretty much one swiping action. In an ebook, I can use my reader's bookmarking feature, but it takes 4-5 taps to switch to a marked page. Bring up the UI, bring up the marked pages, maybe scroll to the page I'm looking for or select through the contents tree, tap to go to the page, tap to put the UI away. If I could access a number of marked pages with a single tap I think I'd find ebooks much more useable at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
