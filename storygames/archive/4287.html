This is a bigger deal in terms of setting than mechanics, but again that's just my perspective.<br/><br/>I suspect that so many people want a "live" game because there's a greater potential for new and/or interested players.  Games that have languished for a long time and "died" are usually harder to obtain copies of and, in a related sense, harder to find people for.  Try to play a pre-<i>Cyberpunk 2020</i> edition of that game and see how difficult it turns out to be, for example.<br/><br/>Granted the availability issue is less of a problem these days when a PDF can provide necessary pages at the click of a button, but with some older, "dead" games it could still be an impediment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96471/#Comment_96471" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T04:13:01+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  4:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the problem stems from the traditional RPG model which is partly to do with the way RPGs evolved and a lot to do with revenue. It has been the case for so long that a publisher would release book A and then back it up with monthly supplements. It worked, people bought the books and the publishers kept doing it. <br/><br/>Now there are new models, like the ones a lot of people here use, the way a game is produced and printed has changed. There is no longer a need for gigantic print runs and then back up books to try and capitalise on the momentum from your initial release. However the majority of people who play RPGs still buy books from the big boys rather than the smaller publishers, and those companies still produce 'splat' books. I think the pereception is that if a new book isn't coming out the company must have lost interest in it. <br/><br/>I think tackling the issue is a matter of making people aware of sites like this one, the Forge, Collective Endeavour where indie games are supported, just not in the traditional sense. Updating websites regularly with new information, actual plays, downloadable content may also help as it does in the computer games industry. Look at bioshock and the 'Cult of rapture' website. The amount of stuff they put up on there which has nothing to do with the playability of the game or sequels is staggering.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96475/#Comment_96475" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T05:02:24+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  5:02AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, I like keeping a small stable of games that I am comfortable with, but I do appreciate the occasional influx of new material to fire up my imagination.<br/><br/>At the same time, I despise the "churn" effect of a game that is constantly in flux, and find there is a certain advantage to games that are no longer supported.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96476/#Comment_96476" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T05:22:20+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  5:22AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah.

The task then becomes finding it, and if there's a lot, sifting it for what you want.  Unofficial support is a big honking mess of often poorly- and half-written ideas.  I've clicked RPG links with glee, thinking I've found something cool, to find only an outline with two sentences and COMING SOON for the rest.  Official support is pretty, and clearly labelled.  And in color!  Sometimes.<br/><br/>Some other reasons: the tactile side of things.  There's something about a book, especially a new book, that excites me in a way that on-line stuff doesn't.  Physical supplements seem more alive.  I can't hold a blog in my hands.  <br/><br/>Books being objects, they can trigger the collector impulse some people (including myself) have.  I like stuff, and have to discipline myself against the consumerist urge to buy, buy, buy.  <br/><br/>There's a dimension of RPGs that gets mentioned only once in awhile, the satisfaction of thinking about play rather than actual play.  New source material, whether official or not, feeds that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96478/#Comment_96478" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T05:27:55+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  5:27AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2007 5:28AM by James Jeffers.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to go a step further.<br/><br/>I think people shun "unsupported" games because they are afraid. They don't want to that one guy who likes that weird, out-of-print game. They want to walk into any social circle and be able to talk about what's hot and what's now. That's what the majority of people are doing at the FLGS, so gosh, if I want friends, I'd better get with it.<br/><br/>I've been turned down many, many times by people who, looking at a game like <i>DragonQuest</i> or even their older editions of a currently in-print game (the edition that they swear they "loved to death" until the new edition came out) don't want to play it. Why? "It's not supported!"<br/><br/>Games aren't good or bad because they are "supported" - I wish more people would understand that. It's meaningless.<br/><br/>If you raised your freak flag laying AD&amp;D, first edition, then I say, freak on, sir. Get out your TMNT Palladium books!

People don't like spending more time on something than they have to to enjoy it, except for the occasional diehard for whom working on that something IS a chunk of the enjoyment. For most this is a hobby, only for a few is it a calling.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Also, people have an easier time on agreeing about new rules if they originate from the guys who wrote the game, rather than someone's house-rules. There's a perception going on that if it's from the author, it has to be playtested better and will operate better just because it's from the same people who wrote it. Thus, it's more likely to be agreed upon when you find someone outside your usual gaming group and invite them to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96487/#Comment_96487" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T07:10:48+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  7:10AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Can't we figure stuff out ourselves?

It basically pointed at the fact that some folks like him (avid, rabid gamers who run or play all the time) need that extra support material to get their brains chugging along. <br/><br/>To the rest of us who can make up our own material on the fly, he says "Hey, seriously, that's awesome. It really must be nice to be you, who can harness the power of your creativity to do that sort of thing. I. Simply. Cannot. I GM not to use my imagination to create "supplement material" on the fly, I use it to run and play an enjoyable game. So please be aware of people like me."<br/><br/>Like, they might be running an L5R game, it's doing ok, but over time it's running out of steam.  Now the new "Naga" book comes out: The "Steve D type" GM picks it up, and if it's written well (they usually are) he now has a ton of new material to draw from, and in this case he *does* draw from it.<br/><br/>Note that this use is not the "read it, put it on the shelf to never bring into the game" that we often see a lot of.

If they can deal with fan-generated support, then the game can last as long as there are fans playing it. It doesn't even die when people stop playing it, it just hibernates. <br/><br/>The problem is, if you're just introducing it to someone new, they're going to wonder why new things aren't coming out for it, and it's all-too-easy to assume that no one wanted to play the game because it sucked. Also, most people don't want to dig around in stores or online to get on the same page as everyone else, when there are games out there still being played that have supplements that are easier to gain access to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96594/#Comment_96594" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T12:27:30+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 12:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that there are conflicting definitions of support and some of them are just odd.  For example, games like Middle Earth Role Playing (MERP) or West End Games' (D6) Star Wars have hundreds of books for them as well as tons of online material -- more than most games will ever produce.  However, some people still call them unsupported because they are out of print.  <br/><br/>Still, I get annoyed at do-it-yourself elitism -- though to be fair it shows up in a lot of hobbies.  i.e. You're not a real model railroader if you just buy prepackaged terrains instead of crafting them yourself.  <br/><br/>Sure, I <i>can</i> compose my own character sheets, craft my own setting and adventures and everything else.  However, I certainly don't think it makes me any less adult to want to have that done for me.  For example, I have known a lot of people who got a lot of mileage out of using other people's designs for town scenarios in Dogs in the Vineyard.  Yet there was a lot of push back at the idea of someone publishing a book of playtested and edited scenarios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96632/#Comment_96632" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T14:31:35+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  2:31PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>What is more supportive of a game?<br/><br/>2.

Back in the dawn time, when we sat huddled in our Internetless homes, 'support' was the new product in the local store.  Books, magazines, maybe the occasional packet of character sheets.  Support as free stuff you get with a few keyboard or mouse clicks is crazy future science fiction.<br/><br/><br/>Another reason for the love of support as new product: the cycle of financial and emotional investment.  If I spent money on it, it's good.  If it's good, I spend money on it.  Even the occasional clinker probably feeds the cycle, since intermittent reinforcement works better than constant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96641/#Comment_96641" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T15:25:32+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  3:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I'm kind of wary about this particular thread.<br/><br/>One of the reasons that I am, really, is because of my difficulty in meaningfully separating what shreyas calls "community" and "support".

If the game isn't supported anymore, it's harder for people to buy, so as time goes by less people will be able to play it. Also, at my age people have the money to have their own rulebooks, so it doesn't make sense to play a game for which one person has the books when you can play one for which everyone has the books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ross" title="ross"><img alt="ross" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/ross_winn/pic/0000syzd"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ross">ross</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96909/#Comment_96909" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T10:27:48+00:00" title="September 17, 2007 10:27AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Players have been trained to expect support, expect it, and value it.

Like Tariq, I think the cornerstone of support is community. People want a community to reach out to for inspiration and sometimes validation. They want new ideas for approaching things, new ways to excite their groups. This can come from product or forum posts.<br/><br/>I suspect this group can be divided into people looking into very specific, directed advice and suggestions for a game, and people who rarely or never get to play but want to talk about games and game concepts to maintain the sense of community and discourse.<br/><br/>2. People want an assurance that they'll be able to find people to play the game with. <br/><br/>Under this rationale, if support equals available product and available product equals popularity, then games with lots of support in the form of lots of product means I'll be able to find people to play with. <br/><br/>Obviously there are a lot of assumptions bound up in that statement, but I think it's representative of the thought process. I suspect this aspect is more common with people who don't get to play often or don't have a group. Taken to an extreme, reading the continual stream of supplemental product can become a stand in for participating in play activity, allowing folks to participate in forums for the community.<br/><br/>Bringing people together to play remains one of the biggest challenges in the hobby.<br/><br/>I think gamer locators, maps and other social networking tools are one of the positive faces of this group.<br/><br/>3. Sometimes, people really just want others to do the grunt work for them. Running games like D&amp;D or Exalted can take a lot of prep and thought! Many people aren't up for switching to a game with less prep, but only have limited time to play. I suspect this is becoming increasingly true as the gaming population ages and gamers' real-life responsibilities increase.<br/><br/>Absent any real numbers, my guess is that these folks have groups, but are struggling to maintain them in the face of other responsibilities and scheduling conflicts. They depend upon scenarios and other tools to lessen their prep burden and allocate more of their available time to actually gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96953/#Comment_96953" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T13:24:11+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  1:24PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas, I understand the distinction you are drawing between support and community, but I suspect a lot of folks who demand support are doing it because they crave community and believe support is a semireliable means of getting it.  That it is also officially endorsed doesn't hurt, either.  But what support does is take this thing that you're interested in and raise it up from something you and your four friends do and make it a broad community of many like-minded people.  In the network of interests, you see new facets of your common love.  Can people do this on their own without the endorsement and treadmill of published material provided by the company?  Sure-- and you can network with all the gamers in Southern California or the Boston area on your own.  But that proactive step of getting things organized, as dirt-simple as the actual task may be, is not something that most folks are up to-- especially if the publisher already has a support community built, and advertised in and through the supplements they publish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96965/#Comment_96965" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T14:09:37+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  2:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>but Steve Darlington made a great counter-rant on RPGNet, basically to the effect of "Stop busting our balls for using support!".

Not as big a deal now.  <br/><br/>And occasionally there's a supplement which turns an existing game in a new, interesting direction.  The example for me will always be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guide to the Technocracy </span>for <i>Mage</i>.  It provided a whole wealth of ideas and rules for turning the rebellious hippie wizard game into the Men in Black game.  Yes, this sounds pretty dumb to me now, but it was an eye-opening delight to me at the time.<br/><br/>Shreyas: I think this is the thread in question:<br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=14503" rel="nofollow">The Myth of Support</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97009/#Comment_97009" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T18:34:25+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  6:34PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That doesn't sound dumb to me even now!<br/><br/>Maybe I am the one who is dumb...<br/><br/>I will ask my wife sometime.<br/><br/>I will tell you her answer accurately - really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97015/#Comment_97015" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T19:00:33+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  7:00PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I guess what I am saying is that while novels can certainly give you ideas, they aren't very good references.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This here, can you unpack?

For me, references will typically be on hand -- and often a question will come up in-game, for things like "What is that section of town like?" or "Is the inn in the same neighborhood as the stonemason's?".  <br/><br/>Like most creative processes, this is something which people approach differently.  Some writers will have copious notes about the culture, languages, geography, and so forth of their story -- often incorporating a lot of research into particular topics.  Other writers sit with only their typewriter and a blank page.  Similarly, some actors will go out and learn about what their character is and does -- often visiting places, reading, and doing activities that connect to the character.  Other actors just freely make things up.  <br/><br/>I think both approaches are valid, but I also think they serve different needs.  <br/><br/>For example, a current campaign that I am GMing is set in 1860s Korea.  I could have just made stuff up rather than using references, but I enjoy bringing in the maps, references, and so forth from real Korea.  It's actually important to me as a Korean to get stuff right.  In lots of other cases it isn't as important, but still enjoyable for me to weave together references with our play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98512/#Comment_98512" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T23:33:32+00:00" title="September 23, 2007 11:33PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So, you seriously, like, have these references <em>at hand</em> when you are playing?</p>\n<p>The mind, it boggles.</p>\n<p>How do you avoid becoming lost in reference?

I appreciate *honest* intertextual work better, where someone admits that bouncing their brains off of something provided them with fun stuff to work with.<br/><br/>Support is about ideas first -- it's just not about obeying them as canon or set rules expansions. I have a feeling that the conversation here is skewed because its participants are self-selected from the set of people interested in communities beyond their own group. When I met fans and talk to them about games, most of them peck bits out of supplements to use in play. The rest hazy a hazier place, as an unstated immersion aid or a way to explore the game from a new angle when things et stale. The exceptions are LARPs and large multiplayer online games, where community becomes more important because the fictional world is the primary basis for your interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98518/#Comment_98518" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T03:43:20+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  3:43AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there is another angle to the whole thing that people seem not to be mentioning:<br/><br/>Lets take the much maligned Serenity RPG as an example.  Community and publishing issues aside, this game was reasonably well received by the majority of people who bought it.  I have a copy myself (as a wealthy/financially irresponsible fan of the TV show and movie it was inevitable) and it's a pretty "meh" trad game.  Nothing special, not bad but nothing to get excited about.  I heard a lot of people on RPG.net complaining that there was no support for the game, and when the line was cancelled after only two supplements (a gm screen and an adventure IIRC) their was outrage from a vocal minority of customers.  Listening to this, the same thing kept coming up over and over: "There are no rules for X", "There's no information on Y", "There are no stats for Z, I was hoping they'd be in the Z Handbook".<br/><br/>Essentially, a lot of games come onto the market with either stuff missing or simply not containing all the material people might want.  Sure, if I wanted to run a Firefly game using a trad system I can make up all the stats for guns or create rules for ship to ship combat (or whatever).  But I really can't be arsed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude" title="Consonant Dude"><img alt="Consonant Dude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6858/fhjfhffblack2iv7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude">Consonant Dude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98523/#Comment_98523" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T04:25:16+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  4:25AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>What is the big damn deal?

Some dude on the Internets may make really cool things that the publisher doesn't.So, like, what makes "Support" so...so...thing?</blockquote>\nAs others have said, it depends what you mean by "support". <br/><br/><b>Support as in, company supports your favorite line</b><br/><br/>I'm not into supplements and things like that. But it makes sense. If you are dearly in love with WoD, Artesia, Warhammer or anything like that... you probably want more stuff. Otherwise, you'd do like me and not bother with setting info.<br/><br/><b>Support as in, company is active and responsive </b><br/><br/>I think this allows many things. The first one is a central service point for official ressources (like the company releasing character sheets, errata, official rulings, new products, etc...) but more importantly, it's a ralllying point for fans, to build a community, exchange new ideas and the like. In term, the company can use this fan material, harvest it and use it in some way. Not to mention all the free publicity.<br/><br/>The second one is that an active company probably has other products going. There's a synergy at work here. You might think Dungeons are lame, but you really like Star Wars roleplaying. Or you might not initially have been interested in Burning Wheel but now, you're drawn to it because you liked Burning Empire. <br/><br/>The third point is peace of mind. I know that if I buy a GURPS product, chances are I will not be disappointed. Now, I was one of those who bought 4th edition and got a faulty binding. We were many. I dropped an email to SJG. I was given a friendly response and things were taken care of. I was sent a new copy pronto. There are few companies that could do this. SJG lost a ton of money in that debacle. This is valuable to me. It makes me trust them sight unseen. Same goes with the level of playtesting and reviewing that goes in their products.   <br/><br/>What do you get when all of these are put together? <br/><br/>The central point releases lots of info on lots of new products. The central point has an active, functional message board. Lots of people ask questions, make suggestions. Community grows. More questions, more answers, more freebies. Fans write or program utilities. Company makes more products, draws more interest and is able to provide better customer service because they have more cash. And so on...<br/><br/><br/>Now, for a few examples, take Hero Games, Green Ronin and Guardians of Order.<br/><br/>There was a time when GoO was the shit. But the website would go down and the release schedule became more and more hectic. And they would provide shitty customer service. The pricing of the books were also considerably off, despite any bullshit they might have said about the rate of exchange.<br/><br/>Eventually, there was a clash between M&amp;M, SAS and Champions. Green Ronin was thriving with a healthy schedule, high quality products and side products (pumping D&amp;D support material). Hero was steadily rebuilding itself up after years of crappy service, thanks to a change of ownership.<br/><br/>Despite cosmetic differences on the surface, SAS and M&amp;M are pretty much the same thing (with the difference being that M&amp;M is overly complicated). Yet M&amp;M quickly crushed its rival thanks to being a much more active and responsive company. <br/><br/>It pays to be an active and responsive company. Or in other words, a company that provides support. It's what fans want. For reasons that are sometimes just emotional but other times very practical. <br/><br/>But I like the indie thinking. Products are more self-contained, so release schedules are not an issue. And despite that, many indie companies go the extra mile to provide stellar support compared to crappy publishers like Margaret Weis, Eden and the now defunct GoO. <br/><br/>A stellar example of a small/middle-size company that understands the viral effects of being an active company is Pinnacle/Great White. I don't like the product (Savage Worlds) but man, do they know how to hype it and create those warm feelings inside their customer base. You feel good, you are supported and in turn, you go out and create more fans. The forum is always active and there is a healthy number of all sorts of cool downloads for your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Jury" title="Adam Jury"><img alt="Adam Jury" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Jury">Adam Jury</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98525/#Comment_98525" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T04:31:57+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  4:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>So, you seriously, like, have these references <em>at hand</em> when you are playing?The mind, it boggles.How do you avoid becoming lost in reference?

Let's rephrase that question: Assuming you are giving out the right information in a timely manner within your game, does the source of that information matter?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98531/#Comment_98531" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T05:05:16+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  5:05AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>This is like, WAY past the thrust of the thread, but whatever.</p>\n<p>I think it does matter, immensely.

It is no good.</blockquote>\nFirst of all, yes, we do play with the references on hand.  And yes, we will open them up and refer to them from time to time.  Some more prominent references, like a map of the city we're in, are often continuously on the table.  As for being lost in them, my experience differs from yours in that we don't become lost in them.  I don't have any particular techniques for this -- I think just having a game more interesting than the references keeps us coming back.  <br/><br/>I suspect your judgement of what is "no good" is just a preference -- similar to what you consider to be "excess information" or "extraneous authors".  <br/><br/>Different people will judge information based on their tastes.  For example, some people may prefer to skip over visual descriptions of NPCs or monsters, while for others it adds to their vision of play.  <br/><br/>Similarly, I don't think there is any number of authors that are perfectly right.  Yes, a group of people can play with no outside input -- they create the game system for themselves along with the background, characters, and situation.  However, I think it is not extraneous for them to take someone else's setting to play in with their homebrew system -- or conversely to use someone else's game system to play in their homebrew setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98863/#Comment_98863" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T04:01:11+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  4:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed I do play with references on hand, for use when something comes up that I don't know in advance. If I know my players will be making a ballista during the session I will know how they work and how far they fire in advance and will feel quite happy pulling numbers from the air when needed.<br/><br/>On the other hand if the ballista comes up unexpectedly in play and someone asks me how far it can fire and I don't know then yes, I will often reach for a reference book to tell me (it helps to play at home). Now I could certainly also make up a figure but my players (like a lot of players) are die hard simulationists and prefer the correct answer. They care if the range given is the actual range of a historical ballista or not, so we use the materials on hand to work it out.<br/><br/>In contrast I would very rarely turn to reference materials for something where realism was not an issue, unless we are working with previously established facts. I'm unlikley to look at a map to find out if there is an inn round the corner, but I will look at the map when they ask how far they are from the previously established inn  that has appeared in the game before. That's more a matter of consistency than accuracy though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
