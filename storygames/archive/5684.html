Anyway, I just wanted to see what people thought of it initially.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe history of the gods starts in the year 2000 B.C.E.  The Indus Valley is at the height of its power.  The Minoans are their equal but rivals stir silently, waiting for the chance to gather power.  The Third Dynasty of Ur has come to a close, temporarily weakening Mesopotamia, the ancient cradle of mortal civilization.  The gods strike without fear, for monotheism is a sheathed sword, far from the minds of most humans.  However, doubt has crept into their minds.  For now, it is a vague murmur.  Humanity has begun its march toward rationalism, the other dagger destined to slay the gods.  It is prophesized the worship of one will supplant the worship of many.  Finding out the name of the one god has been futile; the identity of this being takes on the name of the seeker.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach pantheon is like a human family, full of love but strife as well.  Factions have begun to split apart the ancient gods.  The Greeks split themselves among the Minoan camp (those who seek the peaceful co-existence of gods and mortals) vs. the Mycenaean camp (those who want to strike first and fight for the superiority of the Grecian way of life).  Rumors of invasion from the Aryans manage to stave off actual war.  Instead, the gods of the Indus valley are in a cold war, battling for the minds and hearts of the people living in that region.  The death of Ur-III has left an opening for the gods of Mesopotamia to war with one another.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPolitical infighting and battle are the way of the gods at this time.  They do not normally seek to slay one another in one engagement.  They are beings that have lived for billions of years.  Instead, they use mortals and semi-divine creatures to work their will.  Their power is great but generates clamor.  Too much use lets all of the other gods know what they are doing.  One false step can lead to banishment from the pantheon or worse.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
