One is that I haven't run a game probably since around 1990 or so, so I need the game to be reeeeeally simple so that I can concentrate on running a good game rather than looking up rules. The second thing is that I want to do a story game, with a group who have mixed experience: I have played Universalis, FATE based games and idly read a number of 'indie' games another player is an indie game veteran, another has played a couple and the third none at all.<br/><br/>I thought maybe I would like to try something horror/zombie based or perhaps something a little weird, such as Don't Rest Your Head but I'm not too set on a specific genre. What do you think would be a good one to get my head round? I am particularly looking for ultra-simple rules and interesting ways story-telling is encouraged, having had fun playing Once Upon a Time. My first thought was to use The Pool, but I think maybe I'm looking for something with a background or genre already set so it's easy for me to spell out what the game is about quickly. I'm looking for anything that will help me run a game without worrying about too many things at once.<br/><br/>Any ideas would be very gratefully received.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406238/#Comment_406238" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T13:56:55+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  1:56PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2013 1:57PM by Edmoo.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Pendelume!<br/><br/>I would thoroughly recommend Cuthulhu Dark - it's pretty much designed exactly for that purpose. It's made so that you can run any old Cuthulhu scenario with it, and it bloody works. We've been campaigning it lately, just because we enjoyed our one-shot so damn much.<br/><br/>Also, I'm obliged to mention my new game, Screenplay - I've just released it, and it's all about making up a zombie film. It's a card game, kinda similar to Once Upon a Time. It's a pretty clear match to what you described, but it's also in beta testing, so you might prefer something more established...<br/><br/>Welcome back to the world's most awesome hobby <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406239/#Comment_406239" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T14:00:26+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  2:00PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zombie Cinema fits the bill exactly!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406240/#Comment_406240" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T14:00:59+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  2:00PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2013 2:01PM by horn_head_o.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used Lady Blackbird as my tool to get myself into running story games - it's very easy, and you already know about The Pool, which is one of the roots of Lady Blackbird. And LB is free!<br/>And the Keys promote interesting and different takes at the story depending on how the player takes it. It's one of my absolute favorite games.<br/><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">LINK TO LADY BLACKBIRD</a><br/><br/>Something I've used more recently for easing some of my group into doing more GM-y things was playing Fiasco. Everyone acts as a GM to some degree, letting you ease into framing provocative scenes, but you're not being looked to by everyone to respond to their actions. You get some experience, but without the heat on you (or at least the heat is evenly distributed). Plus, the rules really get out of the way - it's a hell of a lot of improv gaming rather than rules interference.<br/>You could probably find a good Horror playset, and they introduced a Zombie playset add-on not too long ago.<br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/" rel="nofollow">LINK TO FIASCO'S WEBSITE</a><br/><br/>These aren't particularly creative solutions (they're both really popular here and in general), but hope you find something you like!<br/><br/>EDIT: Zombie Cinema was also on my list of potential recommendations, but I haven't actually played.

Which one to choose.... thanks for these ideas. A few pages of rules and some interesting story-making rules are great. Maybe not creative to long-time users, but very approachable for me. I had read through things like Agon, but even short games like that I think are too much for me to cope with.

play it. For example, the crucial thing of having the characters working against each other isn't explained anywhere. (But perhaps I remember it wrong?)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I would say InSpectres or perhaps Lady Blackbird because the GM hardly have to do any work in those games. InSpectres was written to play Call of Cthulhu the right way, but it tends to be more like Ghostbusters the gonzo way.<br/><br/>But what I really can suggest is to lower your bar. To GM is a skill like anything else, and like all skills you need practise to maintain. You can't be a masterful GM just by doing the right preparations - you also have to put it in practise over and over again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406333/#Comment_406333" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T13:59:33+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  1:59PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird is a really good choice.

Since a SG is a much more collaborative effort than a traditional RPG, having these guys/gals actively contributing will take most of the GM load off you (and encourage your other players to contribute more too).  IMO this will give you more breathing space than focusing on super-lightweight rules.<br/><br/>Sometimes super-light rules require skilled players to engage with in a meaningful way and can feel flat compared with a traditional RPG if people try to engage with them on a "system mastery" basis. Obviously don't try to run any system that you're uncomfortable with but there is some middle ground in terms of the ideal rules (and this varies from group to group and individual to individual).<br/><br/>rgds<br/>rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doc%20Halloween" title="Doc Halloween"><img alt="Doc Halloween" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j28/DocHalloween/32x32_tiny_logo.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doc%20Halloween">Doc Halloween</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406393/#Comment_406393" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T05:54:59+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  5:54AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2013 5:55AM by Doc Halloween.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have tons of RPG systems.

I have been thinking hard about what's best and I certainly take the point that rules-light might well make the game itself more difficult to GM - I think I am lucky in that I have a supportive group to play with.<br/><br/>At the moment I think I am going to start with a Cthulhu Dark session and see how it goes, and if all goes well try the Alien Survivor Lady Blackbird hack. The players I have are keen to help me GM so are happy to go with what I will feel comfortable running, which is a great help for me.<br/><br/>There are some great suggestions here - I intend to get hold of a copy of Zombie Cinema if I can. I personally do like systems with compressed rules, but interesting mechanics so Fiasco is also on my list to read. I used to hate the idea of what I considered a set of rules which attempted to constrict choices but now see that focus on providing a structure as a good thing: tonight we're going to play a game about..... and these rules help us do that. Sort of Oulipian?<br/><br/>Thank you for these suggestions and pointers - I hope my return to GMing will go well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
