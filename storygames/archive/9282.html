I've heard back from 6 separate groups, 8 if you include the ones I've been involved with directly, and a couple of other people have given me some useful feedback from reading the text alone. <br/><br/>I realise that since then I've been a bit remiss in keeping everyone updated on what's going on. So I thought I would use this thread to try and start an open discussion on what worked, what didn't, and what needs to happen next. Everyone is welcome to contribute, whether you are a playtester or just an interested observer.  <br/><br/><b>The Good</b><br/><br/>The game fundamentally works. Everyone seemed to have fun with it, even those who tend to prefer other, more traditional sorts of games. No-one reported any problems with the system breaking down or their players walking away in disgust or anything. So that's good. <br/><br/>A couple of noteworthy points: <br/><br/>Group worldbuilding worked out well. People seemed to really appreciate the chance to have a say in the kind of setting they would be exploring. A lot of groups seemed to end up using it to build some kind of space opera - this is nice for me because I'm going to be producing a space opera supplement, but I'm not quite sure why they were so popular over the other options. Anyway, we also had a couple of horror games and a very intriguing world war 2 mecha/alien invasion game. I don't think there have been any wild west or superhero games yet. <br/><br/>Character generation went reasonably smoothly. A couple of things weren't explained as clearly as they should have been (prologue abilities in particular) but I've fixed that now. No-one seemed to have any particular difficulties creating their own templates, which was something I was worried about. The nature of the game is such that some level of DIY is always going to be needed, so it's important that the text has enough examples/support to make this possible. <br/><br/>People really seemed to like the spotlight points system, my group included. We're playing D&amp;D 4e right now and they still jokingly give out feedback tokens to each other when someone does something cool. As GM I also like the way the whole system runs on autopilot and doesn't require me to judge the relative worth of people's contributions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205474/#Comment_205474" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T16:30:02+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  4:30PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Bad</b><br/><br/>There were no major problems, which is good, but a few issues came up that I'd like to address: <br/><br/>1) The Maths Problem<br/>Some people seemed to have difficulty with the maths involved in the system. It wasn't that it was difficult so much as that it slowed things down when there were a lot of 10% support modifiers to calculate. <br/><br/>I'm not really sure there's a lot I can do about this one - the high level of granularity is an inherent part of the<br/>system. I think part of this problem may come from people not knowing when to stop in terms of using supporting abilities, so maybe there's more I can do to address this issue in the general play advice parts of the text.<br/><br/>2) The Luck Problem<br/>Some people felt that the system was too swingy - i.e. that the dice played too large a part in deciding what happens. They wanted having a higher rating, or a higher number of relevant abilities, to be more decisive in terms of locking up the conflict for that side.<br/><br/>In all honesty this one is kind of deliberate. I wanted conflicts to be exciting and unpredictable. I like the fact that the underdog always has a shot and that you never quite know what's going to happen 'til it happens. <br/><br/>Note also that this issue is ameliorated somewhat by the spotlight points system. Between reversing the polarity of the dice and raising the stakes for a reroll, players actually have a pretty good chance of being able to force through a particular outcome on the issues that really matter to them. So I don't think this is actually that big an issue. <br/><br/>3) The Variability Problem<br/>A couple of people didn't like the fact that most abilities will tend to have very similar ratings. They wanted more opportunities to customise their ratings during character generation. <br/><br/>I'm in two minds about this. On the one hand a bit more customisation would be a good thing; on the other hand, it's yet more complexity during both character generation and conflict resolution (calculating support modifiers). I'm also wary of giving people too many opportunities to sacrifice their 'interesting background' type abilities in favour of their 'cool power' type abilities. I've actually been playing around with an alternative method of determining ratings that goes some way towards addressing all of these issues, but I'd be interested to hear any other views first. . <br/><br/>4) The Too Many Abilities Problem<br/>Some people felt that their characters simply had too many abilities. For some, this was mainly a problem during character generation - they found it difficult thinking up enough traits to fill the slots. For others, it was mainly a problem during conflict resolution itself - this really ties in with the Maths Problem, above. <br/><br/>I think to a large extent this issue is pretty much unavoidable; creating and playing detailed characters is simply an inherent part of the game. But perhaps there are ways it can be managed more smoothly. <br/><br/>I do have some thoughts on all these problems and (I think) some pretty solid ideas on how to address them. But I'm going to hold fire for a little bit and see if we can get a bit of open discussion going first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205476/#Comment_205476" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T16:31:43+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  4:31PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Known Unknowns</b><br/><br/>There are a couple of other issues that didn't come up in any of the playtest feedback as far as I'm aware, but that I wanted to ask people about anyway. <br/><br/>Does the game still work at very low (10) and very high (50) power levels?<br/><br/>Does the game break down if players put all their points into the same ability, or set of abilities, to the expense of all others? <br/><br/>Does the game break down if players just buy loads of different abilities rather than improving or changing any of their existing ones?<br/><br/>Did anyone actually give out spotlight points for player's narrative contributions, and if so what was the result? <br/><br/>How often did your players tend to buy temporary abilities after winning a conflict?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205509/#Comment_205509" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T18:02:32+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  6:02PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: soviet</cite>2) The Luck Problem<br/>Some people felt that the system was too swingy - i.e. that the dice played too large a part in deciding what happens.

Having lots of abilities that can all modify the same roll is the basic foundation of the game. The problem is, how do you absorb all these little details and modifiers into your system without letting them become dominant? How many +1 bonuses do you need to accumulate in a 2d10 or 3d6 system before your victory becomes practically guaranteed? <br/><br/>My solution was to 'go big' and use a d100. The advantage of having such a high level of granularity is that it lets people bring in as many supporting abilities and other details as they like without substantially altering the odds of the situation. Yes, the relatively limited effect of support modifiers is entirely deliberate. They're not really there to help people win conflicts, they're there to help encourage people to narrate things about their character and how they plug into the situation at hand. <br/><br/>The way I think about resolution in Other Worlds is basically: a coin flip, with weighting. That weighting being for things like power level, relative advantage, and interesting narration. I'm not interested in trying to simulate anything. I'm just interested in identifying two different directions the story could go in and then randomly determining which one takes place. <br/><br/>That may not be what you want from a system, of course. But that's the intention behind it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206207/#Comment_206207" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T20:06:49+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  8:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure that the 10% math was very hard for my group.

Limiting ability adds wouldn't solve that, and that's not a solution I'd strive for. I like it when people had a ton of abilities to add in. Each one allowed the player to further get invested in the conflict. And when doing single roll contests, it's a great way to build up the suspense and anticipation of the ultimate conclusion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brennen Reece</cite>For example, I'm a pretty good artist and a professional musician. There's absolutely no way I'm going to accidentally draw a stick figure or forget a G chord. I might fuck up the foreshortening of the foot at a certain angle, but most people wouldn't notice, and they'd still buy the painting.</blockquote>\nI'd suggest a reframing. Why have a character roll for something they aren't going to screw up?  The drawing or performance may still be critical, but instead of the roll determining the quality of the outcome (or at least anything more than an off foot or slightly dischord note) it can determine how much the person is going to pay for the painting, or whether the audience, or even better, single person in the audience, is impressed.  So, you can still have the roll, if the action is important, but make the success and failue something that's equally important. Instead of something that makes the character look bad, or unskilled, or silly.<br/><br/>I didn't have a problem with it being swingy. It would be nice if the numbers weren't do big, but that's mainly due to juggling all the figures. The final conflict in the big game I ran, well it would have sucked if they failed. But they threw everything they had at it.  I think they ended up with something like a 120 bonus. Even with a pretty poor roll, they succeeded (I also didn't have a great roll, but their margin of failure was small anyway). But even if they failed, it wouldn't have been an impossibile result, it would have just turned it into a tragedy, and possibly have been disappointing for the player who was leading the final skill roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206256/#Comment_206256" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T08:16:28+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  8:16AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I recall from my admittedly brief playtest...the pool of d20s method didn't have this problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206492/#Comment_206492" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T13:55:19+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  1:55PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>I'm not sure that the 10% math was very hard for my group.

With HQ/QW, if you knew that the GM got a 'success with a 12', or whatever, you also knew exactly what you needed to roll to beat it. The very second that the dice stopped moving, everyone at the table knew straightaway what the final result was. "9, yes, he's dead!", "Shit, 15, I'm dead!", and so on.<br/><br/>With Other Worlds that is lessened slightly because it takes a couple of seconds for the two sides to add up and compare their respective results. One solution I found (which will find its way into the text) is that the GM should always roll first, announcing their final total as the 'score to beat' before the player even picks up the dice. The idea being that this builds the suspense even further and puts the final outcome of the conflict entirely in the (literal) hands of the player. "OK, so Sauron got 157 on his mace swing. You've gotta beat that to dodge him and escape". <br/><br/>I wonder if it might also be advisable to do some of the maths at this stage as well, so we return to the 'instant reaction to the roll' thing we get from HQ/QW. "Your total modifier is +72, so that means an 85 is a tie and anything higher is a victory". Although I think that would generally make things go more smoothly in play, it does seem to look much more complicated when I actually try and write it down. Maybe I'll put it in as a 'GM Pacing Tip' or something rather than an explicit part of the CR rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206493/#Comment_206493" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T14:02:23+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  2:02PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/><br/>I know you're not keen on using the d20 pool method, but I'd sure like to see it anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206494/#Comment_206494" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T14:05:24+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  2:05PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2009 2:06PM by soviet.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>As I recall from my admittedly brief playtest...the pool of d20s method didn't have this problem.</blockquote>\nThe problem with the d20 dice pool system is that it doesn't exist.

I'm not a big fan of dice pools, partly because they average out the results too much (I like my swinginess!) but also because they can interfere with the 'instant reaction to the roll' thing outlined above.

I don't get the impression that people tended to give out points for this very often anyway (my group certainly didn't). The first sign of a bad or unnecessary rule is that no-one actually remembers to implement it (see also: encumbrance systems). So that's strike one. <br/><br/>Particularly good contributions will tend to be reinforced by the group as a whole in the form of feedback points anyway. This change simply removes the GM from being in a position of authority over what is an approved contribution and what isn't. I really like the idea of having the reward system entirely adjudicated by the other players (the audience) rather than the GM. So, strike 2. <br/><br/>Strike 3 (this never came up, but it could): this also removes the possibility of people narrating stuff just for 'the money' rather than because they think it's a cool addition to the world. Player: "Oh shit, Sauron charges at me? OK, I need a spotlight point. Did I ever tell you about the knitting techniques of the ancient Numenoreans? Well, first they started with a needle made out of purest laen..." Other Players: "Zzz..." GM: "Have your point and get on with it man!". <br/><br/>Imagining new stuff and making it a part of the established setting should be its own reward.

Currently you get three defining traits - one at +10 and two at +5. Some people have said that they didn't think this was enough scope for customisation. I think I agree with them. The challenge here is to allow for greater customisation without making chargen too complicated and without incentivising people to sacrifice their 'interesting background' abilities in favour of their 'cool powers' abilities. There is also the issue that lots of abilities with fiddly ratings (27, 31, etc) make the maths of the system that touch more involved. Here's the solution I'm trying:  <br/><br/><b>Templates</b><br/><br/>The abilities in your character's templates represent fundamental truths about his upbringing and general disposition that he cannot hide from; this stuff is in his blood. Most of these abilities will therefore start at the full maximum allowable rating for your game. <br/><br/>Pick one ability from each template as a defining trait and add +5 to it. This represents those parts of your character's training and upbringing that struck a particular nerve and that have come to play a dominant role in his life. <br/><br/><b>Individuality</b><br/><br/>The abilities derived from your character's individuality do not benefit from the same levels of cultural reinforcement as those from his templates. As a result, their ratings tend to be a lot more variable. Some of these abilities will represent things that are very important to the character, such as specialist skills, intimate relationships, and driving ambitions, while others will represent more minor traits such as hobbies, casual acquaintances, and vague aspirations. <br/><br/>Pick three defining strengths from your individuality; add +10 to one and +5 to the other two. These should be the things that you judge to be most important to your overall character concept or that you want to focus on the most during play. <br/><br/>Then, pick three defining weaknesses from your individuality; subtract 10 from one and 5 from the other two. These represent the things he is not so good at or the things you are not so interested in. In some cases - volatile relationships, double-edged personality traits, etc - a lower rating might actually turn out to be a blessing in disguise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207736/#Comment_207736" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-16T14:14:21+00:00" title="May 16, 2009  2:14PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>3) Reduce the size of the templates</b><br/><br/>This one I'm not 100% sure of. I'm considering reducing the size of all the templates from 8 general abilities, 4 personality traits, and 4 relationships to 6 general abilities, 3 personality traits, and 3 relationships. <br/><br/>The intention is that this will make character generation a bit easier - particularly when you are creating your own templates. It will also make play run a bit more smoothly because it will mean everyone has fewer abilities to keep track of. It will also make it easier to fit the character sheet onto a single sheet of paper!<br/><br/>I think that 6/3/3 is still enough room for templates to have a real sense of character and depth, and also for players to be able to put in all kinds of colourful details without feeling like they have wasted a slot. <br/><br/>I certainly don't want to reduce the number of abilities any further than this, BTW, or push Other Worlds any closer towards becoming a 'small handful of big traits game' like Over the Edge or PTA. I like the fact that the characters in my game have tons of abilities - it really feels like we know them (and the world they come from) to a satisfyingly high level of detail. It's almost like the sense of verisimilitude you get from something like Rolemaster, only we're using words and story hooks instead of numbers and charts.<br/><br/>I hope that comparing my game to Rolemaster doesn't come back to haunt me, BTW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207737/#Comment_207737" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-16T14:15:43+00:00" title="May 16, 2009  2:15PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And finally...<br/><br/><b>4) Change the supporting abilities system</b><br/><br/>This one might be a bit controversial. Basically, the game is set up to give players a high level of freedom in choosing supporting abilities for their conflicts. The assumption is that players will use their discretion and only go on a big trawl for every last +1 when the conflict is important enough to spend that much time on. <br/><br/>I don't think this always works out so well in practice. Some groups (mine included) seemed to have difficulty in knowing when to stop, and conflicts could easily slow down to a crawl if GMs weren't aggressive enough in pushing their players to get on with it. I think this problem is actually a large contributing factor to the Maths Problem and the 'Too Many Abilities' Problem described in the OP. <br/><br/>My proposed solution is as follows: Players can only describe a maximum of 3 supporting abilities per conflict. That's enough detail to make things interesting but not so much that it bogs down play. <br/><br/>However, this doesn't solve the problem that sometimes it really is appropriate to use everything and the kitchen sink, whether it's the final duel of the campaign or merely something of great personal significance to the character (or even the player). I don't think it's appropriate for the GM to stand in judgement of these issues, nor for the player to feel like they have to justify themselves and their behaviour to the rest of the group. <br/><br/>Therefore, players can spend a spotlight point to literally Spotlight a Conflict and temporarily ignore this restriction, taking the time to show off all the cool abilities and modifiers that their character possesses. This keeps the discretion about when to go 'all out' in the hands of the player but also ensures that it won't happen all of the time. I think it also gives it some value as a clear statement of investment in the conflict and in effect gives the player direct authority to spend some additional time describing his character's involvement. <br/><br/><b>5) Tie temporary abilities into spotlighting conflicts, above</b><br/><br/>My players felt that buying temporary abilities sounded cool but wasn't really worth it. So a further idea I've been toying with is to roll it in with the Spotlighting a Conflict thing above. When you spend the point, not only do you get as many supporting ability modifiers as you can describe, you also get a free temporary ability if you end up winning the conflict. <br/><br/>This serves to emphasise the fact that the character has a personal investment in the outcome. I think it also makes spotlighting conflicts a bit more worthwhile for those characters who might not have that many additional supporting abilities to bring online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone" title="angelo.pampalone"><img alt="angelo.pampalone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone">angelo.pampalone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207775/#Comment_207775" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T07:33:45+00:00" title="May 17, 2009  7:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: soviet3) Reduce the size of the templates<br/>\n<br/>\nI like these change, I think a +5 would not change the overall game but give a nice focus for the player.<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted By: soviet3) Reduce the size of the templates<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!<br/>\nWell, maybe..., I like the 8/4/4 and two of my player found the templates room not enough so the used their individuality to add the abilities that can\u2019t fit into a template.

I actually discussed with my group in Montreal just establishing the base level of the world, and then letting players put a 5 point shifts on whole templates. i.e. - You can have it at 30 (world base), or drop one to 25 and the other goes to 35.

If people use or adapt the templates that are provided in the book (and there are a reasonably high number of these), I guess the amount of abilities they contain is largely immaterial. When people create their own templates, however, it can make a difference. I guess those 4 abilities just make it look that little bit more challenging. <br/><br/>I know that when I've created templates for the genre snapshots in the book, sometimes I have struggled to come up with the last couple of abilities (particularly relationships). But then I've also sometimes struggled to fit all my ideas into the space available, so it goes both ways. I recently created a couple of 6/3/3 templates for an upcoming playtest game involving pirates, and it did feel different. Easier, but shallower too perhaps.<br/><br/>Number two is complexity in conflict resolution - not only in terms of slowing the game down by looking for every last supporting ability, but also in terms of the maths involved to calculate all the little 10% bonuses. These issues are now pretty well addressed by the 'Maximum of 3 supporting abilities' rule described earlier, so maybe the move to 6/3/3 is not as relevant as it once might have been. <br/><br/>I think what I will do is try out the 6/3/3 templates in the pirates game (we've already built all the characters) and see if it feels any different. It might be tricky to disassociate the effect of the smaller templates from the effects of the support mods change, but I have a couple of other small playtests on the horizon too if I need to isolate them. <br/><br/>Man, character sheets are a problem for the 8/4/4 version though. It's a lot of stuff to try and fit on one sheet of paper -  the average character has 69 separate abilities!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208214/#Comment_208214" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T16:31:48+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  4:31PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lightcastle</cite><br/>I like the suggestion of highlight one from each template, with more variability in the individuals.

Right from the word go, their characters were very well defined. What this meant was that they helped to dictate the overall tone of the game more than the others, in terms of setting up potential NPCs and situations for them to interact with later. It also meant that they got more conflicts specifially targetted to their traits during the first few sessions.  <br/><br/>One other player in particular, however, left a lot of his individuality slots open. The result was that the campaign didn't revolve around him nearly as much, at least initially, because there was less there for me to build off as the GM. BUT, it gave him a lot more flexibility to respond to the situations that developed in play. He had more free slots to take relationships to newly introduced NPCs and generally find new solutions to the problems that were being put in front of him. <br/><br/>It was sort of like the difference between actively carving yourself a niche in the story on the one hand, and simply reacting to the story that develops around you on the other hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone" title="angelo.pampalone"><img alt="angelo.pampalone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone">angelo.pampalone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208248/#Comment_208248" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T00:53:08+00:00" title="May 20, 2009 12:53AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fell the same effect in my current campaign the players with a complete sheet are the one more firmly rooted in the campaign world and is easier to create story that poke their connection on the other hand, the other 2 players are more flexible and have a easier time adapting to new situations                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone" title="angelo.pampalone"><img alt="angelo.pampalone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone">angelo.pampalone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209039/#Comment_209039" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T02:04:38+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  2:04AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, I'm developing a race with a nature/element affinity.<br/>\nWhen one member of this s race is in a forest he'll gain some forest traits.

I had a similar situation with a shapeshifter character in the victorian horror game I did last year. <br/><br/>The conundrum here is in flexibility versus flavour. All the flavour is in the specific terrain types, but you don't want to have a template that just consists of lots of little packets of abilities that are too specific and can never be combined. You also don't want a totally generic set of abilities that just feels really bland and uninspiring in actual play. <br/><br/>I would say the way to do it is build about half the template to be terrain-agnostic and the other half to be terrain-specific. Yeah, this means you will never be able to use all of the abilities at once, but then you can't do that with most other templates either. This means that in any given situation or terrain type,  just over half of the abilities in the template will be potentially online. <br/><br/>In the generic half try to really get at the heart of what it is these affinity guys do. How do their powers work, what does it look like when they use them, what kind of things do they generally use their powers for, etc. Try to make these abilities pretty open-ended, so that they inspire the player to find creative uses for them in different types of terrain. I'm thinking of stuff like Chameleonic Skin, Adapt To Environment, Resist Elements, Move Through Terrain, Embody Local Strengths, Channel Nature's Wrath, Understand Ecosystem, etc. <br/><br/>In the terrain-specific you can really go nuts with the flavour. Make them as specific and as colourful as you can. You can either have a bunch of different environments represented with one ability each, or focus on one specific kind of home turf. I'm thinking of stuff like Meld Into Snow, Heal Tree, Walk On Wind, Spit Lava, etc. <br/><br/>Personality traits and relationships sort of depend on who these guys are and how they get their powers. Are they elementals? Druids? People who have communed with faerie spirits and swore terrible oaths? People who work with nature and try to protect it? People who draw on the power of nature and exploit it? You could also pick traits that are based on specific terrain types - Erupts Into Anger, Steady As A Rock, Flighty, Tranquil, etc. In any event I am assuming that this is a trademark template and not a culture or profession. <br/><br/>I certainly wouldn't want to change the basic rules of the game so that the abilities were in constant flux, or dictated by the GM. I think the solution needs to be a simple and consistent set of traits that can be applied as needed. <br/><br/>But then I suppose I would say that, wouldn't I? :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone" title="angelo.pampalone"><img alt="angelo.pampalone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone">angelo.pampalone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209199/#Comment_209199" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T01:46:11+00:00" title="May 27, 2009  1:46AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Soviet, this will be a trademark template for a race in my ongoing campaign.

So the character would still get cold and aloof in the arctic, and fiery and volatile near to a volcano, but this would be represented by using the same abilities in different ways rather than actually changing the nature of the abilities themselves.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone" title="angelo.pampalone"><img alt="angelo.pampalone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/angelo.pampalone">angelo.pampalone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210851/#Comment_210851" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T05:56:56+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  5:56AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            sorry for not replying before, too much rl.<br/>\nIn the spare time I'm working on a template with Sovuet suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
