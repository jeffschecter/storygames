Just a few seconds later, as I was looking through Rickard\u2019s game Matin\xe9 (which I found when I was searching for information on the initiative board he mentioned recently), I found a discussion about fortune-in-the-middle again! Weird how a concept I haven\u2019t thought about for years show up twice \u2014 kind of unrelated \u2014 within a minute.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought about this and I thought I should clarify.<br/>What I dislike isn\u2019t:<br/>Mechanical choices \u2192 Fortune \u2192 Desc<br/><br/>It\u2019s<br/>Mechanical choices \u2192 Fortune \u2192 More mechanical choices \u2192 Desc<br/>(Such as \u201cboosting\u201d a die roll with points, or rerolling. I\u2019d rather the system asked me to bet the points before the roll.)<br/><br/>I don\u2019t really have a convincing argument for my case, it\u2019s just my own preference, to leave the final outcome in the hand of fate.<br/><br/>Anyway, Rickard, you describe<br/>Vague desc  \u2192 Fortune \u2192 Precise desc.<br/>Some games and system work better that way. The familiar design choice between \u201cconflict resolution\u201d vs \u201cspecific action resolution\u201d and games need to be upfront about it. Such as Hero Wars or FFG\u2019s WFRP 3, they need this flow and we had to re-learn when we played WFRP 3.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t mind it \u2014 it\u2019s not my preference, but it\u2019s not what I meant when I wrote \u201cI don\u2019t like fortune-in-the-middle\u201d.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436193/#Comment_436193" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T13:34:02+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  1:34PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you want the die roll to be the final resolution mechanic.

It's actually "Mechanical choices \u2192 Fortune \u2192 More mechanical choices \u2192 Desc", like you said. I dunno what Matin\xe9 is. It's how I game master games like <b>Feng Shui</b>, <b>InSpectres</b> and now also <b>This Is Pulp</b>. It's a method I worked out for making the players' describe their actions (without having to rely on mechanical rewards).<br/><br/>I actually think <b>WFRPG 3</b> works better without "Vague description -&gt; Fortune -&gt; Detailed description", and instead focusing on the result of the game mechanics. Otherwise you will get a clunky mash of "focusing on the game mechanics" and "focusing on the descriptions". It's my experience that you can't combine those two. <b>Burning Wheels</b> is another example where it doesn't work, according to my preferences.<br/><br/>I should also add that I don't like "Mechanical choices \u2192 Fortune \u2192 More mechanical choices \u2192 Desc" from my viewpoint as a game designer. It's a faulty game mechanics\u2014a fix for something that doesn't work\u2014just like "...with teeth" is. I can't even think of any successful games that had that kind of clunky game mechanic. Possibly <b>Stoneage</b>, but it's a fix for those pesky dice rolls (they shouldn't exist in strategic games). It's the reason I don't like fate points in WFRPG 2. If you created a game that kills you too easily, don't try to throw in points so they don't die too quickly. Fix the real problem instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436198/#Comment_436198" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T13:56:16+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  1:56PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All three versions of WFRPG are whiff fests and I do not like them for that reason.
