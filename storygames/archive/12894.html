I'm assuming I'm playing with a hetero guy, but the other player could be anyone and have any preference imaginable. I may have totally just presented the other player with a completely "wrong" lover. I wonder if it matters. Do  any of you think the lover needs to be specifically pointed at the tastes of the hero player? In reading Paul Czege's AP, he notes that his wife tried to make the lover his "type," and I thought that was interesting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290252/#Comment_290252" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T23:50:42+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 11:50PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 11:52PM by Hans_c-o.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: docholaday</cite>Do  any of you think the lover needs to be specifically pointed at the tastes of the hero player?</blockquote>\nNah. I don't know the romantic proclivities of anyone I've played with (nor even, for sure, the sexual orientation of people--because who knows until you find out, right?), and I don't think it mattered. In one game we had a woman heroine and a woman lover. I think all the other games have been straight guy-girl match-ups, but I dunno, it's hard for me to believe that if you've read S/lay and liked it enough to want to play it, that you're going to be shocked by gay romance in the game.<br/><br/>I guess that was all a tangent to your question, but it's an extreme example (extreme in the sense of "you might get the romantic tastes of your partner so wrong that you've chosen the wrong gender!") to show that I don't think it matters. I think you have to try to make the lover interesting &amp; sympathetic &amp; attractive, which is hard. It's hard to get the hero to stay, in my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290329/#Comment_290329" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T07:58:13+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  7:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2010 7:58AM by docholaday.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans chung-otterson</cite>...

Just to clarify, I wouldn't be shocked by that and I wouldn't be bothered by playing it out. I was worried about trying to hit the other player's buttons. As you said, I want to make the lover interesting, sympathetic, and attractive. It's pretty easy to hit some of those without knowing the other person's preferences, but one obviously has an advantage if he knows the other's "type." Does he/she like a spunky personality? Does he/she prefer lascivious to demure, hunky or voluptuous to slender and frail? Is a "damsel in distress" going to trigger a positive or negative emotional response? It seems like knowing some of these things ahead of time would help the "I" player to make the lover more tempting to the hero, depending on how cool the other player was and how able he or she was to step outside of their box.<br/><br/>I was curious as to whether that assumption was correct. You seem to be saying that in previous plays you didn't think it mattered, but then you end with "It's hard to get the hero to stay, in my experience." This makes me wonder again if it would be easier to achieve that affect if you knew the hero's (player's) soft spots :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290343/#Comment_290343" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T08:22:54+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  8:22AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's more important to make the Lover an interesting, sympathetic, three-dimensional character then it is to hit the other player's romantic buttons -- so to speak.  You want to play towards the Hero more than the player.  In that way, regardless of whether the Hero rejects or accepts the Lover, the story will make sense and have meaning.  In the same way, the Hero player should play the Hero not as a personal extension of his own romantic proclivities, but rather as a fully-realized fictional character.<br/><br/>In other words, don't force it.  Just play the characters as characters.

I was talking to the other player by email earlier and wrote: "I don't think it's (just) about sex or love as much as it is about having something in the story that you are really drawn to and want to save or revel in.

There's two reasons I didn't feel like using the suggested character and settings taglines:<br/>1 - They didn't inspire me. I can imagine they're useful to other gamers though, either because of a "constraints drive creativity" angle or because they help to fight blank page anxiety. <br/>2 - Pride. As a gamer who has run/played games since the 80s, using these primers felt like cheating. It would have felt like I wasn't creative enough to come with my own idea of a premise. But even in my choice to come up with my own taglines the pre-generated ones were useful as examples of the scope, concision and openness required. <br/><br/>I'm enjoying our game a lot.
