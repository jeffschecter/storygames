You can still win a battle if you roll low values.  Here's what happened:<br/>\n<br/>\nI rolled a bunch of low values and Shirley rolled several high ones.  Shirley came out of the shoot with a 14 on two dice (force and fortitude) and I had to use 4 dice to defend.  This meant that my dice got damaged, but I used a finesse, two force, and a fortitude.  All of my dice got battered (rather than devastated).  I used the finesse to counteract her force die and my two force dice to take out her remaining available dice (it was just one component vs one component).  At that point we got interrupted, but had we not, I would have used a "healing" (analogous to a Vow in BRS) next to reclaim the battered dice, since it would have been my chance to attack (since I was out of dice anyway).  Shirley probably would have used one as well, but she only had 2 dice left.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought this was an interesting exchange, because even though I had a bunch of low numbers, the damage step gave me "another chance" and I came out a lot better than I could have, since I rolled all battered dice instead of devastated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBill                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266536/#Comment_266536" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T07:52:44+00:00" title="April 11, 2010  7:52AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those not familiar with BRS, it uses the Dogs in the Vineyard system of advancing pairs of dice out of a rolled pool to attack and matching the number advanced to defend with the number of dice needed being how successful the defense is.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of additions I made was that defeated dice don't generate "Fallout" they are either battered (lost for this conflict) or devestated (lost forever) based on rerolling them and checking for odds/evens (i did a brief flirtation with just using the existing odds or evens result to determine battered / devastated, but this proved to overwhelm all other decisions and made the exchange quite boring).<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, each die now has a color which represents is special power when advanced.  These do things like:  reach back in to your opponents pool and damage dice he hasn't used yet, protect your dice from damage, and other tricks.  One thing I really like about that is it puts an entire additional layer of tactical thinking on the Dog's conflict.  Since devastating dice is also the way you earn points to wn the game, pyrrhic victories become possible, where you "win" the conflict by running your opponent out of dice and get the fictional result, but suffer alot of devastated dice in the process which damages future effectiveness and score beau coup points for your opponent.  There's alot going on in these conflicts.  Having the right match up of dice powers, the right characters positioned in the fiction to participate, which of your opponents is also in a position to participate and whether they're likely to join your side or the enemy. Whether to advance a big pair of high numbers or save the special powers on those dice for the defense.  It can really be a fascinating interplay, especially because the choices you are making are also about setting up advantageous matchups in the future as well as inflicting damage and winning in the present.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat intricacy has a double edge, however.  By turning conflicts into an exciting mini-game all its own, it can mean a significant amount of down time for those not involved in that particular conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yes, the powers on the dice means that simply rolling big numbers doesn't guarentee victory...or at least doesn't guarentee a bloodless victory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266550/#Comment_266550" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T10:27:32+00:00" title="April 11, 2010 10:27AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if a standard RPG-style initiative system would work with this for The Philosopher's Stone.  Each player could get two initiative values, one for their character components and one for their story components, then go in initiative order and doing "half" a BRS exchange for each participant.  Reinforcements could happen at the end of a round, after everyone has gone.  This might divvy up the action enough to keep everyone involved and also make it more familiar to RPGers.<br>\n<br>\nSounds like I better just get DitV, now.  I've been putting it off for too many years.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266612/#Comment_266612" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T07:42:35+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  7:42AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that would be necessary for your variant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn BRS there are sometimes conflicts in which everybody participates and sometimes it is advantageous to maneuver in order to fight your enemies seperately.  So there are some conflicts where some players aren't even present.  I've made this a bit more difficult to do in the latest versions, so it usually the case that if someone really wants to participate they can, so if they're sitting out its largely because they want to.  Not perfect, but much better than it was, and I think fine for a competitive game where players are expected to assert their privilege rather than have it given to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in your Philosopher's Stone variant, you're creating more of a party dynamic, so typically every player is going to be participating in every conflict anyway.  Doing the full exchange wasn't a problem, time / committment wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to fiddle with the side based resolution, however.  Currently there are only ever 2 sides in the Clash and each side has a leader and that leader gets to decide who gets to attack for their side in that exchange (though the attacking player gets to choose their target).  With party based play you may want to have a fun way of deciding who gets to be the "party leader" and set up a dynamic for challenging that leader's leadership...rather than just let the Chronicler be the leader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266832/#Comment_266832" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T02:02:43+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  2:02AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I added that to the doc.  Actually, that added a new step for each act: "Narrator chooses conventions", which is like Universalis gimmicks and it makes the position of initial Narrator all that more tasty, I think.  At this point, I'm leaving it up to the Narrator to choose whether combat is 2-sided or N-sided.  If he chooses N-sided, he also chooses the initiative method (I have 3 methods to choose from so far).  For N-sided conflicts, I don't know whether it's a good idea to allow players to use both story components and character components, or make them choose one or the other.  For now, I'm saying they have to choose, because I think that can create a nice dilemma for a player.  Either way, they have two battle mats, one for story components and one for character components (or two colors for their dice, if that's manageable).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
