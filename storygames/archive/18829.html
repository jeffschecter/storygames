This is with different groups. I'm thinking the issue might be me!<br/><br/>In our games, we have pretty vivid show creation. Scenes vary between introspective scenes with little interaction between characters (others aren't present) to a few of them together, interaction a-plenty. But every time we go to do conflict, it feels unnatural. Like, we can just not do it and the scene is the same. Because of this, there's little incentive for Fan Mail. I mean, we're doing it unofficially: "that's awesome!" - "that was really funny!" - "I'd really like to see the next episode of this," - but we're not doing it mechanically, because we don't have a reason to.<br/><br/>And this keeps happening! We do one or two conflicts, and we just abandon it because it feels like it's getting in the way. It's a solid system, but it feels like it's restricting us making our show. Everyone I've played with has agreed - different groups, different years.<br/><br/>In fact, this most recent game (just this night) people were saying we didn't even need the Producer in an official capacity. I was the Producer, but I could've just been a player. Mechanically, it could work: the Producer can go from 1 to 6 cards, budget wise, and so you could just roll a d6 to decide how many cards go down. If it's more likely the budget would be big, roll two dice and pick the highest. But we don't, so really it's just us doing scenes one at a time.<br/><br/>Has anyone else felt this way? What could we be doing differently - I wouldn't say "wrong" - that's encouraging this kind of play? I don't think anyone has a problem with the rules, we just fail to engage them when they've shown up.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421752/#Comment_421752" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-21T23:55:26+00:00" title="September 21, 2013 11:55PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do feel like it's totally changing gears to switch from talking story to whipping out cards and spending points, but without that, I'd have missed some of my favorite plot twists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421753/#Comment_421753" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-22T00:44:46+00:00" title="September 22, 2013 12:44AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What happens when there's conflict in your show?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots" title="amazingrobots"><img alt="amazingrobots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amazingrobots">amazingrobots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421761/#Comment_421761" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-22T11:15:28+00:00" title="September 22, 2013 11:15AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We just narrate it out.

I'll never forget what Damon Knight said during an interview about the novel he'd just published.  He was talking about how every detail of the book was rigorous extrapolation of current trends and technology, and someone asked him, "Hey, what about the sea monster?  Where did that come from?"  Without missing a beat, Damon said, "Oh, I consulted an oracle."  <br/><br/>So that's why I think the randomizer is cool -- it puts in the sea monsters and unexplicable events that you wouldn't have come up with, like the fact that your teen superhero's love interest already figured out that she's a costumed crimefighter and is totally unimpressed.  See, I never would have thought of that, but losing that round of the card game sent the character in a whole new and more interesting direction. <br/><br/>But I don't want to be <i>that guy</i> and say you're doing it wrong.

There are things about the mechanics that just didn't work for the majority of us, and it dragged the whole experience down.<br/><br/>For example, one of the shows we pitched was in an action/adventure genre, and man, the mechanics just seem to suck the life out of action scenes. There's no space for the give-and-take of a traditional RPG chase scene or fight scene, and honestly, someone narrating how a chase worked out is a billion times less engaging than two or more people actually interacting with each other, making moves and counter-moves and all that stuff.<br/><br/>Eventually we got to the point you guys did: we did everything we could to avoid using the cards, because for us the fun part was interacting with each other in-character, and the mechanics always dragged us away from that right when things got interesting. (At the time I found it frustrating...but now, years later, I figure that's just how the game is, and there's nothing wrong with that -- it's just not well-suited to what our group enjoys most about gaming.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421776/#Comment_421776" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-22T22:02:33+00:00" title="September 22, 2013 10:02PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is how I'd play PTA if I ever got a chance to run it. I removed the conflict system from Psychodrame and it ran more smoothly and better in freeform (personal opinion). With PTA, the fanmail has been a major obstacle for me to run the game. Like Rickard and many other Swedes, I find fanmail to be like whipping out your wallet after sex ("That was great, here's fifty bucks!"), and I'd want to hack it out of the game if I was to play it.<br/><br/>So in my book, you're playing it right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mneme" title="mneme"><img alt="mneme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mneme">mneme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421779/#Comment_421779" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-22T23:44:11+00:00" title="September 22, 2013 11:44PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't play PTA often, and I'm not about to say that anyone's doing it wrong unless it isn't working.  And conflicts by-the-book in PTA are tricky; they take a lot of mindbending to get right and the result may not be what you want.<br/><br/>But I love fan-mail.  It's not like pulling out your wallet after sex -- it's that moment in sex where you go "that's great!  keep doing that!  Oh, yeah!"  The whole point is to mark good play at the time it happens; to go "yes, that!" without being as obtrusive.  This is why people used to fan-mail will often make the "fan-mail" gesture even if there isn't any fan mail to give.<br/><br/>Re PTA conflicts, one way I think might work to soften the gear-changing is to treat the "narrator" as the GM for the post-conflict resolution.  You don't have to stop roleplaying after the conflict even if you play by the book, but by mechanically passing around that section of the "GM" duties it lets everyone flavor resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421780/#Comment_421780" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T02:02:19+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  2:02AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2013 2:07AM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will just make this one post.\n<blockquote>But I love fan-mail.

It's like being on a dog show and be judged. "Now you were a good puppy. Here's some candy". If I'm awesome, tell me that verbally. Or even better: build on my ideas. If you like what I'm creating, then make sure the game is about that.<br/><br/>I just hate dog candy. It ruins my fun when I get that. Probably because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect#Controversy" rel="nofollow">overjustification effect</a>, where it states that rewards like dog candy mechanism only works if a) the task is boring in itself, b) you're competing against the others, or c) it's a verbal praise. Fan mail can (can, not will) also create a tendency to make the players make up things that they think <i>others </i>will enjoy, instead of what they are thinking are fun themselves. I can see the purpose of the mechanic - to make people praise each other - but it's just bad implementation based on how traditional rewards work (in a misused way) in roleplaying games. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/390786#Comment_390786" rel="nofollow">I've been</a> talking <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/397528#Comment_397528" rel="nofollow">about rewards</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/420831#Comment_420831" rel="nofollow">reinforcements before</a>.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>To the OP.

It is an interesting game to discuss because, unlike a lot of games in a similar space, it doesn't really work outside an episodic, multi-session format. I've never had a successful one-shot of PTA, but the five- and six-session seasons I've been a part of have routinely ranked among the best roleplayng experiences I've ever had. And that's over six or so seasons, in various groups, with various themes. <br/><br/>I hate to be the "prove to me you understand this game before we discuss it" guy, but I guess in this case I'm that guy. I get the feeling that those of you who have commented have either only read PTA or played it in one-shot mode, please prove me wrong. Suggesting that fanmail is a "dance, monkey, dance" mechanic like the bonus die in Sorcerer, for example, that's so wrong I don't even know where to begin.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421783/#Comment_421783" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T05:28:40+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  5:28AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I freely admit I haven't played PTA, so my fears may be unfounded, of course. I have played other games with fanmail-like mechanics (give the player a mechanically significant reward when she does something you think is awesome) and disliked it, but there might be something different about PTA that makes this not apply. Maybe the mechanical effect of fanmail isn't significant enough to trigger the overjustification effect, for example. <br/><br/>My point is that there's nothing wrong with not using a part of the system that doesn't work for you. I've done it myself and if I were to play PTA, I'd be tempted to play it the same way the OP does, though I might be willing to give it a shot as written, depending on how much time I have.<br/><br/>Anywhay, I'd love to be informed on how fanmail works better than similar mechanics (not sure how the bonus dice in Sorcerer works).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421793/#Comment_421793" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T08:21:10+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  8:21AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For starters the game, as written, won't work without fanmail flowing. If you "take it out" you've taken out the currency that allows the game to continue. At that point you are sitting around a table telling each other a story, which is a fine thing to do but has no relation to PTA.<br/><br/>Simon, you're right that the mechanical impact of fanmail is pretty minor in resolution, but the ecosystem it forms half of is the engine that drives play. It is explicitly non-diagetic, which is super interesting, because it is the only component of the game's design that really is (you can play PTA from a deeply metagame perspective, and people do, but you don't have to and I never have). <br/><br/>So you have to give and receive fanmail if you are enjoying the game and want it to continue. If you don't share it, the game stops, which is a graceful interface between rules and social contract. When that happens it's time to go do something else, and it is a nice reminder. <br/><br/>How and when you give fanmail is something each group hashes out on the social level, so it is possible to do it in a stupid, ugly way I suppose. When you play with people you trust and respect what seems to happen is that fanmail becomes a metatechnique for apportioning not spotlight but attention - it ends up getting shared more or less equally, and if someone hasn't caught any recently that is a flag for the whole table to put the deserving character in situations where they are likely to. And since it is the entire table's responsibility (and the Producer is locked out of that currency), it is sort of a carrier wave constantly reminding everyone to actively listen and care about each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421801/#Comment_421801" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T09:01:14+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  9:01AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2013 1:45AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I hate to be the "prove to me you understand this game before we discuss it" guy, but I guess in this case I'm that guy.

The Producer had run PTA before at conventions with positive results, so I'm not inclined to think that he was doing it wrong or that he was bad at it...it's more likely that the game wasn't fun because it simply couldn't handle the kind of show/game we liked and wanted to do with it. (But there was only ever one copy of the rules at the table and it was never in anyone else's hands, so I can't be 100% sure of that, I guess.)<br/><br/>FWIW, I don't think anyone in our group had any particular beef with fan mail. As an economy, it mostly seemed to work okay: it's not that we weren't having fun because there weren't enough tokens moving around to keep the game going, it was more that we weren't having fun because the way PTA handles and resolves conflicts wasn't fun. People weren't avoiding engaging with the mechanics because of fan-mail-related reasons, they were avoiding them because they just didn't like them.

Basically, extrinsic rewards undermine intrinsic rewards. However, this only applies to economical, and not social, rewards. This is why I think it might be important how mechanically "desirable" the fanmail is. If it's mostly symbolical and not very important, it becomes a social reward and all is fine. If it's something obviously valuable that buys you important things like screen time or success in the game, then the overjustification effect is likely to kick in. Not having played PTA, I'm prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt and I'm sorry if I criticized it unjustly.<br/><br/>I have the same beef with keys, by the way. My one session with a game that had keys (not TSOY or SS) felt hollow because the XP reward took the fun out of doing awesome things with my character. Again, it might have been the implementation in that specific game, or badly written keys or something, but I have no doubt it's a real effect. I'm prepared to accept that it's not an issue with how many people play PTA, however, because of mechanical, social or even cultural reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421810/#Comment_421810" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T11:13:38+00:00" title="September 23, 2013 11:13AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon I didn't feel like you were needlessly critical, but that you were arguing from a position that wasn't informed by play.

[I want you to have to fight for it in like a cool action scene or something] so there's three guards rushing out at you."<br/><br/>We usually back-and-forth until there appears to be a clear winner, at which point we ensure people are satisfied with what happened, and bring the conflict to a close. It's funny you mention why not just write a TV script - I think part of the fun with the groups we've played with has been that people were wanting to go into this thing doing just that. People enjoyed playing with the tropes of the format: commercial breaks, camera shots, Producer's budget as literal budget, so when you spend a lot, there's special effects and all. We haven't really seen it as a game, I don't think. More so as just a structure to create a fictional TV show.<br/><br/>But as above, though, that doesn't mean conflict is tidy. There's give and take. It's just a weird way of playing that only seems to come out during PTA. We haven't done this with Dogs, or Apocalypse World, nor My Life with Master, or shock. Only PTA, which I find strange.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421834/#Comment_421834" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T21:08:00+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  9:08PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Like, if fanmail is going around the table for injokes and pop culture references (which is fine, there's plenty of sitcoms that live on that) and you're actually trying to get some kind of wry observational joke across, even if the joke lands for you and for the Producer, if the other people at the table ain't yukking it up, you explicitly and fully and immediately understand that <i>no one cares</i> when you don't get any fanmail for it and the guy who quotes Monty Python in the scene does.

My greatest frustrations with  PTA  are 1) the difficulty of finding people to play it with and 2) the difficulty of finding people who share my aesthetics.  When both things happen, it's amazing though.  <br/><br/>For those folks who don't use the conflict rules: how does the Producer do their thing? Part of the fun of PTA for me is watching the players, and the Producer, push on the sore spots and Issues of each other's characters.  If you don't use the mechanics, you don't have any mechanical weight to push against the players with.  <br/><br/>By the way, this thread is really making me jones for a game of PTA.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421836/#Comment_421836" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T21:58:21+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  9:58PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Wait...when you say "what everyone wants" you're talking about the players?<br/><br/>Isn't there ever a time when the Producer wants the other players to actually back up what they "want" with some kind of investment or risk?

"What I want" when playing a game is sometimes that my character wins, sometimes that she loses and sometimes (often) both outcomes are great and interesting. Risking not getting what I want in the cases where one outcome is preferable to another can be off-putting (but doesn't have to. Depends on game and play style). The point of playing a game with many participants is the unexpected creative contributions from the other participants that makes the story take unexpected twists and go places you didn't expect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421837/#Comment_421837" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T22:10:38+00:00" title="September 23, 2013 10:10PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2013 10:13PM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd love to figure out exactly what it is that repels you about this sort of reward mechanic - I share your feelings in some ways, and certain games absolutely turn me off because of it.

In Sweden we call this "poodle show" (pudelutst\xe4llning) or "poodle points" (pudelpo\xe4ng). You put the poodle on display and the judges look at it and decide whether or not it's a good poodle. Anyway, the phenomenon I was talking about is something different, more subtle. Did you look at Rickard's Wikipedia link for the overjustification effect?\n<blockquote>two meta-analyses found that, for high-interest tasks, intrinsic motivation is diminished by expected, tangible rewards in both children and adults, especially when the reward is given for simply performing a task, regardless of the results. Nontangible rewards, such as verbal praise, and unexpected rewards do not undermine intrinsic motivation. In fact, praise may actually increase intrinsic motivation, as long as the praise is interpreted as sincere and a valid signal about the actor's competence.</blockquote>\nSo the important thing here is whether the reward is seen as "tangible" or "praise". If fanmail is percieved as a thumbs up, it can increase motivation. If it's seen as a reward, a resource that you need and want, it risks having the opposite effect. Interestingly, the effect here is stronger when it's given "regardless of the results", like with keys, and weaker when linked to performing well, like with fanmail.<br/><br/>EDIT: Note, though, that if the player thinks fanmail is given just for trying, even if her contributions aren't as great as the others, the praise is no longer percieved as "sincere and a valid signal about the actor's competence", which will not have the effect of increasing intrinsic motivation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin" title="Colin"><img alt="Colin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin">Colin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421845/#Comment_421845" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T04:56:59+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  4:56AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2013 4:56AM by Colin.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>We do try to get through conflicts as quickly as possible, as we also find that they sometimes disrupt the flow of the game, but I think that bringing in elements that one might not choose for themselves makes them very important.</blockquote>\nIsn't that what the other players are for?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely!

I can't assume I know exactly how the OP is playing, but with many consensus-based play styles, you rarely say "What about this instead?". Rather, you go with the flow and build on each others contributions and only if someone says something you really don't like you go "Uh, that doesn't sound right to me," or something similar. You often go many sessions without anyone saying it once, if the group has a good vibe. Someone goes "And the guy beats you silly with a stick" and I go "Ok, cool!" and we keep playing. We don't need to have a long discussion about what should happen because I find the suggested outcome to be interesting and it doesn't ruin my fun. I played a game a week ago where conflict is "What you say happens, unless someone objects" and there were all sorts of conflicts in game and nobody objected.<br/><br/>It's not like unexpected things only ever happen in dice rolling conflicts in "normal" RPGs.

While we can argue about the semantics of whether that qualifies as a "game", it's quite different from sitting down and collaborating on a screenplay. There's distributed narrative authority, chronological play, no planning ahead or editing past passages, etc. It can be fun and functional.<br/><br/>The question about PTA (or any game product, really), thus becomes: What does it add to your fully fun and functional play? <br/><br/>If collaboratively deciding the outcome works for you and drawing cards doesn't add any value, then this particular group doing this activity wouldn't benefit from using those rules. And that's cool. But there might be benefits you haven't seen or considered.<br/><br/>So! I think the most useful direction for this kind of conversation is to examine the potential benefits your particular group could get from these rules. I'm going to list a couple, and I'm sure others have their experiences to share as well (some of which are up there, just not formulated this way).<br/><br/>Disclaiming decision-making: when I run freeform games, I sometimes come across a situation where I'd rather disclaim the decision of a conflict to dice or cards. AP example: ancient Egypt heroes run out into a swarm of locusts to save a priest. Are they getting hurt? How much? Each equally (which would be fair but feel off)? Let's draw cards to spare me from agonizing over this decision and move on quickly.<br/><br/>Exiting the comfort zone: when we control the characters' fate, it's easy to be nice to them. Or harsh, depending on what you want. Use the cards to allow the possibility of something unwelcome to occur.<br/><br/>Audience experience: one of the things setting RPGs apart from other creative endeavors is that the creators are also the primary audience. Let yourself be surprised, the story taken in unexpected directions, by letting the cards decide branching.<br/><br/>Pacing: in PTA specifically, the budget provides a mechanism. By using cards and fan mail and the director's budget, everyone can feel which act of the show you're in and when it's time to start wrapping things up.<br/><br/>Again, this is not exhaustive and these might not appeal to you. But this way you can think about whether or not using the conflict rules makes sense for your group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421860/#Comment_421860" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T09:40:46+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  9:40AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2013 9:41AM by WarriorMonk.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I mean, we're doing it unofficially: "that's awesome!" - "that was really funny!" - "I'd really like to see the next episode of this," - but we're not doing it mechanically, because we don't have a reason to.<br/></blockquote>\nFor me it looks like you're <i>roleplaying</i> fan mail, instead of using the game mechanics to representate it.

Some are easier to acquire in freeform play than others. For example, I've used a system where you simply roll a die and let that guide your decision (higher roll is better for your character), without any mechanical attachments. This gets you a "disclaiming decision" boon without slowing the game down or risking unwelcome outcomes.<br/><br/>I agree with your points and I'm going to list a few drawbacks. This is not because I don't like conflict mechanics. I do like them and we use them in many games I play. And sometimes we don't, and that's cool, too. It depends on a lot of things.<br/><br/>Bogging down the game: This is the obvious drawback. Going to conflict, drawing cards or rolling dice, setting stakes and calculating results can stop the flow of the game, especially in you're in a flowing, fast-paced and action-y scene or a dialog.<br/><br/>Unwelcome outcomes: Sometimes a great story arch can end with a conflict and it goes the wrong way and it undermines the theme of the story arch. Sometimes a different, equally exciting theme is born and the surprise twist is awesome, but sometimes it can feel a bit hollow and "wrong" for that conflict to end that way.<br/><br/>Over-reliance on conflicts: Always having the conflict system there can make you gun for a conflict in every scene (and sometimes the rules specify that you <i>should</i> have a conflict in every scene), and you lose a lot of great scenes that are all about establishing things, about setting mood, about discoveries or decisions, or you have those scenes anyway and then force a conflict into them and it falls a bit flat. Some stories or styles of game do well with lots of conflict, some do better with less. Note that I'm talking about mechanical conflict here, not dramatic conflict. There's a way of looking at drama that frames every scene as a conflict of some kind, but that's not what I'm talking about here.<br/><br/>And because I fear being misunderstood: I love games with mechanical conflicts and I play them. I agree with Christan's points. I like both play styles and sometimes I like the one and other times the other. I don't know which way I'd go with PTA, because I haven't played it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421873/#Comment_421873" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T12:17:56+00:00" title="September 24, 2013 12:17PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2013 12:20PM by Alex F.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This overjustification effect is being used as a point of authority here, so I thought it would be useful to take a moment to think about this. I personally suspect that the effect is being overextended here, thanks to different uses of the term 'reward'.<br/><br/>In common parlance, game reward mechanisms are things that exist within the game system*. XP helps you level up which provides you with fun toys to play with. It's rare that you talk about a game reward system that asks you to collect $10 off each player (although now I've mentioned it, someone will design a game about it).  Fan mail is a game reward mechanism that affects the system, and so we might think it's the same kind of reward that psychology research talks about.<br/><br/>But I don't think that's true. Psychology typically refers to a reward to mean something of extrinsic value that follows an event: in operant conditioning, where the word got sharpened for purpose: peck the button, get the birdseed. Birdseed isn't an extension of buttoning, it's just a good thing that follows an event.<br/><br/>It's my understanding that all the research into overjustification follows this meaning of reward.<br/><br/>* solve puzzles, get money<br/>* build a model volcano, get a badge<br/><br/>Even the counter-findings mentioned are examples of rewards that follow the event and sit outside of it. Solve a puzzle, get praise.<br/><br/>I'm not aware of any instances of the OJ effect where the 'reward' is a component that extends or changes the original task/activity. <br/><br/>* solve puzzles, given trickier puzzles to solve?<br/>* build a model volcano, get given fizzy lava to put into your volcano?<br/><br/>And with it laid out like that, I'd be personally very surprised to hear that kids are less likely to make model volcanoes if they are promised cool fizzy lava to put into it. <br/><br/>Maybe fan mail isn't quite fizzy lava. But it's more fizzy lava than a valid gift certificate. So I'm not sure that overjustification tells us very much.<br/><br/>*I know, the Forge definition is a bit more complex. Not sure it's pertinent, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421881/#Comment_421881" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T13:20:27+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  1:20PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When playing Fiasco, I usually handwave at least one roll during the Set-Up.

(I acknowledge that this is a limit on my knowledge, but I think it is sufficient to comment on the game.) \n<blockquote>(re: the overjustification effect)<br/><br/>So the important thing here is whether the reward is seen as "tangible" or "praise". If fanmail is percieved as a thumbs up, it can increase motivation. If it's seen as a reward, a resource that you need and want, it risks having the opposite effect. Interestingly, the effect here is stronger when it's given "regardless of the results", like with keys, and weaker when linked to performing well, like with fanmail.<br/><br/>EDIT: Note, though, that if the player thinks fanmail is given just for trying, even if her contributions aren't as great as the others, the praise is no longer percieved as "sincere and a valid signal about the actor's competence", which will not have the effect of increasing intrinsic motivation.</blockquote>\nI know about the overjustification effect from my education studies and experience. However, note that this is an average effect - not an absolute. Many people may not be motivated by even sincere verbal praise, depending on the situation. People are not simple machines. \n<blockquote>I'm not aware of any instances of the OJ effect where the 'reward' is a component that extends or changes the original task/activity. <br/><br/>* solve puzzles, given trickier puzzles to solve?<br/>* build a model volcano, get given fizzy lava to put into your volcano?<br/><br/>And with it laid out like that, I'd be personally very surprised to hear that kids are less likely to make model volcanoes if they are promised cool fizzy lava to put into it.</blockquote>\nI don't offhand know of the original studies, but I do know that as I learned it, "tangible" applies to more than money. For example, in education studies, we considered gold stars were a form of tangible reward even though the gold stars have no external use. The motivation effects have to do with subconscious association - not logical reward. The importance of the tangibility is that it is visible and concrete, not their practical importance. As I learned it, poker chips are still tangible regardless of whether they can be traded in for real money. <br/><br/>As a teacher, I would not be surprised at all to find that many kids are less likely to make model volcanoes if they are promised cool fizzy lava to put in it. This is especially so if I have a bottle of the fizzy lava on my desk and tell kids that they can only get it if they make their model. The tangible reward of the lava is a distraction from their intrinsic interest in the task of the volcano model. As much as possible, I feel the core of teaching is bringing out what is interesting about the actual material rather than creating external rewards. <br/><br/>However, this is not an absolute rule for either schoolkids or RPG players.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421890/#Comment_421890" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T20:10:46+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  8:10PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2013 8:11PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I played freeform for many years (and still do).

If I reward making stuff with cash, then I'm doing stuff for cash (instrumental). But if I'm making stuff for the opportunity to make more stuff, then the original activity is still framed as valuable - because the pay-off <b>is</b> the activity.<br/><br/>Of course, there is always a risk. Fizzy Lava could certainly instrumentalise volcano-making if it is portrayed as the cool activity you are trying to win, rather than a cherry on the cake to make your awesome volcano even more awesome. But this is also true of verbal praise, or non-verbal feedback: there is some non-zero risk that someone will think 'you know, the only reason I'm using this silly voice is because everyone seems to like me when I do it'. <br/><br/>So I think it's fine to point to the overjustification effect as a point in principle, but less so to point to metanalyses and argue that this provides evidence that we shouldn't have reward principles. I just don't think the science extends that far: all the significant effects I know of all involve rewards that sit outside the activity, therefore instrumentalising the activity. Fan Mail, unless it buys you benefits outside the activity, shouldn't be considered under the scientific demonstration of the overjustification effect, even though sometimes, for some people, they will find it instrumentalising (because individual differences are huge, and people can react many ways to many things)<br/><br/>I could be wrong, which is why I asked for examples before. It's not exactly an idle question for me as I've taught this topic before and am involved in putting together course materials for university students that reference this finding, so I'm interested in understanding this properly.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421913/#Comment_421913" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T07:52:34+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  7:52AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>JDCorley, I feel you might be making a lot of assumptions about the play style that are not necessarily valid.

There is (or seems to be) no research that suggests there would be a difference between rewards within an activity and rewards external to it. You might be right, and you might be wrong. The research we have says that there's a difference between verbal praise and token rewards, and between unpredictable and expected rewards, but that's it.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that the person saying "the only reason I'm using this silly voice is because everyone seems to like me when I do it" wouldn't still be motivated. These effects are seldom conscious and logical. I think the effect is a consequence of misattribution. There is plenty of research showing that if you talk to a person and feel good, you will think that you like that person, even if the reason you feel good has nothing to do with that person. I think it's also related to confabulation, where a person will make up a reason for an action they undertook when they don't know the real reason (for example, because it was subliminal). It is clear to the observer that the reason was constructed after the fact, but the person still believes it.<br/><br/>I suspect the overjustification effect works much in the same way. I'm doing this thing, and when I'm doing it I get rewarded. Therefore I draw the conclusion that I'm doing it for the reward, not because I like it. If I'm doing the thing and I don't get rewarded for it, I must like doing it, because the only thing I get out of it is the activity itself. Compare with hazing, where I'm doing this thing (joining a fraternity) and I get punished and humiliated, but I still do it. Therefore I draw the conclusion that I must really want to get in. That's how hazing strengthens group loyalty.<br/><br/>This of course doesn't explain why it doesn't happen with verbal praise, but social interaction has so many other processes and effects going on that I suspect it's just interference from a different process.<br/><br/>(Oh, and I'm an engineer with no formal education in psychology.

I just don't think the science extends that far: all the significant effects I know of all involve rewards that sit outside the activity, therefore instrumentalising the activity. Fan Mail, unless it buys you benefits outside the activity, shouldn't be considered under the scientific demonstration of the overjustification effect, even though sometimes, for some people, they will find it instrumentalising (because individual differences are huge, and people can react many ways to many things)</blockquote>\nI would still quibble about what tangible means, but overall I agree with you that the science doesn't extend that far to really drive game design. However, conversely, there is a common idea from earlier behaviorist psychology that any desired behavior should be rewarded to motivate it. A lot of people have designed based on this principle. I don't think we should feel a need to put in a mechanical reward principle like Fan Mail for what we want. It's fine to try, but one should also try without it. My experience is that many games in practice get great results from behavior with no mechanical reward.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gordon" title="Gordon"><img alt="Gordon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gordon">Gordon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421937/#Comment_421937" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T11:48:23+00:00" title="September 25, 2013 11:48AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The research we have says that there's a difference between verbal praise and token rewards, and between unpredictable and expected rewards, but that's it.</blockquote> Simon - or anyone - how does the research distinguish between these pairs? In PTA, Fan Mail is (usually) both verbal praise ("well done!") and token ("have a chip"); both unpredictable ("will they be moved by this?") and expected (someone's going to get some eventually).  Verbal praise can happen without token reward, and various rewards (both unpredictable and expected) can happen in ways other than Fan Mail. <br/><br/>ASIDE: A few hours of research into this some months back having made me an expert (HA! hahahahahaHA!), I'd say trying to apply the far-from-conclusive results of overjustification research to RPGs is as likely to be inappropriate as it is to be useful. I mean, I love to see this stuff discussed, but any strong conclusion (even as strong as "PTA fan mail might have problems due to the overjustification effect") seems mostly unsupportable to me.<br/><br/>That said - I'd have to re-read PTA to see if there's text to support this filter, but in the (all-too few) times I've played, pure "doing it for the Fan Mail" behavior ... didn't get Fan Mail. It needed to spring compellingly from "what's going on in creating the show right now", or no reward. The overjustification effect <b>might</b> help explain why that's important, but I think its' importance stems from far more than just the overjustification effect.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421938/#Comment_421938" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T11:59:22+00:00" title="September 25, 2013 11:59AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points and I love how far this conversation is ranging into interesting corners of psychology. And Simon, gracious as you are to invite corrections, I think I've been nit-pick nerdy enough at this stage! I think you're on-point with what you've raised. Also conscious of being one of the people that hasn't played PTA beyond one- or two-shots think I'll probably bow out the conversation rather than derail. Especially as at this stage I think we're agreeing more than disagreeing.<br/><br/>John's point about a history of overextending other psychological principles is a great one, and the idea of trying games with and without mechanics I'm 100% in agreement with. Maybe with the caveat that if the game designer was thoughtful in designing the game, we may want to give them the due and try it 'their way' to see what emergent effects may fall out the back. <br/><br/>If interested, maybe at some point we can start a thread or conversation centred on mainstream psychology and its relation to game design. Nice beginnings here with competing effects like overjustification vs conditioning. There's also a interesting 'so what' conversation that we've already touched on: many psych effects are based on differences between groups (holding a hot drink group <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/science/july-dec08/warmth_10-24.html" rel="nofollow">feel warmer towards people</a> than holding a cold drink group) but within any group, reactions differ - some people won't experience the effect, or possibly even the opposite. What does this mean for how we generalise from research findings to practical points?

In collaboration there's no other kind of narrative authority than distributed, the fiction creation (whether play or collaboration) can't really be described as chronological if you're pre-planning out what happens as a result of character actions until you reach a consensus ("what if this happened" "no how about this" "only if you do this" "okay") and planning ahead does indeed happen for the same reason! (Planning ahead to a small degree even happens in normal PTA play with the character arc mechanic.)<br/><br/>I guess the lack of editing is one thing but couldn't you just agree not to edit what you made?<br/><br/>I'm not trying to be "the game police", I agree that doesn't get anywhere. But there is almost no PTA being used here so what does PTA actually bring to this group?  Just permission to do it?</blockquote>\nI'm starting to see where you're coming from: you play every game the same, just like you would write a screenplay. That explains your overall attitude about designers not having any control once the game is in the group's hands and so on. Okay.<br/><br/>See, I play these games differently. Even when our group is not using the conflict resolution, and we're roleplaying without cards/dice/whatnot, we have very different experiences. When we play PTA, we're guided by the overall setup of it as a TV show, screen presence, and issues. When we play Archipelago, we're guided by destiny points and each person's realm of authority (in our case, Dragons, Dreaming, etc.). When we play Ribbon Drive, we're guided by Futures and the specific song that's playing.<br/><br/>So for you it might all feel the same. But for us these games play very, very differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>We

don't think they're <i>that </i>blunt. Let's look at the PTA character sheet: <br/>Issue <br/>Screen Presence (which immediately makes people think in terms of story arc, in my experience)<br/>Edges<br/>Connections<br/>Personal Set<br/><br/>It's pretty stripped down and laser-focused on story material.  I know I'm biased as a PTA fan, but I always feel pumped to get my game on after making a character because I'm looking forward to using his "Connection: Ex-wife" or "Set: abandoned meth lab" at some point. It's a very similar feeling to what I get with Fiasco, but there's always a feeling of detachment with Fiasco because I know that my character is probably doomed and damned before the first scene. <br/><br/>I also think that we shouldn't dismiss the role of a specific game in providing a "permissive environment" for certain kinds of gaming behavior.  We see this all the time with story-games, right? When I play Monsterhearts, I'm giving myself and everyone else at the table permission to be emotional and dramatic and polymorphously adolescent.  When I play Dogs in the Vineyard, I know somebody's going to preach crazy backwoods homespun theology before they shoot somebody else; I'd be disappointed if it didn't happen. Polaris makes this permissive role of RPGs explicit by having a little ritual at the beginning and end of the session.  <br/><br/>So if a group plays PTA and at some point stops using the conflict rules, but the group still calls it playing PTA, I guess there's nothing wrong with it. They obviously value some things about that game, even if not all the mechanics work for them. If you look at it this way, this is actually an extremely common phenomenon in gaming -- lots of people have played Vampire: the Masquerade without rolling the dice, for example.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422068/#Comment_422068" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T00:16:40+00:00" title="September 27, 2013 12:16AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2013 12:19AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it!
