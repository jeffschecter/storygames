While I was playing out this scene however, the detention kids were secretly passing notes to each other. This exchange of notes ended up quite extensive (and hilarious, at least to us).<br/><br/>Overall, it was totally unexpected, showed great player initiative and worked brilliantly. And it sped up the whole narrative as we were effectively playing two scenes simultaneously.<br/><br/>It worked for me anyway!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406781/#Comment_406781" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-20T21:12:44+00:00" title="February 20, 2013  9:12PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!

Thanks for sharing this tidbit, James. <br/><br/>Oh wait, you can text! Of course! You just have to write it down and pass it back and forth. Please use the same sheet of paper and make sure to make little bubbles like on a smartphone. Shutting someone Down is easy. Sext to Turn Someone On. Share with the other players and GM after they are done with the current scene. <br/><br/>I don't think you need a mini-MC for texting. I think I agree with James' love for GM-less play. It's rough having to have all the information travel through the MC. I get bored sometimes during other peoples' scenes ('cause I'm a narcissist).<br/><br/>The main problem I see is loss of active listening, like Kira pointed out. I have a lot of trouble with this already, as my mind wanders and I start thinking about what I can do with what is happening. "Texting" might be a way for me to stay engaged. <br/><br/>Maybe I'd give myself a timer. After a scene has been going for five minutes, I can start "texting". I can pay careful attention while the other person is replying...<br/><br/>Plus... there is this feeling that I associate with being a teenager. It's, like, wherever you are, you feel, like, there is something more relevant, important, and exciting somewhere else. When you, like, listen to music on the radio, you can barely let the song end for fear of what you are missing, like, on another station. Maybe "texting" would help recreate this anxiety, like, in a fun way. <br/><br/>TL;DR: Notes could be texts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406829/#Comment_406829" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T11:21:06+00:00" title="February 21, 2013 11:21AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh awesome!

It is then easily shared with others. I feel like quickly jotting something down is faster than actual texting (for me at least).

While the MC is handling one scene the other players not involved might slip into a conversation off to the side which can, and does quite often develop into a whole nother scene. Usually we refrain from rolls due to the stakes and complications that could come about with a 6- or 7-9. But that's more so we do't have to interfere with what the MC is doing to ask him for adjudication of a roll. <br/><br/>It's a great way to pass the "downtime" when the spotlight isn't on you and wither doesn't pertain to you or you want the scenes contents to be as much a surprise to you as to your character.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406859/#Comment_406859" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T15:02:42+00:00" title="February 21, 2013  3:02PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Do you ever not make eye contact with the person you are texting and just speak to no one?
