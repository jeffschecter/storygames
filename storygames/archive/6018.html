Just saying.  Warn me next time.<br/><br/>The sledgehammer thing worked like this:<br/><br/><i>Unknown Armies</i> has a whole bunch of crazy schools of magic, and they get their juice from some kind of semi-ritualistic behavior.  Cliomancers get their charges by visiting sites of historical interest and harvesting them, which leads to some tasty little rivalries.  Newton Carter (PC) had a friendly rivalry over some juicy sites in New Orleans with Carmen Degadillo (NPC).  <br/><br/>Newton works for The New Inquisition, which is like the Foreign Legion of freaky shit: a crazy billionaire pays you to forget your past and fight the good fight (against his enemies.)  His cell have been tasked to chase down some artifact or other, and as they start to ask around, a well connected friend puts them in touch with a weird black guy - blind blues musician type.  Joe.<br/><br/>Anyhow, Joe tells them he can give them the whole run down on the ritual they'll need to find this artifact.  Otherwise, they're facing a bunch of tedious research; asking questions, making little deals, all of that.  But he's gotta know that they're committed.  "Pick someone you know, and bring me a Polaroid of them.  To get started."  He tells em.<br/><br/>They know that nothing good can happen to whoever it is, so the players start going down the list of NPCs, and they pretty quickly settle on Carmen.  If something untoward were to happen to her, they're thinking, Newton can take over her sites.  And they're kind of friendly, but not too.  So, they get lunch, and arrange for a picture to get taken that won't be suspicious.  They're already buying in here, you'll notice.  They know something bad will happen, and they don't want her to blame them.<br/><br/>They bring the Polaroid to Joe.  He looks at it.  "You sure?"  They're sure.  He puts it in an envelope, and leaves, promising to get back in touch.<br/><br/>They get a call: come to this house, in a slightly lower-rent part of town, 11, 11:30.  They show up, there's a white panel van parked outside.  Joe is there at the door.  He leads them back to the kitchen, where there's stairs down to the basement.  This is New Orleans, so the basement's actually above ground, mostly, but concrete and tile and stuff.  There's a couple of big burly guys, both of whom look more than willing to put the hurt on, and also a little afraid of Joe.  Joe tells the guys who came with Newton to wait, and the two guys and Joe and Newton go down to the basement.  Basement's all covered in plastic drop cloth and white sheeting.  It takes a minute to see that what looks like a easy chair with a dust cover is a person handcuffed to a chair, with a sheet over them.<br/><br/>They hand Newton a sledgehammer.  Joe says "Go ahead.  Or aren't you committed enough?"  Newton Carter, architect on the run from the mob, history buff, thinks meat comes from the grocery store, swings the sledgehammer into the face of the figure on the chair.  And just before the blow lands, he hears Carmen say, "Newton?"<br/><br/>Newton Carter came up those stairs a different man than when he went down.  <br/><br/>The fact that, through weird ritualistic stuff, Carmen's sister died instead, and Carmen proceeded to continue to collect from her sites, even interfere with and eventually try to kill Newton and his friends was just an irritation.  She'd done a whole lot more damage under the hammer than behind it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134704/#Comment_134704" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T15:40:05+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  3:40PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite><br/>How do you achieve that?

And every time it was another little step along the path.  I don't know if my players ever believed it, but they completely would have been able to get what they wanted another way - this was just easier.  And each step seemed small: agree to get a picture, take the picture, deliver the picture, "are you sure," come to the house, come downstairs, take the sledgehammer, thunk.  And each was built on the incredibly powerful force of not wanting to reverse ourselves, not to back down, not to look silly, not to have wasted effort.  Any time, Newton (his player, really) could have said "No, fuck no, you freaky blind blue singer thing."  That was very much the situation I wanted to build, honestly, was that garden path, but I think it was important that at least I knew that if Newton stepped off the path, there would still be a way to proceed.  The ritual was out there somewhere.  \n<blockquote>How could you tell that the players were terrified?</blockquote>\nUA has a really cool madness mechanic, which I like a lot for the most part.  As a specific case, killing a helpless opponent is called "pointblanking" and is always a Rank 7 (of 10) Violence check.  Newton's player demanded the check as soon as he was back to himself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134706/#Comment_134706" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T15:43:35+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  3:43PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and regarding the heist movie mass murder?  I still have no idea what happened.<br/><br/>I was talking to Christopher Kubasik about this incident, as a implicit "is this a Bang" question, and his thought was this:  I'd presented binary choices all the way down that path.  At every step was this little "do you do another little bad thing?" question, and that a Bang is a situation.  "Do what you have to" is the Bang.  And after a lot of set up, when I let that group off the leash, they went to town.  To be clear, I don't think any of them were every horrified about that situation, but I certainly was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135197/#Comment_135197" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T09:19:31+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  9:19AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judson, I don't know what to say other than "kick-ass".

For several reasons. Basically the player often has some vested interest (or is taught by tradition or system that he does) in keeping his character alive, and/or "winning" the situation. In such a case, he's not going to be working to create a horrific atmosphere, and often work precisely against that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it's absolutely essential, in my experience, to get the players on board with creating the horror. If it's not "The GM is trying to scare us" but instead "we are all trying to scare each other" then that's when you actually can get scary situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah, Judson's little steps are challenging the player to do the scary thing. Good technique. But, generally, any technique that you use that brings the player on as a collaborator, as opposed to a competitor, or investigator, is going to help create a creepy mood. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135669/#Comment_135669" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T09:12:33+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  9:12AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>generally, any technique that you use that brings the player on as a collaborator, as opposed to a competitor, or investigator, is going to help create a creepy mood.</blockquote>\nA little disconcerting since the design I'm working on has players <b>competing</b>, using plenty of <b>investigation</b>, and it's intended very specifically as a horror game.

There is actually no clear prize the players compete over, but the conclusion of a story is only possible when the inter-player conflict is resolved. I believe that the mechanic will drive the players to compete. The front-loading of certain conflicting motivations also play into this - see, perhaps, IaWA for an example.\n<blockquote>To see who discovers the truth first?</blockquote>\nDiscovering "the truth" about a character is a minor goal within the game, which could equate into an advantage into resolving the conflict in your favour. See, perhaps, Paranoia for an example. "The truth", by the way, is mostly defined by players themselves while playing and is not so much pre-determined by the game (as opposed to Paranoia, where it's both determined up-front and by the game mechanics.\n<blockquote>Are the players competing with each other? Or against the game?</blockquote>\nAgainst each other.\n<blockquote>And what is the arena of the competition? Tactics? How do we judge who is winning the competition?</blockquote>\nIn my example playtest scenario, the arena is a tribe of Saami at some unspecified point in history, approximately 150-200 years ago. The playing pieces are the minds of the tribe members. The struggle is between "old" and "new", specifically naturalistic beliefs versus monotheism. The characters are all leader-types in various ways, empowered and potentially capable of committing atrocities for their goals.\n<blockquote>In the game Pantheon, players compete to make the best myth. Which results in some good myths (other problems aside). In Call of Cthulhu, some players compete with the monsters. This creates, at best, a good tactical scenario. Not very scary.</blockquote>\nYet, I've been in some good and scary CoC games - but perhaps despite the premise rather than due to it. <br/><br/>I plan on reaching playtesting in the next couple of months (I'm slow). We'll see what happens.<br/><br/>Thanks for asking!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
