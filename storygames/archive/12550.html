In short:<br/>\n<i>Its about playing special people in a tech-rocking future dominated by a sprawling company that knows everything (maybe) and their butt-kicking drama as said company tries to pidgeon hole them into a set destiny. Pretty much you could add the subtitle: Where shit hits the fan. You have the option of playing an employee of Truth, Inc. - a citizen with an interest in Truth, Inc. - or a fugitive wanted by Truth, Inc. So the company is always at the center of things, at least at the start of play. The game runs on three tenets of play: <b>The characters are cool motherfuckers</b>, <b>its the goddamn future</b>, and <b>the question shits on everyone</b>.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOk, with that out of the way the interesting part of the playtest experience for me has been matters of trust. The game group I'm playing this with is my normal group and we also play a handful of rather traddy stuff like Exalted, Shadowrun 4th, and DnD 4E (various people GM and so on). My experiences with those games has been a bit different than Truth, Inc. in regards to trust. The trust is always there, I think it has to be in order to play a game with people. I'm talking about multiple levels here, like you trust in the system to do what it says and you know it can do as much as you trust a fellow player to treat you with respect or observe some part of the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe contrast here for me is while the trust is there (or not) in these other games it was always buried under whatever other issue propped up with a particular rule or part of the fiction under discussion. Playing Truth, Inc. its been much more in the open and the gaming has improved because of that. A big big part of Truth is the fact that the shit is going to hit the fan, and the Admin (GM) is going to totally screw the character over at some point. Its a part of the game, and in fact its how you earn reward levels which either lead to improvement or can be spent to refresh various character energizing pools.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just finished the 3rd playtest session up yesterday and now finally I can see the game coming together in a working way and it looks great. The players are aware their character is going to get screwed over and even embracing it, and they trust me as the Admin to make sure its going to be cool. I've even had a couple players decide that even though they could spend reward levels to save themselves from it, they were just going to run with it and see what shakes loose (also earning more reward levels in the process). We had so many laughs and enjoyment over the last session (and the earlier ones but not as prevalent) that I just can't wait to play again and I think this is obviously what we are all looking for in our games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I'm wondering a lot. Has anyone else has any similar experiences in their gaming? Does this make sense to anyone but me?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281956/#Comment_281956" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T16:01:43+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  4:01PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe.  I mean, I've definitely encountered this:\n<blockquote>The players are aware their character is going to get screwed over and even embracing it, and they trust me as the Admin to make sure its going to be cool.</blockquote>but it looks very different in different games.<br><br>What counts here as "cool"?  Is that a measure of colorful portrayal?  Of dramatic climax?  Of thematic depth?  Of pure "how <i>much</i> can I possibly screw with you?" glee?<br><br>Sometimes I trust in a process like this because I trust the person to make it cool.  Other times I trust in the process because it's part of what I bought into when I agreed to play the game.  If I heard a "you're gonna get screwed, and here's why that's fun" pitch, and opted to play, then trust becomes easy.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281983/#Comment_281983" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T18:08:38+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  6:08PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2010 6:10PM by JasonP.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, <b>right</b>.<br><br>This is exactly what I was talking about. You've got two types of trust going on, trust in the person and trust in the system to do what it promises (what you bought into). Obviously there is overlap, since the players are executing the rules of the game and realizing the system that way.<br><br>Whats cool? Oh man, I totally dropped one of those "this is so clear to me, but doesn't me crap to you" words here. My bad. So ok, talking about cool in this context. Here is what I think is cool, prioritized from most important to last:\n<ol>\n<li>The vocal players think its fun (can't help that the silent players don't express).</li>\n<li>The fiction itself has some engaging, interesting detail.</li>\n<li>The events open doors for more drama or thematic content.</li>\n</ol>\nSo this doesn't include the "screwed" angle at all, I'm thinking broader than that in my preferences/style. I'm not sure how much of this can be enforced by a system, though advice and direction can be given.<br><br>I guess I'm kind of saying here that certain games, certain styles of play, really bring the matter of trust right up front. My experiences with a lot of traditional games has been that the trust is slowly built up over time as the game wears on and things develop, and something more dramatic really pushes it right at the start.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281998/#Comment_281998" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T21:13:58+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  9:13PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!  Sorry, my design brain was distracting me from your real point here.  Yeah, I hear you on trust -- some games you might not ever have a moment where you realize how important it is, and other games, as soon as you start, it's like, "Oh crap, something that matters to me is in your hands!"  I bet that's partly a reaction to novelty (you kind of get over having your character's fate in the GM's hand in a very traditional game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282243/#Comment_282243" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T17:40:54+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  5:40PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I've always wondered about in games--where inherent lack of trust is generated in players who've experienced a game of Shadowrun. The players distrust Mr. Johnsons. Yet real people make the mistake of trusting people that belong in that station/position even if there is a chance--because of the great reward, but players knowing its just game currency don't feel as comfortable exerting that in play. Is there a way to make player currency work in the character realm? That is there trust or distrust expressed in play earns or directs their actions as they choose them? If that makes any sense in this context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282247/#Comment_282247" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T18:02:50+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  6:02PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, that is switching streams here (but never cross them!) since I was talking about trust at the table, between players and between players and the system itself. However, it does apply in this context too. I can totally see issues here with trust inside the fiction itself, since the Admin is out to mess with the player (not out to get them, as that doesn't work in this system). An obvious consequence of this will be issues with the player characters and players wondering who they can trust. I wonder how that will affect longterm play, I've only got three sessions under my belt at this point of playtest one so its still an unknown. It'll be something I'm thinking about in coming sessions though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
