The humans, led by General Mur-Ayya, were victorious but unbeknownst to them the last surviving demon, Shalatine, cursed them wander between the worlds, unable to go home yet returning to the battle site every 100 years. In time a glade of mighty oaks arose on the battle site.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last 100 years the ambient magic of the glade has found a personification, Awashalim. This guardian protects and *IS* the forest. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe wizard Mizra seeks demons to bind to his will and all the oracles indicate that tonight, in the Far Flung Glade, a great demon will arise. The game begins as the ghostly army marches into the glade while Mizra approaches secretly on foot...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sudden appearance of Mur-Ayya's army disturbs Awashalim who demands they leave. Mur-Ayya is indignant, believing they glade is more their's than anyone's... while they argue Mizra sends an imp-like demon to scout ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe presence of two supernatural forces beginning to boil above him pricks the senses of the interred Shalatine, but is the scent of human life essence that finally stirs him from his torpor. As Mizra's imp talks with Mur-Ayya's sentries Shalatine lashes out, sucking a bit of life from the wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile they debate Awashalim flexes his might and destroys one of Mur-Ayya's sentries. <br/>\n<br/>\nShalatine can await no more and bursts through the soil in the center of the glade! A pitched battle ensues, with Awashalim emerging (barely) as the victor. Shalatine realizes that he isn't as strong as he hoped and he begs for his life promising to leave Awashalim (and the glade) in peace. Has he flees he taunts the General and the wizard, promising them good hunting in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of Chapter 1.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
