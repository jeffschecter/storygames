Do you, instead, sometimes just have one of the characters chasing that Need? <br/><br/>How often does a Need, instead, applying to everyone (or nearly everyone) at the table?<br/><br/>In short, I'm curious how many characters are impacted by each of the Needs you author, and why you might choose to do it one way instead of the other way.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405559/#Comment_405559" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T06:27:06+00:00" title="February  6, 2013  6:27AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For example, let's say we're playing and we place "Need: to Get Laid... to find true love" between us.

The point is that the Need will motivate both characters connected to it in some way. When explaining it at the table I usually say something like "one character or the other has the need, or they both need it, or someone else (an NPC) that they both care about has the need. Whatever the case, it drives them both to action."<br/><br/>I would be careful about option D, assuming the Need applies to everyone at the table- initially it's only about the two characters touching that Need. However, the chain of relationships will soon make sure that everybody gets involved, one way or the other.<br/><br/>As far as how to choose, I usually base that on the definitions in the attached Relationship and the other Relationships touching those characters. What are the characters like, based on the Relationships on each side? How would they interact with that Need? After that, what seems off-balance, and most likely to cause some trouble in your story? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405561/#Comment_405561" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T06:55:06+00:00" title="February  6, 2013  6:55AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's whatever makes sense given the need and the two characters on either end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405567/#Comment_405567" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T08:24:56+00:00" title="February  6, 2013  8:24AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always stress that it has to be important to both of them, for whatever reason. Maybe A wants to get laid and B really, really wants to prevent that from happening, for example. Your option C is no good.<br/><br/>I think it's a good idea to "keep it in the family" wherever possible, so your first impulse should always be to find true love with another player's character, rather than some limp NPC. <br/><br/>I recommend two needs in a four player game. If they both touch the same character, the overall story will inevitably bend toward them. If you want a more ensemble feel, put the needs opposite one another.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405571/#Comment_405571" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T09:59:51+00:00" title="February  6, 2013  9:59AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve and Jason hit the nail on the head -- the Need needs to be important to both characters but it doesn't necessarily need to be identical for each of those characters.<br/><br/>When playing with new players and a Need comes out touching at least one of them, I usually try to throw out a half-dozen or so possible interpretations. For instance, let's say Amy and Bob have a relationship of "Romantic - Spouses" and the Need "To Get Revenge... for what happened last year" comes out between them. I might offer these possibilities:<br/>* Amy and Bob jointly want revenge against someone else (preferably another PC) <br/>* Amy wants revenge against Bob<br/>* Bob wants revenge against Amy<br/>* Amy wants revenge against Bob AND Bob wants revenge against Amy<br/>* Amy wants revenge against someone other than Bob (preferably another PC); her drive for revenge is having a significant (probably negative) impact on Bob<br/>* Bob wants revenge against someone other than Amy (preferably another PC); his drive for revenge is having a significant (probably negative) impact on Amy<br/><br/>I also tend to point out that the simplest interpretation is usually the best. In the above examples, I'd say that the first four are simpler interpretations than the last two, especially for new players.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405602/#Comment_405602" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T15:51:20+00:00" title="February  6, 2013  3:51PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great answers, thank you very much!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405754/#Comment_405754" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T12:24:02+00:00" title="February  8, 2013 12:24PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [As pointed out in the "What did you get wrong at first" thread: This generally also applies to Objects and Locations, too.
