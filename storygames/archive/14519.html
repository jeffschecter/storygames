The new one especially <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23shiftyeyes&amp;Mode=like">#shiftyeyes</a>. It offers what I think of as the best possible types of questions. <br/><br/>Can you? is a simple question that simple games ask. Can you jump across this gap? Can you pass a skill check? can you has the possibility for various results like pass, fail, twist.<br/><br/>what do you do? Games like mass effect offer these moments. What do you do, let the cyborgs live? or blow them up! This is destination based thinking games are about the build and journey. <br/><br/>Deus ex asks both "can" and "what" but more importantly and frequently it asks you how, as in "how do you do it"? To me "how" is a very interesting question. Everyday we are faced with how. How do you get the money to go to collage. Do you get a loan, scholarship, convince your grandparents to pay for it, work a second job?  When a game asks me how it opens up worlds of options and methods. It lets me express something more then an ideology, it lets me express a methodology. Characters are truly defined by both means and ends.<br/><br/>More importantly when you ask "how" you have already established a "What" you leave a player with some choice but not such an overwhelming choice as "what". An open ended "What" question can be a big struggle like "what do you want to eat" there are too many options. but if we answer that "what" with "pizza" the question is now "how" how do you get pizza? Delivery, carry out, homemade, frozen, dine in, buffet, these are all answers to how to get pizza.<br/><br/>I think "how" is what really separates table top experiences and most video games. I constantly hear "how" asked in role playing games. In fact I think how is the best possible input a player can have in an rpg.<br/><br/>So what do you think about all this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330714/#Comment_330714" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T06:49:43+00:00" title="June 19, 2011  6:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>So what do you think about all this?</blockquote>\nThat i should get to play Deus Ex.<br/><br/>apart from Joking, i really like your analysis. "how" is the thing that really sets the tabletop experience apart. I can choose different path, and i can derail from them if i wish to. in a computer rpg, the environment  and character's interactivity is bound. When you are creating a story (take it in the largest interpretation possible, including traditional tabletop rpg), the interactivity you enjoy is boundless. <br/>you can state "what" you want to do with a much larger scope than any computer game will ever allow you (sandbox-y games like morrowind always feel alien to me),  and you can freely state "how" you want to do it. the only limit is "can" you do it?<br/><br/>Another way of seeing this, which i think is complementar, is when and how you get to make decisions. In a Tabletop RPG, in every moment you can make meaningful decisions (not "which weapon will i use", but "against whom will i turn my weapon"?), bound only by the story you are creating and by the social contract at the table. In a Computer RPG, you usually get to make meaningful decisions only at predermined "plot nodes".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330739/#Comment_330739" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T13:54:04+00:00" title="June 19, 2011  1:54PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2011 1:55PM by TylerT.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Deus ex is great fun, while it is available on steam it is a little tricky to make work on modern pc's.

If you're interested I can tidy it up and post it.<br/><br/>Albi, one of the great things about the original Deus Ex was how the game allowed and responded to your making decisions at practically every moment of the game, it was not simply limited to 'plot nodes' as many turning points in the story were malleable. Interestingly, and refreshingly even today, the actions you were allowed to do by the narrative were never spelled out for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330764/#Comment_330764" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T18:26:49+00:00" title="June 19, 2011  6:26PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>Well, given a certain point of view, maybe not.

Though I think people forget how linear the original Deus ex was. The beta of this new one starts rather liner but once you hit the city hub it and the side missions are quite a bit more open compared to liberty island or battery park.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330786/#Comment_330786" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T22:58:21+00:00" title="June 19, 2011 10:58PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2011 11:00PM by Tulpa.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course the linearity was part of the original game, but I meant linearity in the sense that the game doesn't account for unexpected actions. The most common instance I've seen, and one that I came across myself (because I like testing the limits of a Deus Ex game) is thus: If you save the hostages in the first mission by disabling the bomb, you can then shoot them all in the head and the game will still treat the event like you saved everyone.<br/><br/>Compare this to something as innocuous as killing the bartender in Hell's Kitchen in the original Deus Ex having actual repercussions down the line. It's a difference of philosophies; Human Revolution tried to be a game that felt <i>like</i> Deus Ex while Deus Ex tried to be a game that let you act as you pleased and, this is the important part, the game would take note of what you have been doing, no matter how mundane.<br/><br/>No doubt, they both account for "how" a player does something, but I feel Human Revolution sabotaged itself right at the end. "How do you deal with a major antagonist?" was a question asked often in the original Deus Ex. Human Revolution sees fit to offer a single choice with "A locked room boss fight"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330790/#Comment_330790" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T23:19:52+00:00" title="June 19, 2011 11:19PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah the "awesome boss fight" was a little disappointing (dont forget Gunther train station), i wanted some vents to crawl around in that room maybe a terminal to hack to activate gas or turrets. <br/><br/>also, you killed the hostages? that's sick! hopefully they will add recognition for that (they are still working on the game).<br/><br/>i know the game recognized my non lethal methods.
