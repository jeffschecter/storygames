                    Is there a bit of game in prepositions like this?  <br/>Like it's holding onto something, until the end.  Like a joke.<br/><br/>If you don't know, and you might not, the discussion title is an often referenced Pennsylvania German English, what we call Pennsylvania Dutch, phrase.  <br/><br/>How good are games, like Joking Hazard, at telling jokes?<br/><br/>Thanks for reading, if you did.<br/> </div>

                            I don't really know what you're trying to get at, but as a linguist from Pennsylvania Dutch country who's second language (Japanese) loves long strings of dependent clauses before finally getting to the predicate, I'm rather intrigued.<br/><br/>I'm vaguely reminded of some rules attempts I've seen that reward players for "adding more information," encouraging long strings of descriptors for character actions that might honestly do better without. Or the way some rulesets pile on modifiers ad nauseum in order to make simple (and sometimes frequent) rolls.                        </div>

                            Oh, the description as possible resource thing that a bunch of games do, that can often feel like cheating, or backpedaling, and can sometimes be bit long-winded in play, but not always?     <br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>I'm much more interested in the dependent clauses before the predicate one.   <br/>It feels kinda like story structure.  There's a bit of misdirection going on.                          </div>

                            It's a garden-path sentence.  Like the classic "Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana." You think the word is saying something when you first read it, then you realize in the end that it was actually saying something else, and you have to go back and rethink the sentence.<br/><br/>This has obvious dramatic parallels. You think Mr. Johnson is giving you cash for doing a job for him, but then you realize he's actually setting you up as patsies for a crime. Or any of a bajillion Holywood movies. Once you find out a piece of information in the end, you need to go back and reinterpret a bunch of stuff to make sense of the new piece of information.<br/><br/>For gaminess, I guess there's a parallel to an ability/card/whatever having one effect, but then in the presence of a different ability/card/whatever, suddenly it does a different thing because of synergy. Your card allowing you to switch the order of the three top cards in your deck isn't very exciting in itself, but once you gain an ability that does damage based on the cost of the top card of your deck, that ability gets really powerful.<br/><br/>Other examples from Wikipedia:<br/>The horse raced past the barn fell.<br/>The old man the boat.<br/>The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.                        </div>

                            A twist in the end. As has been said elsewhere about mystery, these revelations are tailor made when they are in the hands of players during play, rather than engraved in mechanics or prepared in advance by one player. I don't find Joking hazard jokes funny, and I don't like the classic version of Dixit where there is one right answer. What always surprises me is how creative players are when they are given the chance.<br/> </div>
