I'm currently working on a Tengu Skin myself, though it's gone in a completely different direction than your's has, <a href="/forums/profile/Lula">@Lula</a>. I didn't focus on the trickster/class clown aspect, but more on the protector aspect.<br/><br/>Feedback:<br/><br/><b>Names, Looks, and Stats</b><br/>I like the name explanations, but none of the names really jump out at me. That's probably just personal taste though.<br/><br/>The looks are all great, though I don't get "sleepy eyes".<br/><br/>The origins are really nice.<br/><br/>The Stats make sense for the Joker-esque Tengu you've written up.<br/><br/>Moves:<br/><br/><b>The Aristocrats</b><br/>I like the idea here, but it looks like the move only works on a 10 up. Manipulate an NPC says "On a 10 up, they'll do what you want if you give then a bribe, a threat, or a motive." So that works, as the Tengu's sharp wit qualifies. But on a 7-9, the MC tells you what it'll take to get the NPC to comply. It doesn't look like the Tengu's sharp wit would do anything here. Maybe that's intentional, and you're Move only does something on a 10 up, but it's something to think about.<br/><br/><b>The Killing Joke</b><br/>Again, I like the idea behind the Move, but because of the Volatile stat swapping and the "target scoring a 7+" trigger, it currently only works with PCs. Which is fine. But if that's the case, I would change the clause to "When you teach another PC an ineffable ancient combat technique\u2026" just to really make that clear.<br/><br/>If you want the move to work with all characters, I'd model it after the Ghost's Hungry Ghost move. Something that presents a list of beneficial options that The Tengu chooses from on a 10 up, but that the trainee chooses from on a 7-9.<br/><br/><b>Mara's Daughter</b><br/>The move works mechanically, but seems really strong. What's stopping the Tengu from just constantly asking people to do things? If they agree, the Tengu gets what they want, and if not, they don't spend any resources.<br/><br/><b>Morrigan</b><br/>I think this one needs a clearer "When you" trigger clause. It seems kind of like The Battlebabe's Dangerous &amp; sexy Move and the Read a Sitch Move, both of which have clearer triggers. I would start this one with something like "When you involve yourself in a heated argument\u2026" Also, for the third option, why can't the people be involved in the fight? Couldn't it just be "Name someone - everyone thinks they started it."<br/><br/><b>Mountain Goblin</b><br/>I like the items. Very Tengu-ish. However there's not enough of a cost for my tastes. Yeah, you take 1 Harm, but in my opinion traveling to a remote location should take time. Maybe turn this into a roll with Volatile with options representing cost (time, effort, suspicion, etc.) on a 7-9 result.<br/><br/><b>On Raven's Wings</b><br/>I like this one. You may run into issues with nothing mechanically backing up the "If someone sees you transforming" clause, but perhaps not.<br/><br/><b>Trololol</b><br/>This ons doesn't have enough mechanical bite for my tastes. "Get someone good" is kind of nebulous. Could you solidify this buy putting something mechanical in it? Like assigning a COndition or dealing harm?<br/><br/>Your Backstory<br/>I think the second line should give you 2 Strings on an arrogant target. Similar Skins (like the Fae) have those numbers.<br/><br/><b>Sex Move</b><br/>I like it.<br/><br/><b>Darkest Self</b><br/>The escape clause is too light (pun) for my tastes. I think the Tengu should have to keep going until they put someone in the hospital. Or when someone convinces them to honesty apologize to someone they've tricked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414536/#Comment_414536" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-22T10:08:58+00:00" title="May 22, 2013 10:08AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I LOVE that when they gain a gang, it's called a committed murder.

They make themselves be the fool in expense of their sense of self-worth.

I finally had time for some edits\u2014what do you think?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Lisa">@Lisa</a>, the crow-of-war thing is present in Japanese mythology as well. The reason for the fusion of joking with warlike has to do with the place where offense crosses over with harm. When we talk about political correctness, harassment, or inappropriate jokes\u2014see the Daniel Tosh incident, the dickwolves fiasco, etc.\u2014the problem often comes up that what is harmless entertainment to one person is serious, possibly severe hurt to another person at the same time. I wanted to literalize that concept a bit with the Tengu.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Esarel">@Esarel</a>, I'm open to having the sex move have more mechanical weight, but I can't really think of anything\u2014can you? I also changed "You're loud" to "At some point, everyone\u2019s seen one of your jokes fall flat. Give everyone a String on you." Does that seem better?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd">@HyveMynd</a>, thanks for the detailed breakdown. Reasoning behind the names:<br/>\u2022 "Anand" is a name associated with the Morr\xedgan myth, but is also Indian, and I like diversity.<br/>\u2022\xa0"Bo" and "Jo" are both syllables in the name of S\u014dj\u014db\u014d the Tengu King.<br/>\u2022 I liked the idea of tengu having names from animals which aren't crows. "Cat" came from "Cat-Eye Willie Claims His Lover," a folk song in which the titular character's clothes are described as "tattered rags like raven's wings in motion."<br/>\u2022 "Eric" and "Lee" refer to the main character and the actor who played him, respectively, in J. O'Barr's <i>The Crow.</i><br/>\u2022 "Jackson" Tengu lolol geddit<br/>\u2022 I originally had "Merlin" instead of "Marilyn"\u2014the tengu were originally any of a number of small carnivorous birds, not just crows\u2014but I decided I needed more female names, and altered it accordingly.<br/>\u2022 Matthew is the name of the Sandman's raven in DC Comics.<br/>\u2022 I needed an explicitly Japanese name, and there's a guy in a couple of my classes named Naoto, so, Naoto.<br/>\u2022 "Rock" sounds kind of like "rook," and rocs are giant mythical birds, so \u2026 yeah \u2026 that.<br/>"Sleepy eyes": I liked the idea of a really stoned-looking tengu who turns out to be really fast and sharp unexpectedly.<br/><br/>The Aristocrats: Good points! I changed it to resemble the Barbarian move "The Upper Hand"\u2014<i>When you manipulate an NPC into thinking some awful mess, misconduct, or catastrophe is merely a harmless joke or an accident, on a 10+ your sharp wit alone counts as leverage. On a 7-9, you or an accomplice can make an offer to the NPC before the GM tells you what it\u2019ll take, and the GM may or may not accept.</i><br/><br/>The Killing Joke: If I go with the choose/choose option you suggested, what if I threw in the list from the Touchstone's "Indomitable"? On a 7-9 they choose one, on a 10+ they and the Tengu each choose one. This is the list, although I'll have to subtract the ones that come too close to the list in Morr\xedgan\u2014<br/>\u2022 Name an npc within your reach. You kill, disable or disarm them (MC\u2019s choice).<br/>\u2022 Name a character within your reach. You redirect their attack to another character within your reach, or else to nowhere \u2014 into the ground or a wall or the sky.<br/>\u2022 Name a character on the scene, but outside your reach. You cross the distance between you before they have time to adjust or react.<br/>\u2022 Name a character within your reach. While you keep fighting, you intercept any attack directed at them and they suffer no harm.<br/>\u2022 Ignore all harm to yourself from an incoming attack.<br/><br/>Mountain Goblin: I like the roll-for-bad-luck idea here. I'm actually going to make it a roll with either cold or dark\u2014partly so the Tengu has something in-character to do when their off stats are highlit, and partly because of the whole struggle-against-your-demonic-nature problem that tengu have with enlightenment. How does this sound?<br/>When you undertake austerities in a remote location, roll with either cold or dark\u2014your choice. On a 10+ you choose one, on a 7-9 the GM chooses one.<br/>~ You pushed yourself too far: take 1-harm extra<br/>~ You pushed yourself too hard: take the Condition drained<br/>~ Something scary followed you back, and takes a String on you<br/>~ Someone inconvenient saw you out there, and takes a String on you<br/>Whatever happens, take 1-harm and return with one of the following items, usable exactly once by you (or whatever dirty rat steals it from you)<br/><br/>Trololol: I added your suggestions as examples.<br/><br/>Backstory: Changed the second line to two strings.<br/><br/>Darkest Self: I added "and you need to make it right" to the escape clause\u2014does that make sense?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rob">@Rob</a>, thanks ^_^<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">@lin_fusan</a>, I like your points although I'm not quite sure how to implement them. Either way, though, I'm adding a "once per scene" tag to Mara's Daughter to discourage spamming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415704/#Comment_415704" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T18:23:17+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  6:23PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morrigan is one of my favorite moves in any AW game.<br/><br/>I don't quite get what Killing Joke is supposed to be.

It really pulls more towards Tengu as teacher/sage. I know it's sourced, but I'm wondering if you might be better off going in a different direction, with Morrigan and Mountain Goblin serving as the callback to play Sojobo and Yoshitsune.<br/><br/>I think you really need a move that lets YOU use a dirty trick or joke in combat. Right now I feel like the Tengu talks a good game, but if the book is about being a little bit dangerous then there should be a way to be dangerous all by yourself. Especially with a name like Killing Joke.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
