Stronger, faster, smarter, more charismatic than the Fuhrer himself, and possessed of a skin not even bullets can penetrate, it is not known if Das Ubermensch has even begun to tap his full potential. He has singlehandedly handed the Nazis victories where defeat should have been certain, and thanks to his efforts, Britain is largely rubble. Though he will wear a traditional military uniform for state functions, he is usually seen flying under his own power into battle wearing nothing but a customized red cape bearing the swastika, unconcerned as he is by environmental extremes, or bourgeois notions of shame and modesty. <br/><br/>But underneath his relentless optimism and almost otherworldly attitude, there is a sense of growing unease. He has begun to realize that the worst threat to The Reich is not external, but indeed the very leaders of the Nazi Party themselves! Their bizarre obsessions and refusal to engage the realities of the situation have, if anything, been exacerbated by the successes of Das Ubermensch, and he is rapidly losing his patience with them. He has no time for these "camps" that have been set up, and sees them as a sign of mental illness, of weakness, and perhaps a sign that he should take control...but to what end? What is this thousand-year empire supposed to achieve?<br/><br/><b>THE JACKDAW</b>: In our world, Franz Kafka was an emotionally troubled writer of dubious health whose stories of angst, fear, doubt, existential dread, and self-loathing in the face of a nightmarishly impersonal and bureaucratic world ended in 1924, when he succumbed to tuberculosis. In this world, the illness forced Kafka to stare his own mortality in the face, and he pushed through his doubts and personal demons to come through the other side, miraculously cured and more physically and spiritually whole than before...just in time to see the Nazi menace begin in its full dark glory. <br/><br/>Reclaiming his family crest as his own, aided and abetted by his sisters and those who follow his lead, Franz Kafka churns out pamphlets by day that are a cross between Viktor Frankl and Thomas Paine, giving those under the heel of the Reich the will to fight back as best they can. By night, he is the Jackdaw, dressed as a man sized raven, whose strangled "KAW KAW!" fills Nazi soldiers and their accomplices with dread. His acts of sabotage throw a wrench into the well-oiled machine of Germany's expansion, and he is Public Enemy Number One in Germany. <br/><br/>However, his discovery of the camps has unhinged him a bit, splitting Kafka and The Jackdaw into two personalities, neither of whom realizes they share the same body. As Franz Kafka, he motivates the Underground and decries the terrorism of The Jackdaw. As The Jackdaw, he strikes terror both psychological and, with his research into mesmerism and mind-altering chemicals, physiological into the Nazi Empire, mocking Franz Kafka as a mewling appeaser and idealistic weakling. The Jackdaw's recent alliance with The Golem has also begun to alarm his followers. He is a dangerous hybrid of Rorschach, The Scarecrow, and V. <br/><br/><b>THE RED DAWN</b>: A Russian soldier on the front lines against the German invasion, he was near death when he found a medallion with the Russian hammer and sickle on it, but made of a strange metal that appeared reddish in color, unlike anything he had ever seen. When he put it on, he was contacted by The Omega Collective, an enigmatic collective of hyper-intelligent beings from the End of Time itself. They told him how to harness the power of the medallion, to aid the Revolution of the Proletariat against all foes, both internal and external. Now, as he faces the red sky of dawn, he must sing The Internationale to recharge his awesome amulet, which harnesses the Will of the People into a solid red light that can do...almost anything. <br/><br/>But the Will of the People is a fickle, fluid thing. For now, the good people of the world are united in war against the Nazi abomination. What will happen when peace comes? His doubts in his leaders begins to rival Das Ubermensch's doubts about his own...<br/><br/><b>THE GOLEM</b>: In a bizarre fusion of cutting-edge science and mysticism, The Golem was created when, at the exact same time, Nazi scientists were about to complete a nuclear fission experiment and a young student of the Kaballah was trying to create a golem to fight for his people. The experiment mysteriously lost power at the same time the young Kaballist was incinerated by mysterious energy, and The Golem came to life. It is fueled by pain and rage, and tasked to gather up the Chosen People out of the camps, and forcibly relocate them to where Israel used to be, by any means necessary. It has generated a nightmarish swath of destruction over Europe, and has deposited many Jewish people on the borders of Palestine. It will listen, within limits, to someone of Jewish descent, and will never attack them, but it responds with wordless violence to anyone else. (It is mute, rarely howling in pain if it makes any noise at all.) It has loosely allied itself with The Jackdaw from time to time. Consider it a cross between Doomsday and The Incredible Hulk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161738/#Comment_161738" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-10T04:57:52+00:00" title="August 10, 2008  4:57AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2008 6:27AM by spookyfanboy.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>RISING SON vs. THE AUGUST MANDATE OF THE MIDDLE KINGDOM</b>: More concerned with each other than the larger war, these two mystics (Rising Son from Japan, The August Mandate from China) duel each other across time, space, and in the Courts of Heaven to see which one shall be chosen to lead Asia into the future, and which must then necessarily submit. Using ancient arts and Taoist-derived alchemy, the two duel each other while attempting to strengthen their countries. <br/><br/>Rising Son had a premonition of doom regarding the bombing of Hawaii, which he did not voice until it was too late. Since then, he has lost some standing in the Courts of Heaven, and now is plagued with even more ominous visions of the future...<br/><br/><b>DR. ATOMOS, THE HUMAN ATOM</b>: A brilliant US physicist in contact with such luminaries as Einstein and Oppenheimer before the war began in earnest, he was able to push through where others had not, duplicating, if only for a few seconds, a fusion reaction in his basement that absorbed him and changed him. <br/><br/>It was reborn as The Human Atom, a black core of dense matter surrounded by a radioactive nimbus of lime-green energy that assumes a roughly humanoid shape. It speaks with a voice that comes out of nowhere, and seems eerily modulated. It is hyper-intelligent, and capable of accurately predicting the future to the limits of the information it has. It can also rearrange matter on the atomic level, giving it near-godlike capabilities. It designs bleeding-edge technology for the Allied effort, and uses it's control over matter to devastating effect: in one swoop it rescued Einstein and many other German scientists from Axis enslavement by teleporting them all to Washington, DC, and it's power as a weapon cannot be underestimated. <br/><br/>And yet, it grows increasingly detached from the world, despite those who need it. It is losing empathy with the human race, and thus its ethics are becoming only directed by logic and curiosity. It has focused on the big picture almost exclusively, and soon no one will be able to predict its actions or its reasoning...<br/><br/>This is the kind of setting that Darkpages inspires in me.
