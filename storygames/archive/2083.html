                    So Alex F had a good suggestion earlier which I like to follow up on with this new thread: 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex F</cite>Can I suggest a much healthier way to look at this side of the argument?<b>Decoupling.</b>I am interested in the extent to which it is possible to decouple the activity of gaming (the imagining, the stories/adventures, the social creative thing) from the other elements typically hitched to it. This doesn't mean that these elements should be taken away from gaming, just that they are free to accompany it or to not do so.</blockquote>
I think this is tricky.  Role-playing will always be associated with its most popular elements rather than with what is inherently a part of the form.  Indeed, I think that while during the RPG boom of the early eighties, "gaming" was associated with RPGs -- that's no longer true.  I was just relating how in the last session of our Amber campaign, I had been surprised by one of the players commenting that she "wasn't a gamer" -- by which she meant that she didn't play video games.  Video games, boardgames (particularly the newer Euro games), and collectible card games are the most common association of "gamer".  Similarly, I think that the terms "role-playing" or "RPG" have generally been decoupled from tabletop play -- nowaways people are more likely to associate role-playing with freeform play-by-post Internet forums or with Massively Multiplayer Online RPGs like <i>World of Warcraft</i>.  <br/><br/>So to first order, I think that decoupling depends on being wildly successful in the new games you put out.  There are some ways that you can be visible out of proportion to the number of people actually playing your game -- i.e. spinning to the media.  However, I'm not sure if anyone would be interested in that.  <br/><br/>So, what are elements that we'd like to decouple from?  There are a bunch of different possibilities: <br/><br/>- Decoupling role-playing from the tabletop.  Being a small, interpersonal activity casts role-playing games as an introverted hobby of playing with a few friends in private.  If games played over an area with a large group became wildly popular (like larps in Scandanavia), then role-playing would be associated with more physically fit and extroverted people.  <br/><br/>- Decoupling from speculative genres (i.e. fantasy/sci-fi/horror).  Those genres are fairly popular overall among movies say.  So I'm not sure if there would be much of a change otherwise.  I think it might appeal better to the older generation (40+ or 50+) since the popularity of those genres is relatively new, but I don't have any data on that.  <br/><br/>- Decoupling from campaign play.   I think this would detach it from the picture of more serious, dedicated gamers.                </div>

<p>Since LARPs already exist, and not all of us are interested in that sort of decoupling, I started thinking about this in terms of what else could be implied by "decoupling from the tabletop". Like, for example, not being tied to a play area, but being able to play in any location, or even while moving. The latter makes me think of Steffan O'Sullivan's <a href="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/sherpa.html" rel="nofollow">Sherpa</a>; the former reminds me of By Dev Purkayastha's <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Colorless_Green_Ideas_Sleep_Furiously.php" rel="nofollow">Colorless Green Ideas Sleep Furiously</a>, a submission to one of the past Game Chefs.</p>

Yes, that's why I cited about decoupling from the tabletop and only cited larps as one example of this.  Another potential case is <a href="http://www.steampowerpublishing.co.uk/don.htm" rel="nofollow"><b>Dead of Night</b></a>, which is printed in "pocket book" format and includes a bit in the back for generating random numbers without dice.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, saying that "LARPs already exist" is exactly like saying "tabletop RPGs already exist".  That doesn't rule out there being very different new larp designs.                        </div>

I'm not sure that removing the more spec-fiction would help, although more variety of stuff could help. I also tend to think that the actual mechanics compared to age group are about as important as subject matter.
<blockquote>- Decoupling from campaign play. I think this would detach it from the picture of more serious, dedicated gamers.</blockquote>
I think decoupling from a certain type of campaign play might help, specifically decoupling from the never ending, "epic" campaign.<br/><br/>I didn't read any of the Leiber Fafyrd and Grey Mouser short stories until the mid-90s, about 15 yars after I first played D&amp;D. When I did, a big o'l lightbulb went on and I think I actually started to understand the game a bit better. See, I came out of a mindset where Tolkien-inspired stuff was the basis of fantasy fiction, which really is sort of a lousy fit with D&amp;D. The Leiber stuff, though, is a pretty good fit. Basically, you have short stories with recurring characters and only limited connections between the stories, which is a whole lot like the module based play I did as a kid.<br/><br/>I think that style still has potential.                        </div>
