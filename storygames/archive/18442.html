My first time playing a full episode, and my first time running it. I had just finished reading the books and we had an open slot this weekend so I wanted to try it. But the game mechanics are pretty traditional and numerous, so before I played I request the help of my g+ communities. <br/><br/>I thought it'd be cool to document here, because there's tons of great advice about how to run a one-shot, and good advice for a GM who's never run the game before. There's also play aids that people made that are quick reference for the rules. <br/><br/>I also did a brief actual play writeup, which I'll put up last!<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Andy Hauge</i><br/>I would recommend to have reference sheets out for the players. Especially for the anatman phases.<br/><br/>Use a scene judge for the first act to introduce the idea of aiki, unless they're already familiar with something like "fan mail" or Old School Hack's Awesome Points.<br/><br/>Keep asking questions, and take copious notes on the current game actions. That helps you stay on top of things.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Brendan Conway</i><br/>Hmmm. Making characters, Kira, means that you want them to put together archetypes at the table, right? <br/><br/>Are you planning to limit the list of archetypes at all? That might be helpful, because then there aren't too many options.<br/><br/>I printed out the chapter for each individual character type I had in my game, and I flagged with post-its all the important rules bits based on the archetypes. I think that can help speed things up a bit, because there's a lot less flailing at pages.<br/><br/>Maybe cut out the individual archetype lines on strips of paper, so that they can be assembled in a column as the players assemble their characters? I think that might help, although I have to admit I haven't tried it. <br/><br/>Please let us know if you try anything that works really well -- I'm curious about getting character creation sped up for a one-shot, because right now it seems to me that handing out pre-gens is almost always the better, quicker option for one-shots. I'd love to be proven wrong!\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Kira Scott</i><br/>Cool Andy, good stuff. Is the reference sheet for the anatman phase the session log sheet I found on the main site?<br/><br/>Brendan... whoo, see, I haven't made a character yet. That sounds more involved than I was thinking it would be. Yea, maybe I'll just like, highlight cool archetype choices instead of passing the book around to cut time.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Andy Hauge</i><br/>Half a second, lemme dig up the documents I've found...<br/><br/>Also, definitely make a few characters, to get a handle on the system.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Andy Hauge</i><br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7t8nEmtbCYFMklneFpZNTR2Vnc/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7t8nEmtbCYFMklneFpZNTR2Vnc/edit</a> is the rules quick reference.\ufeff<br/><i><br/>Andy Hauge</i><br/> <br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7t8nEmtbCYFYzdFQUNnWlNBMjQ/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7t8nEmtbCYFYzdFQUNnWlNBMjQ/edit</a> is a bundle of OODLES of handouts.\ufeff<br/><br/>I would count them to be nigh-indispensable. (I'm not responsible for 'em, just happened to stumble across 'em.)\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Dylan Boates</i><br/>Making characters is reasonably quick, once you know what you're doing (My group just made characters on Wednesday). However, it's SUPER fast if you can find a pregen that hits 90% of what the player wants.<br/><br/>The fastest character we put together was a ninja. We just had to take the ninja pre-gen and swap one style of ninjitsu with another.<br/><br/>The Annelidist was similarly quick, but the different annelids all have different karma costs, so there was a little more book keeping involved in the swap.<br/><br/>You might also take a look at the pre-gen characters from Lotus Blossom's Bridal Path (if you've got it). They did something similar, where there were a bunch of pre-generated characters, but there were notes about how to twist the character concepts a bit. Stuff like "If you don't dig this guy's pacifist thing, you can just swap the non-lethal martial art for another one, maybe this one here!"<br/><br/>This kind of character creation took us about 5-10 minutes I'd say.<br/><br/>That said, creating a character from archetypes is pretty fast. You basically just pick a few archetypes, write down all the stuff each one gets and then divide up your stat points. It probably only takes 15-30 minutes (as long as no one wants to make a custom Yoroi Armour, or one of those similar point buy archetypes, and no one takes forever trying to optimize their archetype choices).\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Andy Hauge</i><br/>I'm actually considering taking an Apocalypse World approach to character creation for a con game--printing up booklets for each pregen with stats and stuff to fill in.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Dylan Boates</i><br/>It might also be worth noting that the "once you know what you're doing" bar is pretty low.<br/><br/>This was actually the first time any of us had made characters, and I'd say "not knowing what we were doing" led to a 10-20 minute delay as I fumbled through the rulebook going "Hmmm... How DO you figure out what your attributes are?"<br/><br/>After that 10-20 minutes of poking through the book, I knew what I was doing and everything was smooth from there.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Andrew Glasscock</i><br/>Just don't get stuck trying to resolve one particular part of character creation, because chances are it's answered somewhere else or it'll handle itself as you keep going. The first game I ran involved a player getting stuck on building his Kijin for three hours, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy...\ufeff                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415325/#Comment_415325" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T07:55:28+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  7:55AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Katarzyna Olszewska</i><br/>Hey, about the rules summary/handouts - the rules pdf contains all the general rules, but the handouts only cover selected rules that I though would be used more often. This is especially important with regards to Aiki/Kiai rules - I need to update the handout file to include all the rules.<br/><br/>Actually, this is as good a moment to do the update as any. I'll post the updated version later today <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>With regards to one-shots and what to expect: I ran several one-shots on cons (4 hour slots) and at home. The speed with which people pick up the system changes vastly. (I always provided pre-generated characters and had rough adventure outlines, so I can't provide feedback on how much time that takes.)<br/><br/>Rules-light/story games people loved Aiki and Emotion Matrix, but though that the game in general had too many rules (this mostly applied to combat and Intermissions; one specific comment was that it would be nicer if Fate ratings were directly involved in rolls that apply to these Fates, similar to Hot War for example).<br/><br/>On the other hand, people from a more "mainstream" con didn't hand out Aiki at all (I did all of it). Some of them, possibly used to lethal systems where damage and errors have high consequences, had problems with grasping the non-lethality/epic fighting mood of Tenra.<br/><br/>(Mind you, I'm not sure that I explained everything well enough either, but it's hard to do a summary of everything in a con slot and not flood people with info, even if you only introduce rules one at a time when they're needed).\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Andrew Glasscock</i><br/>I love love love those cheat sheet references Katarzyna Olszewska ...let us know when they're updated, I'm building one big fat PDF this weekend filled with all the other community supplements people have shared.<br/><br/>I'd say the most important part of condensing the rules for a one-shot, or really whenever you have new players, would be to follow the starting Zero Act procedure (see the "Getting Started" section in the rulebook) as closely as possible. I like to use the starting Fate Roll as an opportunity to say "this roll on Empathy: Fate, using your attribute number of dice and rolling equal or under your Fate (skill) level, is basically how all rolls will work." Zero Act exposition gets everyone comfortable with roleplaying -- I've thought about the idea of giving everyone 1 Aiki during ZA with the caveat that they can't keep it: they have to give it to somebody else. ZA seems too early for the scene judge sheet but you want to encourage Aiki rewarding from the start. Maybe perform one action roll per player during their ZA to really drive home that core Attribute: Skill dice mechanic too.<br/><br/>I feel like I've lost people when I'm starting games as soon as we get into Zero Act, but it's entirely my fault because I forget to do things like the first Fate roll and have to backpedal and distract everyone, so yeah. Familiarize yourself with the start-up and Zero Act processes and everything else should go smoothly. ZA is the foundation you build everything else on, after all...but yeah. Just thinking out loud...\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Katarzyna Olszewska</i><br/>Also if you're interested, here are some threads about one of the TBZ games I ran:<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?663689-TBZ-Critique-my-adventure-setup-characters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?663689-TBZ-Critique-my-adventure-setup-characters</a><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?664766-Tenra-Bansho-Zero-Indiecon-2012-Kagemusha!-postmortem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?664766-Tenra-Bansho-Zero-Indiecon-2012-Kagemusha!-postmortem</a><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?666524-Tenra-Bansho-Zero-Indiecon-2012-Kagemusha!-AP" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?666524-Tenra-Bansho-Zero-Indiecon-2012-Kagemusha!-AP</a><br/>(With shame, I admit I never finished the AP, although I have the notes. This is a good reminder to do it... )<br/><br/>In general, timings wise, I never managed to cram more than act 0, act 1 and a bit of act 2 (usually the final battle) in a single session.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Craig Judd</i><br/>I always forget to call for Emotion Matrix rolls until half-way through the Zero Act, and then I go back to forgetting to call for them later on...\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Katarzyna Olszewska</i><br/>This was my intro to the Emotion Matrix, as summarised by one of the players (who also loved the mechanic and later wanted to roll a lot with regards to events, not just people):<br/><br/>"So, you're standing on the steps to the castle and your mother announces to the crowd that you are now an outcast... Let's see how you feel about her!" (Everyone started rolling on the floor laughing).<br/><br/>In other games I forgot to use it <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> There's a lot to juggle in act 0, especially if you don't have the intro scenes quite nailed down.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Jason Miller</i><br/>I typically find myself using it on characters I want to emphasize to the players. Basically saying "this character will be important to your character" regardless of how.<br/><br/>I sometimes have trouble with the actual implementing of the roll. You want to describe the character that is the focus of the roll enough to give an idea of them but you have to hold back a bit to allow room for the result of the dice. I fumble that a bit sometimes.<br/><br/>The idea of rolling for reactions to events is a fascinating idea to me. Maybe I'll throw the idea around next time I have a game.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Andrew Glasscock</i><br/>I just call it a "gut check" roll, lol. Emotion matrix randomizes your initial reaction...it's a "gut feelings" check.

If it's a test, especially if it's a test, go with the pregens. Not only for the expedience of quickly sitting down, but because they're mechanically simple for a new-to-TBZ GM to manage. TBZ characters can get really, really mechanically involved without the players trying that hard.<br/><br/>* For the purposes of really feeling how the game works, I think you could squeeze in a Zero Act and...two regular Acts. That'll give you a chance to pass through the karma management step once, let people update their fates, and all that. Learning your way around the game's fighty bits will take more time than you realize: it only looks fast when you read it. And each Act will probably have some fighty element to it.<br/><br/>* Don't use any mechanics in your Zero Act, but build it like a bang: Let the player make a meaningful decision.<br/><br/>* Use really, really strong situation framing to set up Act 1 and 2. Use that prologue step between acts to your advantage! It's practically like setting up a new game every time. (I don't think Lotus Blossom's Bridal Shower really puts this to good use, other than making the ship crash...if you have no idea what I'm talking about, I encourage you to read through that scenario). <br/><br/>* Don't try and wing NPCs the first time. Andy's NPC generation guidelines in the rulebook are solid! Build your bad guys in advance.<br/><br/>I forgot to ask: How many players are you going to have?\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Kira Scott</i><br/>Wow Paul that's epic good advice. Thanks!<br/><br/>I'm still reading through the books in their entirety. It won't be a perfect session, but I want it to be a fun session. Our group is pretty seasoned at character creation and mechanics. We made Freemarket characters and played through a scenario in one four hour session.<br/><br/>We're going to have probably 5 players.<br/><br/>You don't think two combats is too many? They seem time consuming.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Paul Beakley</i><br/>Five players is a big game. You're not going to have a lot of time. <br/><br/>My character creation advice has less to do with your players (my player group also has tons of chargen and mechanical experience) and more to do with you GMing them. The basic characters are basic enough that they're easy to run (straight samurai, armour rider, onmyoji, etc.) while still giving everyone a nice taste. New players might not have enough experience with TBZ to evaluate whether their concoction is easy or hard to run. There are just...a lot of very fussy little subsystems in the game.<br/><br/>The point of having a combat each Act is economic: it's the one time that Kiai is most likely to be spent in dramatic volumes. It also keeps your players from plowing everything into character advancement, which early on can unbalance the game's economy in an unfun way. <br/><br/>Incentivizing your players to use the "take an action to convert aiki into kiai" action is super-fun in the game's fiction. That's where you stand up and make a big speech to the bad guy. That doesn't happen until you've bled off most of that kiai.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Kira Scott</i><br/>Cool Paul. That's really helpful. Yea, I was a bit worried about the fussy subsystems, and making a useable or strategic character for a one-shot. I'm guessing that its not that easy to tweak a character for such a purpose without really understanding the rules in advance. Hm.... maybe I'll make characters for them then, based on the pre-gens. I dunno, I just have this like, aversion to pre-gens! Hehe.<br/><br/>YES ok, I see how combats could be more important then. You're right, that makes sense with the aiki kiai conversion. AWESOME this is really helpful.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Paul Beakley</i><br/>p.s. if your interest in having people make their own character is focused on player investment, the Zero Act does a nice job of that. Surprisingly so actually. Between Zero and Act 1 they'll have a chance to tweak and personalize their starting Fates, remember. They'll put their mark on their characters.<br/><br/>Also: it's a short form game, yeah? They need to be invested for four hours, not, you know...four months, or whatever. \ufeff<br/><br/><i>Paul Beakley</i><br/>I'm right there with you re pregens! I haaaaayte them. But not for TBZ. I decided it was a really smart design move once I saw how fate management worked.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Kira Scott</i><br/>I guess you kind of like, start with a template, and then customize. Kind of like *world games.\ufeff<br/><i><br/>Paul Beakley</i><br/>Yes! It's very much like customizing a playbook.\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Kira Scott</i><br/>Things are clicking in my brain!\ufeff<br/><br/><i>Paul Beakley</i><br/>The multiple-advancement-phases-per-session thing also helps players get their hooks into their characters fast since they're like...immediately investing stuff into their characters via Fate updates as well as character improvement buys. <br/><br/>Good luck! Hope it turns out awesome.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415327/#Comment_415327" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T07:58:52+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  7:58AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Actual Play Summary</b><br/><br/>So my Tenra Bansho Zero one-shot went really well! Everyone's advice prepared me for lots of things.<br/><br/>The stuff we loved:<br/><br/>We rolled on the emotion matrix probably way more than we needed to because it was just fun. I was jealous I couldn't roll on it after awhile as the GM! I wanted to have crazy emotions about people, and then decide what that meant. We got dark dreams like a million times, and one time when two PCs met for the first time one got "annihilation" and it prompted an awesome duel. Figuring out how to roleplay the adversarial emotions with other PCs but still keep the plot going was really fun to watch the players figure out, and they really enjoyed the challenge of it. It made some great interactions happen.<br/><br/>Doing a fast paced character creation based on the sample PC's in the back (we basically just took those and modified them and added our own fates to them, didn't really tweak all that much at all and it was fine).<br/><br/>Aiki chits were flying, and so was kiai in the one ninja fight we got to, so people fell into the roll of actor and audience really easily.<br/><br/>The characters were really interesting, and compelling, and easy to understand despite their weirdness. Everyone really got into the characters they could play.<br/><br/>The mechanics, while complex, are really solid. They work! Everyone was interested in trying them out more because they really let you get that anime/chinese war romance/wushu/samurai genre. Yea, like, somehow, all of those things at once. They work!<br/><br/>The things that I surprisingly had trouble with as a GM:<br/><br/>1. The Zero Act!<br/><br/>I love the concept of the zero act, I kind of do something similar when I run Monsterhearts (go around the table and do brief introductions with characters and their families). What I found oddly hard to do was to introduce the character to the scenario with some kind of conflict that gave the player an interesting choice and draw them into the scenario by introducing an NPC they had a relationship with that episode too. For some reason I can't quite put my finger on yet, this was oddly hard to do. I think with practice I'll be able to be more pointed about it.<br/><br/>2. Scenario creation?<br/><br/>I made a rough scenario concept that was familiar enough to be engaging and easy (your lord on the mountain is dying, travel to the valley below to find a healer and save him!). But I found I really didn't have enough scenario or NPCs to drive the plot. The game is far more traditional in that I have to, as the GM, construct a lot of the story, the PCs drama isn't strong enough to guide the story with just their fates. Although the book says it is, individual character fates are more like roleplaying guides than... fruitful points of drama.<br/><br/>3. Framing scenes carefully enough so that there's an audience to give out aiki<br/><br/>I dunno why this was hard, I normally frame scenes with two or three players in them. Something about how to pace this in tandem with specific events tied to the story was difficult.<br/><br/>4. All the rules OMG<br/><br/>I tried to use the rules support that kind people on the internet shared with me, but really when it came down to it, if there was a rules question, we busted out our three copies of the book and searched until we found it. By the end of the session I think we had a grasp on half the rules. It just seems like a bit of a learning curve though, I bet with two more sessions we'd have it down. It's a lot to keep track of as a GM though.<br/><br/>5. Making NPCs<br/><br/>Was also oddly harder than I expected! I wish there were basic NPC stats in the main rulebook.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's supplements I need to help me with this stuff. I'll have to hunt them down.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415345/#Comment_415345" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T11:28:52+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 11:28AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 12:53PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I love this game so much.  I've run it a handful of times, and just prepped for an ongoing campaign (only had time for Zero Act after everyone made characters) and it's gone great every time.<br/><br/>Regarding scenes in the Zero Act, I think of it as basically being the "establishing shot" for a character, a chance for their player to show the rest of the table what they think is cool about their character.  I don't worry too much about contriving a conflict, just having them meet up with a significant NPC and rolling on the Emotion Matrix usually serves to create its own drama for the scene.  If I'm running short on time, like I did last session, I double up the PCs and have the Zero Act cover how they met, or to establish their existing relationship (again, with the aid of the Emotion Matrix).<br/><br/>Along the same lines, I try not to set up TOO elaborate a plot for the session, I basically cook up 2-3 strong NPCs with conflicting or controversial motives, and then let the PCs decide who they're going to oppose or support.  I played the heck out of Feng Shui back in the day, and Robin Laws' advice and recommended HK films basically taught me not to be afraid of melodrama or cliche (though newer, inter-character drama-focused games like Monsterhearts and Smallville are also a big influence).  I think the way Ken Hite puts it is "Bad media makes for good gaming".  In other words, don't be afraid your plot might be too lame, because the PCs are likely going going to run roughshod all over it, and the more loosely plotted it is, the more opportunity they have to put their own spin on it.  I treat my NPCs like props for my players to act out against.<br/><br/>The last time I ran TBZ, my scenario was a deathly ill regent trying to cheat death by having his soul sealed in a kongohki body.  My NPCs were him and his two daughters, a sympathetic onmyoji/Buddhist priestess, and a hard-nosed armour pilot.  That was pretty much my entire prep, and by the end of the Zero Arc the players more or less arranged into anti- (an oni looking for his village, who'd been rounded up as raw material for heartgems, and a renegade ninja repenting for his role in rounding them up for delivery) and pro-factions (a kugutsu who was the lord's new fiancee and the girls' stepmother, and the regent's kind-hearted brother and physician who was secretly an annelidist), and from there the game practically <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/394881#Comment_394881" rel="nofollow">ran</a> <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17649/virtual-play-episode-63-tenra-bansho-zero/p1" rel="nofollow">itself</a>.  If you get everyone in the right frame of mind (and the Emotion Matrix and Fate cycle are powerful tools to this end), the scenery chewing just seems to happen.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you have a group that's more reluctant to dip their toes into PvP territory, that's a lot more work loaded onto the GM to provide antagonism, yeah.  I think it's in-genre (if Tenra's relentless mash-up style can be said to truly have a genre beyond "Rifts") to have alliances of convenience or for even longtime friends come to blows (again, melodrama), and I think the potential for Asuradom and the game being tuned for one-shots by default encourages one to think of their character as a "stolen car", to go back to Monsterhearts again, but if the players don't want to in-fight, they're just not gonna.  I'll have to think on what to do in that case.<br/><br/>And regarding the rules, yeah, Tenra is a lot simpler than the sheer size of the rulebook would suggest, but there are a lot of weird edge cases and special powers, and sometimes things are squirreled away in weird places.  As far as making NPCs goes, I usually just cheat by not giving them a full statting-up but using the on-the-fly shorthand from pages 154-7.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415359/#Comment_415359" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T13:25:17+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  1:25PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really curious about this running itself phenomenon!

I am tempted to say knowledge of the setting isn't that big a thing (I treat Tenra as an implied setting and just wing the details as they come up like I would in, say, Apocalypse World; I was actually taken aback when one of my players suggested setting our campaign in one of the cities written up in the book and I didn't even recognize the name), but then I am fairly immersed in a lot of the media that TBZ is drawing from so I suppose I have an osmotic familiarity with the cultural background noise of the setting... but then on the third hand the book also points out that the country is in upheaval due to the recent unrestrained flow of magitech stuff being provided by the schism in the Priesthood so you also have carte blanche to just discard or handwave any breaches in setting etiquette since the entire social structure is teetering.  I don't think it's really presented as a thing like L5R where the characters are expected to have thoroughly internalized the setting's social structures and rules of etiquette and that knowledge is expected of the players as well.<br/><br/>But yeah, not having to constantly hunt through the book will speed up any game.  Even while making characters quite a few head-scratchers came up; this was our first time not just using pregens and everyone but one person combined archetypes, but that guy decided to build a half-ayakashi/half-oni from scratch.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415376/#Comment_415376" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T20:28:22+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  8:28PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm really curious about this running itself phenomenon!

The GM sets something out, then one of the players finds something interesting in it, then another player builds on that, then another player builds on that, then the GM steers it and keeps building, and so long as everything's tracked down, it keeps snowballing that way.<br/><br/>That requires comfort with the rules, comfort with the world, and comfort with one another. On the GM's end--know the rules, help spread knowledge of the rules, and have a solid idea of how the world generally fits together. Let the players help you fill in the smaller things and the flow of the plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415412/#Comment_415412" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T02:13:53+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  2:13AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm really curious about this running itself phenomenon!

I wrote two adventures, ran one twice, one once; the first one seemed to work much better than the other, both times. The characters in the first were probably slightly more PvP, but overall I think a significant factor was also genre buy in from the players. It helped if they wanted to be more active, make their own entertainment, show off for others a bit and above all: be vulnerable, rather than just be entertained and composed.<br/><br/>I think the "runs itself" phenomenon can happen with any game, but there's no way to cause it (and I don't know if there's any way to teach it). The players need to let go of control, I suppose. They need to "play unsafe". Characters that are entertaining to others/make a good story are rarely what we think of as "cool" (in control, not overwhelmed by emotions, not struggling with problems that seem to have an obvious solution if one isn't emotionally involved). So if the player strongly identifies with the character, and/or has problems with self-worth, they will not let go, they will not play an imperfect character, because they will be afraid of being emotionally vulnerable.<br/><br/>This is also tied to in-group trust: gaming with friends is MUCH better than with people you don't know, because you can be vulnerable among friends.<br/><br/>There are mechanisms which are supposed to reward such risk taking and acting out, like Aiki in TBZ and Artha in Burning Wheel, but I'm not sure if this instinct of trust can be taught in a one-shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415427/#Comment_415427" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T08:24:36+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  8:24AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/carpeguitarrem">@carpeguitarrem</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/3Jane">@3Jane</a><br/><br/>Oh, I know some games that practically run themselves really well! <br/><br/>In contrast, it seems more difficult for Tenra to run itself than... Monsterhearts, for example. The GM has a lot of work to do in Tenra to make the game work. That's why I'm surprised at these stories of Tenra running itself, because where does the plot come from if the GM doesn't make it, and where does the big boss NPC come from if the GM doesn't make it?

I tried a similar game where the randomized emotional character reactions suggested pretty much all the story. An encounter with a character that seemed just like an excuse to a show off from the player's side, suddenly turned into a dramatic scene when the npc went really sad right after being being defeated by the player. Asking the players open questions like "why has your presence make him sad?" and building on their answers pushed the story foward in a way that it felt like the game was running itself. <br/><br/>Some prep for kicks should do a lot of good, but the emotional matrix can do a lot of magic if you built on that. Specially if players have the aiki incentive to show off their "stage skills" portraying an interesting character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415436/#Comment_415436" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T09:47:15+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  9:47AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's the emotion matrix.
