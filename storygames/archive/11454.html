I mean I ran WFRP3 for about three sessions, but other than that I've been relaxing in my role as spotlight-whore player since last summer. That's given other players a shot at doing the GMing thing, but more to the point it's given me a chance to really observe the dynamic of the role from the outside.<br/><br/>Prior to this big break, I was The Guy Who Runs All The Games, at least for my Tuesday group. Thursday has always been more flexible and experimental -- lots of indie stuff, playtests with Eric Boyd and Lxndr, and so on. Also we've only known each other a couple years, whereas Tuesday is comprised mostly of folks who go back to college (with a couple Thu guys now cross-pollinating).<br/><br/>Tuesday night I held a Pitch Your Game night. Anyone with a hankering to run a game could basically make an elevator pitch and field questions from everyone else. Then we'd discuss the merits of various ideas and settle on what we'll do for the next couple months. Two guys pitched BW games, I pitched Trail of Cthulhu. We decided Dave will be running his first BW game (the other guy, Rob, has run BW before). Last time Dave ran anything was...maybe a D&amp;D3, or CoCd20 game, or something, like five years ago.<br/><br/>So we got into setting creation and rough drafts of character concepts. Granted BW is a long ways away from the last thing he ran, but he's played BW very successfully for the past 18 months. He knows the score, at least as a BW player. But two things cropped up: One, being a collaborator/facilitator while wearing the GMing mantle was really hard for him -- I could hear the "this is MY game and MY setting, and I will educate you on what you need to play" versus "hey so...Elric? What do we think? Ideas?" gears grind against each other in his head. <br/><br/>The other thing I noticed was the lack of Dave's credibility as a GM. Some of that had to do with us flatly rejecting the "this is MY game" stuff he was doing...but I think we rejected a lot of that because, well, we don't know Dave in that role. He doesn't have any social credibility, so I guess that means we don't have any trust that what he's pitching will be fun. We don't trust the authority we've ostensibly extended to him. That was interesting. It also pushed some unfortunate buttons in <i>his</i> head, making him feel insecure enough to almost bail on the whole process. But we got through it, largely because I helped facilitate his role as facilitator (!).<br/><br/>Which brings me to my Thursday night group. We set up a Diaspora game a couple weeks ago and we had our first real session last night. Now I had a sort of...similar situation as my Tuesday group happening -- I'd been a playtester or player the past few weeks/months so I think my GMing cred had eroded some. Maybe! Peter Aronson's in the Thu game so he probably has his own take on this. But what I noticed was, there was some tension between me exerting my usual GMing authority versus the players accepting that authority and running with it. I totally get that Diaspora has a thread of collaboration running through it; that's totally cool and I'm comfortable with it. But there was this interesting disconnect between the (very!) familiar GMing social/authority role in my head and how the players deferred to it (or didn't).<br/><br/>My working thesis is that authority and credibility have real-world momentum, and that it's just not in our natures to instantly grant those things even when The Rules provide clear procedures. Credibility is also fungible; I was able to grant Dave more credibility by visibly extending <i>my</i> trust to him on Tuesday -- but I'll bet the same thing wouldn't happen if there was a credibility crisis in our Thursday game night.<br/><br/>So it might be interesting to talk/think about ways to quickly establish credibility in a gaming group. It's kind of a funny construct because we're talking about a leisure activity between friends, or friendly acquaintances, or in the case of a con game, people invested in having fun. A lot of my real-world skills have proven to be enormously helpful in quickly establishing credibility, while others don't seem to get any traction.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's all probably tl/dr. But it's been bouncing around my head for a while.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255188/#Comment_255188" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T07:44:01+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  7:44AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think perhaps your reading a bit too much into this. <br/><br/>Take your new dm guy, did he gain credibility because someone 'presumably' with credibility lent it to him, or because people were seen defering to him (the perception of him having credibility became the actuality of him having credibility) or even because he finally stepped on up and put some players in their place (its not immediately obvious from your description. <br/><br/>Saying that Credibility is interchangible I think is a big mistake. (and furthermore pretty offputting because really any economics term that seems to mean able to be (or covered in ) fungus is a pretty weakass term. I have many circumstances of Credibility not being interchangible, even with the same person, to consider it fungible. <br/><br/>That said, quickly establishing credibility in a gaming group is about the same process as normally happens. Any group will quickly norm out what to do and how to act to certain people. The fact that most games have a 'coordinator to whom we defer' is all most people need to end up acting more or less the same to them (defering to them as they coordinate). This alone maybe the reason why Gm'd games are popular because otherwise the group has to actually norm out its own principals of who goes when, who gets to make the big decisions, who wraps up scenes , and who can talk when which is difficult and will result in more variance than 'the guy in the viking hat, he's the boss' <br/><br/>On the other hand, get your friend a viking hat, with very big horns, (or even another sort of specialized and uncommon hat). Any method of striking him out from the rest of you plebs will give him more credibility, i mean it has worked for more or less every armed force in all of history right? Why not at the gaming table. (you might also send him on a confidence or skills seminar but hey that may be out of your league.0<br/><br/>/delurk<br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255191/#Comment_255191" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T08:15:31+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  8:15AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Two guys pitched BW games, I pitched Trail of Cthulhu.

We also come from job backgrounds where team work and collaboration (two lawyers and a lead programmer) where we are being paid to throw our two cents worth in on any subject we discuss.</li>\n<li>Diaspora's collaborative setting creation (particularly since only some of it ended up in writing in our case) produces both a sense of ownership of the world details and a strong case of "The Blind Men and the Elephant" problem where there are all sorts of hidden disagreements about the setting waiting to come to light.</li>\n<li>Unfamiliarity with Diaspora in particular and FATE in general on the player's part made it difficult to determine when to use a declaration or a maneuver to establish things, and when to simply ask the GM.  Actually, I'm still sort of foggy on that one.</li>\n<li>I think there were some conflicting genre expectations, particularly on the matter of equipment.  Our setup is pretty clearly Imperial SF, like in <i>Traveler</i>, and traditionally in such games, the details of ships and gear mattered.  It clearly doesn't matter to you. That's cool, but it mostly communicated by you saying things like "I don't care about that" or "I hate, hate, hate equipment lists".  It would have been better done if it had been stated up front.  (Also, I had to admit, that I felt it didn't help the fiction that you referred to the same ship as a Gunship, Interceptor and Shuttle in the course of ten minutes.)<br/></li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255201/#Comment_255201" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T09:02:59+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  9:02AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2010 9:10AM by PaulB.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I'm totally not complaining!

I can't speak for anyone else at the table, but I can make some guesses. In my case, I think I elected "let the new guy run" as my highest priority. In one person's case, I think it was "let's play what we know." In another case, I think it was "let's <i>not</i>play the thing we don't know" (if you see the difference). In another case, I think it was "I'm easy, but I'm gonna put my hands on the steering wheel to get at a situation I can sympathize with" (since in this player's case, the initial pitch was a no-go but the prospect of New GM was appealing).<br/><br/>A couple of us have played with Dave GMing. I had a bad experience waaaay back in the past -- basically he cheated in a D&amp;D game to ensure we couldn't use abilities that would break the scenario he'd laid out. But I was also his stongest advocate. Don't know what other opinions were.<br/><br/>Anyway, I kind of...don't want to use this thread as a "please solve my social problems" thread, because I'm totally fine with both my groups. It's an embarrassment of riches! I was just generally ruminating on my own opinions of social dynamics between players, and when those players float to the "top" (!) as GMs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255286/#Comment_255286" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T23:40:52+00:00" title="February  5, 2010 11:40PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>basically he cheated in a D&amp;D game to ensure we couldn't use abilities that would break the scenario he'd laid out. </blockquote>\nI'm sure people remembered his GMing and that's why they were resistant to letting him GM.  People want collaboration in a RPG.  People who are controlling are often disliked.  As GMs they become really bad, because they have the power to be controlling. <br/><br/>How did he cheat?

I'm interested in role-playing as language use in social interaction, and it seems quite clear that the authority of the GM is a construction of the group at the table as a whole. It's like I wrote in my <a href="http://knutepunkt.laiv.org/2009/book/FaceAndFigurationInRPGPlay/" rel="nofollow">paper for the Knutepunkt book</a> last year:\n<blockquote><cite>from "Face and Figuration in RPG Play"</cite>However, despite this blurring [of social and fictional frames in play], we are never confused: we do not mistake the game for reality, the fiction for the truth, nor the parts for their players. Or do we? Consider this excerpt, taken from the early moments of a tabletop RPG game:<br/><br/>[1] (13:30) GM: Rex, didn\u2019t you in fact take out a huge loan to finance the construction of the Redhawk? And doesn\u2019t that mean that if you lose the race, you\u2019ll also lose the company? What do you say to that?<br/><br/>[2] REX RICH: Who\u2019s asking this?<br/><br/>[3] (13:42) GM: I\u2019m asking this\u2026I\u2019m the, I\u2019m the, I\u2019m the, um\u2026ah\u2014<br/><br/>[4] REX RICH:  Well, I mean is there\u2026<br/><br/>[5] (13:47) GM: \u2014I\u2019m the narrator.<br/><br/>[6] [Laughter]<br/><br/>[7] REX RICH: Okaay\u2026<br/><br/>[8] [Laughter]<br/></blockquote>\nWhatever else is going on in that excerpt, there is some kind of loss of credibility on the part of the GM; the guy playing Rex Rich is not convinced. What happens next is a kind of <i>repair work</i> that operates at the social level at the same time as it articulates the fictional:\n<blockquote>[9] TAN-GLIIL: It\u2019s your guilty conscience.<br/><br/>[10] REX RICH (theatrically): Damn! How does it always know? Why now?<br/><br/>[11] [Laughter]<br/><br/>[12] MAX MENSCH: And where does that voice come from?<br/><br/>[13] (14:00) GM: So let me make some, lemme, um\u2014yeah\u2014um, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I should say that what I\u2019m, what I\u2019m, what I\u2019m, um, what I\u2019m looking towards, what I\u2019m eyeballin\u2019 on your sheet is the Aspect\u2014<br/><br/>[14] REX RICH: Yes, but That\u2019s a Risk I\u2019m Willing To Take.<br/><br/>[15] (14:16) GM: Yes, exactly. And notice that one of your stunts is, um, like \u201cGambling Man\u201d\u2014<br/><br/>[16] REX RICH: Oh, okay.<br/><br/>[17] (14:22) GM: \u2014and that means that risk-related compels are doubled in strength, so that if you want to get out of this, you have to pay me two Fate, or you can just take the two Fate. So your company is now on the line\u2014<br/><br/>[18] REX RICH: Oh, I see.<br/><br/>[19] (14:34) GM: \u2014so that if you lose the race, then\u2026<br/><br/>[20] TAN-GLIIL: Then you lose it all!<br/><br/>[21] (14:40) GM: You lose it all.<br/><br/>[22] REX RICH: Well, I can\u2019t make a claim like that without backing it up, so I\u2019ll take it.<br/><br/>[23] (14:45) GM: Okay. That\u2019s a risk you\u2019re willing to take. Good, good, good. All right. Um, okay.<br/><br/>[24] DR. EINSTEIN: That\u2019s a lovely stunt for really amping up your Fate point total. (14:50)</blockquote>\nNotice first in [9-12] how the players back each other up in rejecting the GM's claim at the fictional level to be able to interact with the characters as "the narrator"; they are unwilling to have their suspension of disbelief challenged in so ludicrous a fashion. But then notice how subsequently the players then work to help restore the GM's credibility or authority once the GM changes tack. Rex cooperates with the GM's attempts to clarify his intent with a shift to the game-mechanical level, as does Tan-Gliil at [20]. In [22], Rex acquiesces to the GM's SOTC compel by going back to the fictional level and <i>owning</i> the character aspect. Finally, at [24], Dr. Einstein does something at a meta-level that frames the entire incident as an <i>example of how the rules work and what they allow</i>.<br/><br/>Beautiful! But from these traces emerges very clearly the idea that social authority is a construction of the group rather than something exerted by individual GMs or players.

My point was exactly that: the division of creative authority even in a relatively traditional game like SOTC in not so cut-and-dried, "player proposes, GM disposes," as some people believe. This is a point that's worth making for me because in the tiny, tiny scholarly literature on role-playing gaming, the existence of a GM with special authority is a really big deal: it is one of the defining features of RPGs, in fact.<br/><br/>I talked about this excerpt on an old, now-lost episode of <i><a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a></i>, my brother Mel's actual play podcast.

If you get a well-regarded player who drags his heels or otherwise sabotages the fun, it sort of becomes a battle of wills with the GM's enthusiasm. That probably sounds like good old Forgey GM-bashing but I'm just talking about factory-spec human beings here. <br/><br/>That might even be a useful litmus test: who at the table decides if a game is going to be a go or a no-go? Of course it's lots of people at once, but I'm betting some players are more equal than others.
