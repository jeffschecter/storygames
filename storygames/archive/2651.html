That's not a configuration that a lot of Forge/Indie/Story-Games designs support.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think <em>Play Dirty</em> advice would go well with <em>Sorcerer</em> and <em>TSOY</em>, as they do feature a centralized GM.  I don't know if <em>Dogs</em> really <strong>needs</strong> <em>Play Dirty</em> advice, given how tightly defined the GM is in that game.<br/><br/>That said, I think there are a lot of techniques in <em>Play Dirty</em> that can be incorporated directly into new designs, so that the GM role is tightly defined as in <em>Dogs</em>, with good, solid instructions to guide the GM in what the hell he's supposed to be doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61019/#Comment_61019" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T11:19:02+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 11:19AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2007 11:36AM by Brand_Robins.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark, <br/><br/>Sure. I've told it so many times I thought everyone here had heard it. <br/><br/>So the black stone thing had something to do with the GM taking black stones and every time the players do something disruptive, holding it up, showing it to the players prominently, and then putting it into a bowl. Then when a player is doing something they want to happen later you take one of the stones out, hold it up, and say "YOU FAIL." (This is a rough remembrance, those of you with the book can correct details if you like.) <br/><br/>So I'm playing in a Shadowrun game, and our GM adopts this method. We find out about it when in the middle of a 2 hour long netrun, in which only the GM and the decker are active one of the other players takes out his Magic cards and starts sorting them. The GM objects to this and does said trick with stone. 30ish minutes later someone else goes to use the phone and is gone for like 20 minutes and the GM puts in another stone. <br/><br/>We finally get back into the action when the netrun is done, and soon we're in a car chase. Just as we're about to get away we get black stoned. "YOU FAIL" and we crash and get captured by the cops. At this point I lose my temper, pick up the stone the GM just used, hold it up and then put it on my character sheet. GM looks at me oddly but doesn't comment, and we go back to playing. We escape jail, go to do something else (don't remember what, probably had to do with selling shit we'd stolen) and get black stoned again. <br/><br/>About 15 minutes after that we meet Plot NPC Princess Girl, who is Obviously Important and whom the GM describes with loving attention to detail. I pick up the black stone on my character sheet, hold it up so the GM can see it, and say very clearly, "I shoot her in the face." <br/><br/>Chaos ensues.<br/><br/>Now, where is that Dragonraid quote again? The one about the GM's job being to discipline the players? Turns out a lot of GMs actually believe that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61020/#Comment_61020" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T11:19:37+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 11:19AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I'd be interested to see how people think the book's content can or can't jibe with current Forge/Indie/Story-Games thinking."<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd prefer you to have your own kind of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's just me, eating dogma burgers. ;)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61021/#Comment_61021" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T11:23:46+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 11:23AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Black Stones<br/>\n<br/>\nThat little trick, if I remember correctly, appears in a chapter that has two pages of *WARNING!

A lot of this is being taken out of context. The anecdote is from the "Problem Players" chapter: techniques to use when a re-occurring problem doesn't want to solve itself. It's also prefaced by a lengthy "here's how to actually TALK to a problem player" section. Black stones (and other techniques) are in the book as illustrations of methods to discourage a disruptive player.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust punishing players arbitrarily is NEVER encouraged in the book, nor would I personally encourage it. Gaming, for me, is about cooperative storytelling; emphasis on "cooperative." When someone's consistent bad behavior disrupts that cooperation, it's time to do something about it. Of course, talking to that person is the first step.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I should also mention the "white stone" technique that I wrote about in the same breath. When a player does something that knocks everyone off their feet, I give them a white stone. And, at any time during the game, if another character is in trouble, he can hand that white stone to me and say, "He succeeds."<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT is "good for the goose, good for the gander." ;)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61035/#Comment_61035" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T11:59:17+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 11:59AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True, true, I had forgotten that part.<br/><br/>And if players can throw black stones and white stones into the bowl?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61038/#Comment_61038" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:01:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:01PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *snicker*  Brand's Shadowrun anecdote, shooting the Important NPC, is pretty damn funny.  And I admit that reading John's column (even though I'm an avowed fan of his games) often left me shrugging and thinking he wanted to troll a bit by using a certain tone.  That said, we used a close version of the black stone trick, the karma dice rules he wrote for the <i>7th Sea GM's Guide</i>.  This was a four-year campaign, and we only had Bad Karma used at the very beginning -- mostly to take care of a very annoying player (he cheated and he was obnoxious, but his wife was a great player.)  We used lots of Good Karma, though.  The big adjustment we made was that Bad Karma was directed toward the offending player, not the rest of the group.  We also agreed to give good players more control over the use of their Good Karma.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61039/#Comment_61039" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:02:22+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:02PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then you have Fan Mail, including Angry Fan Letters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61040/#Comment_61040" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:05:24+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:05PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2007 12:06PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Wick</cite>Do you mean "retarded" in the literal sense or the pejorative sense? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote>\nOh, pejorative all the way, of course. <br/><br/>I mean, I do get the idea, I just feel like the social reinforcement is the important part -- and the part where you 'FAIL' them later on is precisely the 'arbitrary' punishment you describe.

Pretending this is not arbitrary punishment seems disingenuous -- because the GM could make the player fail something unimportant if he wanted to be 'nice' or he could make him fail something crucial if he wanted to be 'mean'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61045/#Comment_61045" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:08:07+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:08PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand -- That's awesome.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61047/#Comment_61047" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:08:35+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:08PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, <br/><br/>Plus it can happen to any player, at least the way I remember it.

In other words, it's the GM's perrogative when to use the black stone and when not to use it. If he's the GM, there is an implicit trust given by the players. "We trust you to be fair." Minor infractions draw minor penalties. And, as I've said before TIME AND TIME AGAIN, the primary role of ANYONE sitting at the table is to make sure everybody is having fun. If this technique would ruin your fun, don't use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are groups I've used the black stone with and there are groups I haven't. When I did use it, I was confident the players would respond in a way that wouldn't de-rail the game. But I've played in plenty of groups where that technique would have completely ruined the evening: they would have degenerated into a raging, fuming mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscretion is the GM's best tool. As I say TIME AND TIME AGAIN in the book: "a lot of these things should be used with judgment and discretion. Not every technique is good for every group. Sum up your group and decide what will work and what won't work."<br/>\n<br/>\nI also trust the GM to be fair. Not just throw around his authority because he can. Instead of thinking of the GM as some nameless, formless entity, think of the GM as YOURSELF. How would YOU use the technique? <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, "I would not use it," is a fair response. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, these are not RULES. I think people are reacting to the whole situation without context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61056/#Comment_61056" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:44:24+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:44PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just realized that I've been using ALL CAPS for emphasis which may come across as shouting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis wasn't my intention and I apologize if my tone has come across as angry or defensive because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, sorry about that. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61057/#Comment_61057" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:48:48+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:48PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>what Dave did wrong was be a problem by shuffling his magic cards while he was effectivly taken out of play for 2 hours.

Now you appear to be saying that in fact the book does encourage arbitrary punishment, but that it's okay because everyone has bought in to the GM as arbiter, and we're using the version of 'arbitrary' that is stripped of its negative connotations. So yeah, sure, the initial black stone is also arbitrary -- but the use of that stone later is, uh, <i>arbitrary</i>? The bad version, where the basis of the judgement is opaque and therefore generally perceived as unfair.<br/><br/>Anyways, this isn't meant as some ultra-serious attack, and I am sympathetic to my lack of context. I suppose I'm not a fan in general of solving player-level problems with game-level consequences -- lots of GM advice stuff I've come across seems to suggest this approach. The really terrible examples are often along the 'your player is a min-maxer? min-max an NPC to go kill him for you!' lines, which is clearly not what's going on here. It seems to me that if the simple 'show the player that he is doing something inappropriate' part isn't enough to solve the problem, adding a 'and then punish him later in-game for his previous out of game behaviour!' is only going to make it worse, not better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61073/#Comment_61073" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T13:19:06+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  1:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Wick</cite>I'd prefer you to have your own kind of thinking.<br/><br/>But that's just me, eating dogma burgers. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote>\nI'm trying to glean tasty gaming goodness from all sorts of places to make a tasty RPG gumbo.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the Forge/Indie view serves as my soup stock...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61092/#Comment_61092" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T14:31:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  2:31PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to play an RPG where ONLY the Black Stone/White Stone rule exists.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61095/#Comment_61095" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T14:43:46+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  2:43PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I want to play an RPG where ONLY the Black Stone/White Stone rule exists.</blockquote>\nSounds like a Game Chef ingredient to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61101/#Comment_61101" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T15:00:28+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  3:00PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, that'd be really interesting -

I remembered reading individual columns and thinking I had to take the advice with a grain of salt and the tone with some indulgence.  Interestingly, I think the writing works much better for me as a standalone compilation than as individual columns; it adds a certain distance and makes the tone an effort to jolt the reader into thinking, rather than flamebait.  (I assume that was the original intention too, but it didn't come across quite the same way, at least for me.)<br/><br/>Anyhow, there is some good advice in there, and some ideas that have since become predominant in a lot of story games.  Sure, a lot if not most of it you may have seen elsewhere, but the grouping of these tips and tricks generates some reflexion of its own.  It was a good opportunity to ask myself as GM "Do I do this?  If not, why not?"; and as player, "Do I want my GM to use this trick?  Why, or why not -- and how do I communicate that to the GM?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61369/#Comment_61369" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T18:06:33+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  6:06PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My copy of the book was delivered to my office late this morning, just in time for some lunchtime reading (thanks to John... well, John's roomie.. who's also a John.
