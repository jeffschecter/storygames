I mean, isn't this just a necessary component for life?<br/>Aren't most things, made by people, an attempt at certainty?<br/><br/>I don't wanna fall asleep on some random bed at night, I wanna fall asleep on my bed.  But if that bed, that I expect to be there, is no longer there, then it's dramatic.  It's dramatic because of my expectations. The drama's not coming from the mystery.  Maybe I give two shits about this lack of a bed?  It's because I cared about the old bed, cared enough for protagonist(me!) to leave my once comfortable apartment.  <br/><br/>My dependence on this bed was a lie.  Why?   Maybe this new bed-less existence, is on the surface, better than my old bed-having one?  Maybe I've tricked myself into thinking everything's fine just as long as I have a bed.   <br/><br/>Games are quite capable of uncertainty, but for synchronicity, and the oftentimes karmic justice of story, they often fall flat.  <br/><br/>A mystery is only as good as the feeling had before it disappeared.   Even a story with a windfall, is about something missing.                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480513/#Comment_480513" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-18T20:58:55+00:00" title="February 18, 2019  8:58PM">February 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uncertainty is not so complicated. Drama, it has to be defined because it could mean Greek drama, Theater from the XIXth century, Important action in a fiction, Tense relationships.<br/>In RPG, I use Drama with the last two definitions : the action (opposing it to the Theme) or conflict between (player) characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480541/#Comment_480541" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-19T15:21:35+00:00" title="February 19, 2019  3:21PM">February 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh.
