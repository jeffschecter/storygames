Eric J. Boyd asked me if I'd be willing to "elaborate a bit on what happened in a separate thread", so here we are. I sat out for the majority of the game, with six of my friends playing together and me commenting on rules and observing.<br/><br/>The start of the game went pretty well. People were very good about working together to create characters and a basic setting. The map was a bit silly, but actually got less so as the game went on. The players went for a game about space pirates, starting with a Protagonist, a Badass Woman, and a Man Without A Past. They did very well creating their Motivations, Virtues, Flaws, and Fates, and things seemed to be going well.<br/><br/>Then they actually started telling the story. This is where the shit hit the fan.<br/><br/>The story went nowhere. One could get the feeling that there were little bits of things happening from time to time - evil ninja ships destroying the pirates' territory - but no one actually made these affect or even seriously interact with the main characters. People were obviously trying to plan out what their narrations would be, but other people took things in such different directions that it threw everything out the window every five minutes or so.<br/><br/>The thing I'm saddest about is that the Visions system failed utterly. For those who've never seen CL, the basic idea is that everyone writes down some Visions: things they want other people to describe in the game. These stay hidden. You foreshadow to get other people to describe these things, and then whomever describes it gets dice to roll later. In about an hour and a half, only one Vision came out, and it was utterly by coincidence.<br/><br/>Now, not everything failed. The system for interrupting others worked great - holding up different numbers of fingers for different types of interruptions, yelling "objection" for serious problems, etc. Character role abilities also saw some use, which is good. It's just that what I thought would be the <i>living, breathing heart of the game</i> failed utterly.<br/><br/>Some suggestions that I and the players had once we broke:<br/>1. Make some of the Visions public.<br/>2. At the beginning of each Act, set three things that should happen by the end of this Act.<br/>3. Brainstorm about villains and dangers at the beginning.<br/><br/>I would love to hear suggestions from other folk about what might help get this working better.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75472/#Comment_75472" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T13:53:41+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  1:53PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin,<br/><br/>Glad to see you wrote this up. I really like what you've got going on with Console Legends, and I agree that Visions are a hot concept. Allowing foreshadowing clearly is not enough to get everyone on the same page. Adding structure both during prep and during moment-to-moment play may help Visions get used more. Some concrete suggestions:<br/><br/>-Have a Vision consist of both a particular story element (item, person, etc.) and what happens with respect to it (gets killed, is stolen, helps the heroes, etc.). So a Vision would be: "The Duke of Blanston is assassinated." <br/><br/>When the particular element enters the narration a player is providing (your own or someone else's), the players put a die on each facedown Vision containing that element. So the narrating player immediately knows that there's a Vision involving this element, now they just have to figure out what to do with it to get that bonus die. When you foreshadow, you mention the element yourself and put a die on your Vision for it, then turn over the narration and see how the next narrator follows up knowing that a bonus die is available for continuing to use that element.<br/><br/>I think this might work better than making Visions truly public knowledge; you know what story elements have Visions connected to them, but you don't know what the actual content of the Vision is. <br/><br/>-Having goals for each act is a great idea. The current structure is inspired by the games it wants to emulate, but nothing actually imposes that structure on the narration. Maybe you could provide a list of general goals or plot points for each act stated generally derived from actual games. Then at the beginning of each act, the players pick several they actually want to appear and write them down somewhere to clearly note the goals of that act. I don't play these games myself, but I'm betting there are common tropes that you could turn into these lists to provide a solid skeleton to organize play and keep it directed. <br/><br/>-Adding more brainstorming at the beginning also will help. In my game "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries," I have the players brainstorm a list of possible hazards that can be used at each location that will be visited during the expedition. Now, none of these have to be used, but they put the players on the same page and guide the story while also allowing spontaneous developments on the fly. Adding a similar phase to your prep, along with specific goals for each act, may overcome that wandering feeling of play you saw.<br/><br/>Hope this helps. I'd be happy to bounce some more ideas around, too.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth" title="QHudspeth"><img alt="QHudspeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://quentinhudspeth.com/journal/wp-content/themes/atahualpa/images/H%20Logo%20super%20extra%20small.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth">QHudspeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75936/#Comment_75936" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T12:20:19+00:00" title="June 15, 2007 12:20PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Eric's ideas for denoting a pinged Vision. I was going to suggest opening them up, via Story Triggers, which is what I'm thinking of doing for Amnesia. But I'd try Eric's suggestion first, and keep them secret for the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
