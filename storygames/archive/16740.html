It is completely free to download, to reproduce and distribute. It tells the story of a group of four heroes, their journey across the land of Anarktica, and their encounters with its inhabitants, creatures, monsters and mysteries. Outwardly brave and resolute, each hero is saddled with a terrible secret that tears at their soul and taints their trust in their companions until finally they encounter the Adversary and their true nature is revealed. <br/><br/>It's a low prep, quick playing scenario based on the <i>Archipelago 2nd edition</i> rule-set by Matthijs Holter and inspired by its gaming offspring <i>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0</i> by Matthijs Holter and Jason Morningstar. It requires five players and should take three to five hours. <br/><br/><b>Where can I get it?</b><br/>Download it from here <a href="http://richard-williams.com/anarktica.php" rel="nofollow">http://richard-williams.com/anarktica.php</a><br/><br/><b>More about the rules</b><br/>- The structure of scene framing, contribution and story element ownership is exactly that of <i>Archipelago </i>and it uses the same ritual phrases as <i>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0</i><br/>- Like <i>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0</i> you have a fixed choice of one of five characters to play - one of four Heroes or the Adversary<br/>- There's inbuilt character imbalance - playing as the Adversary is very different from playing as one of the Heroes. (And, in a smaller way, one of the Heroes is given a means of controlling or restraining one of the others.)<br/>- There's a means of pacing the game by choosing to 'Journey' or to 'Rest'.<br/>- There is (almost) no initial character set-up, instead you make decisions about your character's abilities and nature when you encounter certain elements of the fiction.<br/>- The one decision you have to make at the beginning is the nature of your character's Terrible Secret. These are the equivalent of the Dark Fates from <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, but - rather than being drawn randomly - you pick from those suggested by the other players.<br/><br/><b>Creation</b><br/>- The game had an unusual birth. It was created by a group of four strangers (only two of whom had met before) at one of the London Indie RPG meetups as part of a 'create a new game in the first session and play it in the second'. We followed a pre-defined process to first gather inspiration, choose an idea and then develop the concept and the characters. We played the resulting - extremely raw - scenario (which we named Fate of Heroes) in the second session. With agreement from the others, I took what we made away, developed it further, and this is the result. <br/><br/><b>What it's worth</b><br/>Writing <i>Anarktica </i>was never intended to be a commercial project. The time and effort it took were part and parcel of the commitment I originally made to complete it. But I'm proud of the result; I want to share it with as many folk as are interested, and I'd like to give them a means - if they want to - to do more than just say 'Thanks'. <i>Anarktica </i>is completely free for anyone who wants to play it, but if they do play it, and enjoy it, and have the means and the interest, then there is a note inside the book which asks them to make a donation of whatever amount they feel the game was worth to them.<br/><br/><i>Anarktica </i>is built on <i>Archipelago </i>by Matthijs Holter and inspired by <i>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0</i> by the same author &amp; Jason Morningstar. Matthijs and Jason decided to donate all profits from <i>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0</i> to the Mines Advisory Group. They both very kindly allowed me to use their work to create <i>Anarktica </i>and so I, likewise, encourage donations to MAG to honour their kindness.<br/><br/>You can donate at<br/><a href="http://www.justgiving.com/anarktica" rel="nofollow">www.justgiving.com/anarktica</a> (UK) or<br/><a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/anarktica/anarktica" rel="nofollow">www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/anarktica/anarktica</a> (US)<br/><br/>The Mines Advisory Group is a neutral, impartial humanitarian organisation dedicated to clearing the remnants of conflict and enabling the recovery of affected people.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382540/#Comment_382540" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-16T16:54:46+00:00" title="June 16, 2012  4:54PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2012 5:00PM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Release</b> <br/>Not only is it free RPG day, but it's also the June day for the <a href="http://http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=162" rel="nofollow">London Indie RPG Meetup</a>.

I really appreciate the care you've taken in the design and layout.<br/><br/>The only glitch I've noticed is that, in the character sheets, the spacing of the text at the top ("By the order of Lord Newton\u2026") is pretty messed up. The letters are jammed too close together, and in some places the inter-word spacing is too large. The same thing happens in the text underneath "You own the elements of\u2026".<br/><br/>This <i>might</i> just be a compatibility problem with the PDF; I'm viewing it with the Preview app on OS X 10.7. If you don't see any problem with that text, I can upload a screenshot of what it looks like to me. In that case I'm not sure how to fix it; the same Bodoni-like font is used elsewhere and looks OK there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382563/#Comment_382563" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-17T03:51:34+00:00" title="June 17, 2012  3:51AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm... if you look on the above images you can see how it looks when I printed it out.

Or should it just be ditched entirely either like Archipelago or have a set structure like Montsegur?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390589/#Comment_390589" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T15:23:39+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  3:23PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2012 3:34PM by whduryea.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Richard,<br/><br/>So I talked a bit about my experiences playing the Adversary on our podcast episode, but I don't feel like I said everything I could have.<br/><br/>For the record, I really like the idea of an asymetical GM role that grows over the course of the game. I think that's a cool concept, and I like the fact that it gives the player characters more agency to shape the story they want to see in the early game while still centralizing power at the end of the game to create the cohesiveness that you need for a satisfying climax.<br/><br/>However, I definitely got a serious cat-herding sensation, especially during the early game. I felt like the players were running off in all sorts of directions and had a lot of anxiety about the fact that I would somehow have to make sense of it all in the end. I also felt like the ritual phrases didn't do much to help them (or me) find direction.<br/><br/>I think if there were stronger consensus-building mechanics in the early game, it would make the transition of power to the Adversary a lot more seamless and the role more fun to play.<br/><br/>(I actually had a blast as the Adversary once the Final Confrontation hit and I got an idea of what to do just in time, but it was kind of passive and nerve wracking before that.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
