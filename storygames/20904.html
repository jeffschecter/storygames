Finally, we have one new player, although due to scheduling we've only seen them once so far.<br/><br/>I've tried some new tricks in this campaign, but as always I'm tinkering with stuff as I run it. (One day, maybe I'll get things right...)<br/><br/>Below is the teaser trailer I made for the campaign, and once again there's an <a href="https://theunansweredquestion.obsidianportal.com/" rel="nofollow">Obsidian Portal site</a>.<br/><br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-rc6uRDddcr0?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc6uRDddcr0"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/rc6uRDddcr0/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458761/#Comment_458761" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-19T19:36:36+00:00" title="December 19, 2016  7:36PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2016 7:37PM by Aviatrix.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Character and Rules Introduction</b><br/><br/>Let's meet our characters!

This worked well enough, although there was a bit less interaction between the characters than I would have liked, and I didn't quite make the supernatural section creepy enough. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOOHRFdUFGZFIxZnM/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Here's a link to the cards I made</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458762/#Comment_458762" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-19T19:39:00+00:00" title="December 19, 2016  7:39PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Unanswered Question: Prologue 1 (Before the Wedding)</b><br/><br/>The wedding of James Francis Grey, the son of the current governor of California, Bradley Grey, to Ariadne Wright Devilliers, daughter of a family friend, was held on the shores of Lake Tahoe in September of 1955. Ariadne's college friend Temperance Murphy was there as a bridesmaid. The bride's uncle, Jimmy Wright--freshly scraped up from whatever ditch he had been living in all these years--was there too, folded and spindled into a tux.<br/><br/>Candace Heartbrooke, a professor at Wellesley, pushed her way through the reception crowd to the bar. Behind it a Chinese-American man wearing dark glasses was mixing drinks, relying on his sense of smell to find the right bottles. He had a long pointed beard and a rather hang-dog expression that occasionally was enlivened by his brilliant smile.<br/><br/>"Why Mr. Chiu! What a pleasure to see you!" said Candace.<br/><br/>"Thank you," said Charleston. "Wish I could say the same. What can I get you?"<br/><br/>"You know what I like," she said, smiling.<br/><br/>"We're off to a hot start then." He poured her a scotch, neat of course. "There will be dancing later, but I don't think they let the help join in."<br/><br/>"Oh, maybe we can sneak one in."<br/><br/>"We'll see...or maybe we won't!" He chuckled and Candace laughed louder than she wanted. <br/><br/>"How is the job treating you?" she asked, watching him continue to mix drink orders.<br/><br/>"Fine so far."<br/><br/>"You are a man of many talents."<br/><br/>"I'm a man of a very specific talent that I use in a variety of ways. They seem satisfied with the results so far." He nodded at the overflowing tip jar. "You should be out there flirting."<br/><br/>"I don't know these people that well. The bride's my cousin but we're not close. My mother was so disappointed when I told her I was declining the invitation...eventually I had to give in to her."<br/><br/>"You never know, maybe you could find somebody."<br/><br/>"Among all these uptight rich people?"<br/><br/>"If they were so uptight, they wouldn't have hired Charleston Chiu as a bartender."<br/><br/>"Perhaps they don't know you very well."<br/><br/>"Probably it's a combination of both. If you dig underneath the surface, you'll have a lot to write about. You still do that?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes. Keep an ear out for me, I'd love to meet up later and find out any tidbits."<br/><br/>"Oh you incorrigible flirt! Have another drink," said Charleston with a smile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy Wright stood on a rise by the shore, looking out over Lake Tahoe. The deep blue waters lapped the shore and the breeze on his face was refreshing. He fingered something in his pocket.<br/><br/>It had been a long road. <i>So much blood on these hands</i>, he thought. Such a long time since he'd been to a party like this.<br/><br/>He stood there a long time, until the strains of the orchestra brought him out of his reverie. He checked one last time that the old diamond ring he had been turning over in his hands was tucked back in his pocket, then turned away from the lake and walked back toward the lodge. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Charleston remembered:<br/><br/>He was running through the mountains. This was somewhere in China. Somewhere in 1944. He stumbled over the stones, shouting out "Jimmy! Jimmy!"<br/><br/>Jimmy Wright stepped on his cigarette and raised his rifle at the sound of someone crashing through the brush. "Who's there?"<br/><br/>"It's me, Charleston! I can't see in the dark! I can't see at all!"<br/><br/>"What are you doing here?"<br/><br/>"It was me who burned the village in the mountains! It was my village, I could do what I wanted with it. We've got to get out of here..." Charleston swung his head around nervously, as if afraid that someone was following him.<br/><br/>"There's a place nearby..." began Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Did you say <i>place</i> or <i>blaze</i>?"<br/><br/>"Francis is in the area. But place." He pulled Charleston's hand to his shoulder. "If you weren't so heavy I'd carry you."<br/><br/>"I don't know why you want me to watch behind us, I won't be any use."<br/><br/>"Why are you <i>here</i>?" groused Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Why are you here? I came here to burn down and put an end to what I started."<br/><br/>"Government."<br/><br/>"Do you always get caught up in everything the same way?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Someone calls you up with a job nobody else can do?"<br/><br/>"Yes. Yes."<br/><br/>"I guess I shouldn't complain. I'm asking you to do a job nobody else can. We've got to get out of these mountains..."<br/><br/>"Yup. By the way, take a deep breath..."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>Fortunately the drop down to the river was less than thirty feet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Temperance was finishing getting dressed up in the bridesmaid's suite. She remembered another wedding, when she was a little girl. This was only a few years after her father had brought her to live with him. But this was a memory of her mother, of the time they had gone to a wedding together, with her other family: her stepfather and half-siblings.<br/><br/>She had finished putting on her new party dress and went to find her mother, walking through the hallways of the old hotel her mother's friends had rented. She came to their suite and peeked in through the door, which was open a crack.<br/><br/>Ruby was sitting on the bed, dressed in her fancy gown. But her artificial arm was unbuckled and cast to one side. The vanity was a wreck; it looked like Ruby had swept everything to the floor and smashed the mirror. Her mother was facing the wall, scratching it with her good hand as she was seized in some paroxysm of anxiety. For a second she caught Temperance's eye and tried to freeze her face back into a mask of respectability.<br/><br/>She didn't quite succeed.<br/><br/>Temperance blinked away the memory. She put away her makeup neatly in her carrying case and headed out of the suite.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458764/#Comment_458764" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-20T00:38:45+00:00" title="December 20, 2016 12:38AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jimmy didn't walk off by himself at the end of Eternal Lies.

I generally consider the write-ups to be "canon" for determining the course of previous events, which means sometimes things that I elided a bit or added post-session are now the "official" version of events, if that even means anything. Like a movie or a long running TV series, sometimes this means looking the other way--like, how old is Governor Grey? I had him tagged as early 40s, I think, in PMON, which wold make him about 70 in UAQ. That isn't completely out of range, of course, and might be why he loses or doesn't run against Pat Brown in 1958. (Removing the Brown political dynasty from California is too big a timeline divergence for me, unless I come around at some point to mapping the Carlyle/Grey family onto the Browns; that's a bit dicey, given that Bradley Grey is a Republican, but OTOH having a moonbeam Carlyle as governor of Cali is fun.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458770/#Comment_458770" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-20T15:47:40+00:00" title="December 20, 2016  3:47PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Unanswered Question: Prologue Part 2 (Las Vegas, 19 June 1953)</b><br/><br/><i>Las Vegas, 1953. June 19th in fact. The big story is the Rosenberg's execution, which will happen around sunset. Freddy Blakely had invested in a new casino, the Duke, which was opening that night. Most of the people attending the opening were excited about being able to watch the atom bomb test which was also scheduled for sunset.</i><br/><br/>Temperance stepped off the bus. She dragged her suitcase behind her down the strip, her bible tucked under one arm, a long rosary swinging around her neck as she walked past the Duke Casino. Almost against her will--she really was a nice, upright young lady--she glanced inside at the gaming tables.<br/><br/>She stopped. So many tourists. So much <i>ignorance</i>. From here she could see at least four betting mistakes just at the nearest blackjack table. Without quite realizing why--not at a conscious level, that is; as you might suspect with a half-pirate father she had been playing cards since she was old enough to hold them--she walked inside the casino and drifted to the poker table.<br/><br/>"Would the lady care to play a hand?" said the dealer consolingly.<br/><br/>"Oh...it's been such a long time...I wouldn't want to lose my money..."<br/><br/>"Please, madam. Here's five dollars on the house."<br/><br/>Temperance tucked her rosary into her blouse and slipped her bible into her suitcase. "I suppose I could stay for one hand..."<br/><br/>Three hours later, one of the casino executives sidled up to her. "Perhaps madam would like to stay in the Presidential Suite tonight as our guest."<br/><br/>She put down her hand and tidied up one of the tall stacks of chips in front of her. "If it's open, I suppose that would be nice."<br/><br/>"Oh, it's open. We would like to keep you here long enough to win back our money," said the exec with a grimace.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The bellhop unlocked the door and led Candace and her companion into a sumptuously appointed guest suite. "Right this way, ma'am. You'll see that there are multiple bedrooms, a balcony here overlooking the pool, and a brand new 14" console television with a built-in Hi-Fi set."<br/><br/>"How decadent," murmured the man standing behind her. "It reminds me of when I was growing up." He had an odd accent, not-quite British, but something else.<br/><br/>"We deserve to treat ourselves, Vladimir," she said.<br/><br/>"Yes, I tried to treat myself in Russia and look how that turned out," said Nabokov, frowning. "This is very nice, though. I suppose it was the least the awards committee could do for you. I can't say that it makes me think any more of your prize. Unless you could put in a word with the Pulitzer people..."<br/><br/><i>[TP: If he has Mexican for dinner, he can have a bu-ree-to, the tip of the tongue making a trip of three steps...</i><br/><br/><i>Me: Stop it. You get that one time.]</i><br/><br/>"Just relax. Have fun."<br/><br/>"I have so many lecture notes to write. It is impossible to teach Russian literature to these children."<br/><br/>"That's what you're here for. We need you!"<br/><br/>"We should have a drink first. Shall we head to the bar?"<br/><br/>"Absolutely," said Candace with a grin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Outside the casino a weatherbeaten old man stopped. He was covered in dust. He could make his own sandstorm just in the breeze from the A/C. Next to him was a sorry-looking basset hound. The dog looked mournfully up at him.<br/><br/>The man clapped the grit off his hat and stepped into the casino. He limped to the bar. "How much for a glass of water? It's for Betty," he said, jerking his chin at the dog.<br/><br/>"Buck fifty, old-timer," said the barkeep, clearly trying to give him the bum's rush.<br/><br/>The man started to claw through his pockets. A big-hatted Texan in a western jacket with sequins and the shiniest cowboy boots anyone had ever seen sauntered by, two amazing blondes clutching his elbow. "Hey, fella, you look like you could use some luck," he said, and tossed a $50 chip to the hobo.<br/><br/>The dusty man sighed, and limped into the casino. "Pardon me, miss," he said to a pretty young lady who was carrying a tray of chips over to the cashier's window. "Do you have fifty for a chip?"<br/><br/>"Sir, keep the chip," said Temperance, brushing the dust off her sleeve. "Here, take fifty dollars. Do you have a place to sleep tonight?" she asked with the combination of condescension and cluelessness only the privileged can pull off naturally.<br/><br/>"Under the stars," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Sir--" she began. The basset hound gave a low moan. "Oh. You have a dog."<br/><br/>Betty sniffed at her feet.<br/><br/>"I have a room in this casino," she continued. "Here, take this, they'll let you right up. And the dog. Just give them my name. Temperance Murphy."<br/><br/>Jimmy paused a long time. "Temperance..." he muttered.<br/><br/>"And what is your name?" she beamed.<br/><br/>"Uh...Jack Jackson."<br/><br/>Betty rolled her eyes.<br/><br/>"And this is Betty, my companion,' he said.<br/><br/>"What a lovely dog," said Temperance dubiously. Betty gave another mournful howl.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Awwwroooooo...</i><br/><i>HP: What is she, a wookiee?</i><br/><i>Me: Betty, lock in auxiliary power!</i><br/><i>TP: I know pal! I missed you too!]</i><br/><br/>"Temperance Murphy, eh?" said Jimmy. "What a lovely rosary you have on."<br/><br/>"It was a gift from my stepfather. He gave it to me when I was a young girl. It was an auspicious night. He was saying goodbye to an old friend of his. He felt he needed to give me a gift. What was that man's name? It was something with a J as well...John? Jeremy? Ah, Juan. Cousin Jaun from Spain. Lovely party."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The blind man tapped his way across the casino betting floor with his white cane until he pulled up at one of the blackjack tables and perched himself on a stool.<br/><br/>The dealer boggled. "Sir is clearly pulling our leg," he said.<br/><br/>"Relax. I've done this before. I have a plan." He turned to Candace, who was sitting next to him. "Please, if you could read the cards for me, I promise you'll be visited by Lady Luck."<br/><br/>"Sure," she said, sipping her drink. "Candace."<br/><br/>"Charleston."<br/><br/>The dealer slid out some cards. "Ten to the lady. Four to the blind man. Hitting or staying, Kreskin?"<br/><br/>"Hitting."<br/><br/>Behind her, Vladimir groused at Candace. "We should play baccarat. Much more civilized."<br/><br/>\u201cHit again,\u201d said Charleston when Candace whispered in his ear he\u2019d been dealt the King of Hearts.<br/><br/>"The gentleman is busted," said the dealer. "Twenty for the lady, a winner."<br/><br/>"I told you luck follows me everywhere I go," said Charleston to Candace.<br/><br/>"But unfortunate for you."<br/><br/>"Don't worry, life's a series of peaks and valleys. I'm just glad to be helping other people out."<br/><br/>"I'm sure Vladimir would find your case interesting and poetic...bringing other people good fortune but never sharing it..."<br/><br/>"Yes, I would know nothing about that," said Nabokov, draining his martini.<br/><br/>"I suppose that's one way to look at it," said Charleston.

After a few hands I'd love to take you over to the bar and tell you about some of my stories."<br/><br/>"I'd love to hear them," she said, elbowing Nabokov.

Not like my other book."<br/><br/>"You're a writer?" asked Charleston.<br/><br/>"Yes. I'm here to receive an award for my first novel." She shot Nabokov a glare.<br/><br/>"Very impressive. I wrote a book once."<br/><br/>"How nice to meet another author. Are you here for the award ceremony?"<br/><br/>"No, but I'd love to attend. I'm always jealous of those whose written works are appreciated. Mine didn't go over so well."<br/><br/>"Don't give up! Keep writing, you'll get better.

Everyone stared out over the purpling desert.</i><br/><br/><i>There was an intensely bright flash on the horizon. For a moment people could have sworn they saw a green flash just as the bomb detonated, but they could never be sure. A few minutes later, the awful </i>CRACK<i> of the shock wave rolled over them, and they turned to go back into the building.</i><br/><br/><i>An hour later the sandstorm swept in, harder and faster than anyone had ever seen. The sky went black. Soon the casino was a tiny island of light in a sea of darkness.</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Things began to happen. None of the people there would ever fully remember what happened in the inky blackness. Some remembered that the TVs scattered around the hotel--so that the gamblers could watch </i>I Love Lucy<i> while at the blackjack table--began to show some strange kind of </i>Playhouse 90<i> drama. Something really bizarre though, stylized, unrecognizable.</i><br/><br/><i>Other people saw things...or people...</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Candace woke with a start. Everything was still so dark. The wind wailed outside. She got up and walked into the living room, clutching her nightgown close to her. She went over to the bar to get a glass of water.<br/><br/>Out of the corner of her eye, she thought she saw something. Some darkness darker than the rest of the room. Something animal...she could feel the heat of it.<br/><br/>"Vlad, are you awake?" she called out. She could hear the Russian's gentle snoring from the other bedroom.<br/><br/>She picked up her glass of water and walked over to the window. There were no stars out. She felt the same sort of <i>presence</i> behind her. She turned.<br/><br/>It looked like the silhouette of a man. He was tall, the shade of his head bent down as if looking at her. He was wearing an army uniform. She blinked. The figure was still there. <br/><br/>She saw a flash of light from his wrist. The...thing...was wearing a watch. The same watch she had given her husband before he left for the war.<br/><br/>She walked, as if in a trance, into her bedroom. <i>Not like this</i>, she thought. <i>I don't like to remember him as a soldier.</i> The presence was following her. He was close enough that she would have felt his breath on her neck, if he had any breath.<br/><br/>She climbed into bed and pulled the sheets up and rolled over to face the wall. She felt the bed sag under weight, as if someone was sitting down on it, then swinging his legs up to spoon her.<br/><br/>She screwed her eyes shut. "I love you but I need my rest!" she said.<br/><br/>The weight lifted off the bed gently, as if it was ice melting away rapidly. She opened her eyes and wept.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy lugged himself out of the bath and wiped steam off of of the mirror. He took out a cutthroat razor and lathered up. The lights flickered for a moment.<br/><br/>He paused, the razor held up high. <i>Nothing is going on</i>, he said to himself. <i>All that's over</i>. The lights flickered again, and Betty began to bark.<br/><br/>He shook his head and leaned toward the mirror. Again the lights flickered, for a longer time. He began to scrape his cheek. He turned his head one way to get a better angle.<br/><br/>The face in the mirror turned the opposite direction.<br/><br/>Jimmy lowered the razor. His...reflection? stared out at him. "Hello, Jimmy," it said suddenly. "You <i>killed</i> me. That's pretty hard for a guy to get over. And don't think I didn't try!"<br/><br/>The other Jimmy began to crawl out of the mirror. He was getting paler and paler, as if drained of blood.<br/><br/>"Go away! Go away!" cried Jimmy. "It was twenty years ago! This is not happening! No! NO!"<br/><br/>"We all have a part to play, Jimmy," said the other one. "It's all one big script." Blood was staining his shirt. Jimmy looked down and saw he was bleeding now as well.<br/><br/>He ran out of the bathroom. Standing in the suite's living room was another version of himself, clean-shaven, wearing an expensive suit. He was younger looking somehow. He was wearing a wedding ring on one hand.<br/><br/>"You could have had all this," he said to Jimmy. "What's wrong with you?"<br/><br/>The pale version of him came into the room. He and the well-dressed version began to circle around Jimmy. "You can't hide!" they said. "You can\u2019t run away!"<br/><br/>Jimmy fell to the ground and covered his eyes with his forearms. "Go away, go away," he moaned as the other two began to yell, louder, louder, and louder...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Temperance was walking down the hall to her room through the flickering lights of the casino's failing power. She saw a Chinese man swatting at the air. He was wearing dark glasses and holding a white cane.<br/><br/>Charleston could only hear a high pitched hum. He felt something slimy <i>crawling</i> under the skin near his cheekbones. Something slurped its way upwards...<br/><br/>Temperance saw him claw his glasses off his face. She was shocked to see he was not just blind--he had no eyes, just empty sockets. She ran up to him. "Sir! You're going to hurt yourself worse! A lot more!"<br/><br/>Charleston felt hands on his wrists. "Go away, Anna! Go away!"<br/><br/>"Sir! I'm just a guest at the hotel..."<br/><br/>Charleston wrenched her wrist around and swept his foot behind her leg, throwing her down onto the carpet. He began crawling away. "Anna! No! I got rid of you!"<br/><br/>Temperance felt the hallway begin to swirl around her. She stumbled to her feet and ran blindly through the darkness.<br/><br/>Ahead she finally saw a dim pool of light. Standing in it was a man dressed in the clothes of a Polynesian chief. She approached in disbelief. "Charlie?" she said. "How can you be here? You're just a voice in my head..."<br/><br/>Charlie turned and gave a half-smile, the tattoos on his face moving luridly in the shadow. As she began to move toward him, he shifted and became a tongue of flame. As she got even closer, the flame shifted and became a small boy, who rapidly grew into adulthood. <br/><br/>Suddenly she realized she was walking on the palm of his hand, the palm of an enormous giant human figure. It grasped her tightly. It felt like continents crushing together.<br/><br/>The man regarded her with a face that was all too human and yet somehow alien. "Not worth our time," it said, and flung her into the darkness...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458793/#Comment_458793" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-22T05:48:30+00:00" title="December 22, 2016  5:48AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the 1894 playset.

The wedding party was winding down. Most of the guests were bussed back to California or Nevada, but some stayed; as family friends, in the case of Candace and Temperance; somewhat involuntarily in the case of Jimmy and Charleston.<br/><br/>It turns out that the governor's wife wanted to talk to some of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The worst you could say about Erica Carlyle Grey was that the years showed on her. Not in any obvious way; Carlyle money paid for the army of stylists she employed for public appearances. But there was a tiredness in her gaze, even if it could melt steel when she needed it to, as a few board members had found out when they challenged her.<br/><br/>Still; she was on the far side of sixty and could be forgiven for being a little short for weariness' sake with Jimmy.<br/><br/>"So Jimmy--is it still Jimmy? Not Jake or Jack or Jan Johannson?"<br/><br/>Jimmy shifted uncomfortably as he looked around the opulently decorated office the Governor used during his retreats to the lake. "James or Jimmy."<br/><br/>"Over the years you've caused Bradley a lot of grief. Bailed him out a few times too. I haven't said anything, because you brought my sister back. Though that was a little hard to come to terms with at first."<br/><br/>"I'd say it wasn't my <i>intention</i> to do that, but those are just words."<br/><br/>"And I know you looked after Millicent. Although I think you're also responsible for Mirabelle. So that's kind of a push." She shook her head and sipped her brandy. "Bradley has brought you back for a reason. I don't know what it is yet. But you're not allowed to run away this time, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"I just wanted to see my niece get married. I'm done with this life. It's taken everything from me."<br/><br/>"Don't take that tone with me."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry. What have you lost?"<br/><br/>"My brother."<br/><br/>"I lost my best friend, my fiancee--"<br/><br/>"She's here you know. We told her you were coming. At first she was surprised, since we'd heard you died in Burma or China...actually, Bradley had a very reliable report that you'd been killed in Kansas. I was inclined to believe it. Kansas is a good place to die."<br/><br/>"I was under a barn, and it collapsed, but the thing was--"<br/><br/>She slammed down her glass. "Ever since you came into my family's life it's been one crazy thing after another. But now <i>you're</i> family. So I expect you to start looking after my family like you did yours. I need you to help my boy. Not Frank, he's Bradley's son. Roger. Well, Van. Van Carlyle he calls himself--I convinced Bradley to let him use the Carlyle name so it doesn't die out. He's a lot like Roger--"<br/><br/>Jimmy turned pale.<br/><br/>"Not in the research department. A dreamer."<br/><br/>"I think I've earned the right to avoid my responsibilities for the rest of my life."<br/><br/>"We could all die tomorrow!"<br/><br/>"I've already died."<br/><br/>"At least hear Bradley out. And for God's sake talk to Janet! Nut up, Jimmy."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Charleston was still tending bar; he couldn't see the state policeman who was following him. He grabbed a tray of drinks and made his way to the parlor with its enormous stone hearth. It was lit; September gets cold even in Tahoe.<br/><br/>He handed out the drinks until he only had a flute of champagne left. "Who's this for?" he said politely.<br/><br/>A voice like a shriek of a violin spoke nearby. <i>Over here, Charleston</i>.<br/><br/><i>Anna Mae</i>, he thought. The tray shook in his hands. <i>You're here</i>.<br/><br/><i>Yes, Charleston. You didn't think burning down that two-bit village would chase me away, did you? I still need you. I'm like your daughter. I need you to survive. You need to feed me...or I'll feed myself.</i><br/><br/>"I'll never do it!" he said out loud. "You were a mistake. It was never supposed to turn out this way."<br/><br/><i>Just because it was a mistake doesn't mean you don't get to take responsibility for it. Or are you going to run away again?</i><br/><br/>"Yes I am!" He dropped the tray and bolted out of the room. He felt someone grab him.<br/><br/>"You ain't going anywhere," snarled the state trooper in his ear as he fastened the handcuffs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458801/#Comment_458801" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-22T18:31:07+00:00" title="December 22, 2016  6:31PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Unanswered Question: Prologue Part 4b (The Night of the Wedding, 1955)</b><br/><br/>Temperance walked into the governor's office.

And she lost her arm because she got caught up in the chaos of my life."<br/><br/>"You were in the car when she had the accident?"<br/><br/>"The <i>accident</i>...er...no, but I set her on the path to ending up...in the car."<br/><br/>"I'm assuming you're part of the secrets my parents like to try and keep from me. Although the Colonel's stories are a bit more colorful than the ones Geronimo and my mother try to keep from me..."<br/><br/>"Murphy," muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/>The door burst open and "Colonel" Ashley Murphy, late of the US Marine Corps (where he helped design landing boats) and currently head of Murphy Recreational Vehicles and Trailers, Ltd. (Ask about an upgrade to the Commodore model!) stepped in. "Ah, darling, there you are!" he said in his trademark staccato style. "Jimmy! I hear you're a wandering bum. I could put you in a motor home!"<br/><br/>"Hello father," said Temperance.<br/><br/>"Murphy," muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You don't get to call me 'Murphy', old man! It's Ashley! Or Colonel."<br/><br/>"Murphy."<br/><br/>"Same old Jimmy!" He shot a glance at Temperance. "I never said he wasn't <i>real</i>..."<br/><br/>"I got the impression that he <i>wasn't</i>. I mean, anytime someone mentions the komodo dragons somebody starts weeping. I thought it was a joke..."<br/><br/>"Well you're in the middle of something," said Murphy, backing away from them like they were Omaha Beach.<br/><br/>"I should go too," said Jimmy. "Thanks for the...conversations. Have a pleasant evening. Come on, Betty."<br/><br/>The basset hound moaned at him.<br/><br/>"You can sit in front of the fire." He slowly made his way out of the office. Erica buried her face in her hands. "You wanted something?" she said at last to Temperance.<br/><br/>"Just wondering if you'd found my earring...oh, there it is," she said and beat a hasty retreat.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Candace sat in front of the fire, sipping her whiskey. She remembered another time, sitting in front of a fire with her husband, talking about visiting California, going to results...<br/><br/>And here she was: alone. It seemed to call for a toast. She knocked back another gulp of her drink.<br/><br/>It had been two years since she had written her first novel...well, first <i>literary</i> novel; she'd published a couple of her mysteries in the meantime. (She usually banged out several a year, when she didn't have more difficult work.) So far, while she'd been able to write, nothing had jelled; her "serious" work was unfocused, lackluster. It didn't have that spark that separated the quick from the dead. <br/><br/>If Andrew was still here, he'd help her work through it; she just knew he would. But he wasn't, and she felt alone and tired. <br/><br/>She wanted to go home. To talk to Vlad, who always helped her work through her rough patches. She wanted to get back to her work.<br/><br/>She finished her drink and stared for one long moment out at the moonlight lake. Then she went to bed.<br/><br/>Everything would change the next morning...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458808/#Comment_458808" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-23T01:31:07+00:00" title="December 23, 2016  1:31AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(I like Manet better than Monet.

He was lying on a couch in the sitting room of the Grey's lodge in Lake Tahoe. From another room he heard the sound of someone playing piano--something Baroque, maybe Bach.<br/><br/>He stretched and stood up, then grabbed his white cane and tapped his way into the room the music was coming from. As he stood in the doorway, it abruptly stopped.<br/><br/>"Excuse me. Didn't see you there," said a man's voice. He sounded young.<br/><br/>"I didn't see you either."<br/><br/>"Oh," said the man. "Right. Sorry, man."<br/><br/>"It's okay."<br/><br/>"I didn't think anyone else was up."<br/><br/>"What time is it, anyway?"<br/><br/>"About seven."<br/><br/>"In the morning?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. I wouldn't have played if I had known anyone was listening."<br/><br/>"It's all right, just proof that I'm alive," chuckled Charleston. "Are you just an early riser, or is this the end of your night?"<br/><br/>"Kinda the end. Just going the with the flow." Charleston felt the man take his hand and shake it. "Roger Grey, but call me Van. Van Carlyle."<br/><br/>"Charleston Chiu, but call me Charles."<br/><br/>"Charleston Chiu? Interesting name, friend. Probably take a lot of guff about it."<br/><br/>"Only from my friends. I guess we're friends now."<br/><br/>"Far out. Like music, friend?"<br/><br/>"I love it. I used to fool around with a violin...but not so much now. The piano sounded lovely."<br/><br/>"Thanks. That Gould kid has been running with that piece...I dunno, learned it when I was a kid. Bach. Goldberg variations. But I like modern music, Thelonious, cats like that."<br/><br/>"Keen man, you're hip!"<br/><br/>"Trying to be, trying to be. Hey, you're that cat the deputies were hanging around. I think my dad wanted you to meet him."<br/><br/>"Let's go get some coffee and then see the Governor."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy woke up in his guest room and got up quietly. He cracked the door and Betty ran out, snuffling. A servant gently tapped and handed him some coffee.<br/><br/>He finished getting dressed and then took the cup with him out onto the deck that wrapped around the second story of the lodge. Sitting at a redwood table at one corner of the house was a woman. She had dark black hair with just a few hints of grey. She was smoking and looking out over the lake. As he approached she turned to face him.<br/><br/>"Oh my god," said Janet Rogers. "It's..."<br/><br/>"Janet," said Jimmy. "Hello."<br/><br/>"I heard you dead. In Burma, and New Guinea, and--"<br/><br/>"Kansas?"<br/><br/>"No, Bohemia."<br/><br/>"Turns out being dead tends to solve a lot of problems...temporarily."<br/><br/>"I won't say you're looking good," said Janet with a wry grin. "And you always were a keen judge of your own character. Have you read any of my books? I based Willie St. James on you, don't know if you noticed."<br/><br/>"I plead ignorance."<br/><br/>"It's been thirteen years."<br/><br/>"Has it? Feels like fifty."<br/><br/>"Listen, I'm...sorry about what I said. Thirteen years ago."<br/><br/>"Drinks were flowing, emotions were high."<br/><br/>"I hope you could look back...I hope you didn't hate me, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"I could never hate you."<br/><br/>"I hated you. About five, seven years. Then the war came, and things didn't seem to matter so much."<br/><br/>They fell silent and let the wind playing over the lake wash over them.<br/><br/>"I think Bradley has something for you," said Janet finally.<br/><br/>"Pretty sure he has eyes on me 24/7," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"If there was anything I needed to worry about, you'd tell me, right?"<br/><br/>"Cross my heart."<br/><br/>"You always were a damn poor liar."<br/><br/>"Guess it's just one of my charms. We should talk again."<br/><br/>"Sure give me your number...oh, right."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Temperance was sitting in the dining room. It was cleanly and expensively furnished, with spotless linen tablecloths spread over the little cabaret and larger trestle tables. She was looking at the paintings that had been strung around the room. The Rembrandt was obviously a fake, she thought.<br/><br/>Governor Bradley Grey came into the room and sat across from her at one of the larger tables. "Like that? Genuine Rembrandt. Erica got in England after the war."<br/><br/>"I hope you didn't pay too much for it...er...I mean, Rembrandts..."<br/><br/>"We'll donate it to the state at the end of my term."<br/><br/>"How are you this morning, Governor?"<br/><br/>"I invited Jimmy Wright to a wedding," he said slowly, as if the words caused him pain. "You know he used to work for me...then I think I worked for him."<br/><br/>"I don't understand."<br/><br/>"I had to do a lot of favors for him, and your mother and stepfather...and your stepmother and father..."<br/><br/>"How generous. If I may say, you don't look like you've had much sleep."<br/><br/>Grey sighed. "I'm not a young man anymore. I became governor because it\u2019s time to think about my legacy--I'll do my eight years in office and put my stamp on California, before they elect some damn fool actor or something ridiculous like that. Plus I couldn't say in Congress after they started electing pricks like Dick Nixon to the senate! You know what it was like sitting with that guy in the cloakroom? And McCarthy, what a clown."<br/><br/>"I try to stay away from politics."<br/><br/>"You a Republican?"<br/><br/>"I'm a Catholic."<br/><br/>"So a Democrat. Where do you live now?"<br/><br/>"New York."<br/><br/>"I used to live there. I liked it, but Erica wanted to come out here." He fell silent for a while. "Temperance, I asked you here for a reason. You were in Las Vegas a couple of years ago, right? Something happened, didn't it?"<br/><br/>Temperance blanched. "The sandstorm..."<br/><br/>"There's someone I want you to meet.

She took her plate into one of the front rooms. It was on the east side of the house, and brilliant sunshine filled the room. Sitting at the table was a blonde woman in her mid-thirties; she was wearing tortoiseshell glasses and had a troubled look on her face. Across from her was a skinny, excited man in wire-rim glasses, slurping up coffee. They were talking animatedly.<br/><br/>"--They'll be getting everyone together soon, Sam, and then we can tell them about Percy," said the woman. "Oh, hello."<br/><br/>"Hello," said Candace.<br/><br/>"You're Candace Heartbrooke, aren't you? The professor?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I teach literature at Wellesley."<br/><br/>"Where are my manners. Lisa Schicksal."<br/><br/>"Candace Heartbrooke."<br/><br/>"Yes, we established that. This is my colleague--" she turned to the man. "Do you prefer Sam or Samuel?"<br/><br/>"Doctor."<br/><br/>"Doctor Sam Acererak."<br/><br/>Candace sat down next to them. "How do you know the family?"<br/><br/>"To tell the truth, I don't know them that well. But an odd thing happened to me a few years ago, and I think my husband Percival may have been involved...actually, let's just all get together."<br/><br/>"That would be for the best," said Sam.<br/><br/>A short while later Temperance, Candace, Charleston and Jimmy were gathered in the governor's office. Bradley Grey was sitting behind his desk; sitting on chairs next to him were Lisa and Sam. "Everyone, this is Dr. Schicksal and her colleague. You were all in Vegas two years ago. She was too. I really want you to listen to what she has to say...you seem to be the right person by temperament or happenstance to help her out. Even you, Chuckles."<br/><br/>Lisa stood up. "My name is Lisa Schicksal. Ph.D., if you want to make a big deal out of it. I studied anthropology. I met my husband Percival in England during the war--I was doing translation and he was studying the V-2 rockets. He's a physicist...well, maybe a bit more. Percy was into a lot of...interesting stuff. The occult. Alistair Crowley stuff."<br/><br/>Candace busily took some notes.<br/><br/>"I haven't seen Percy in several years...I guess I have to be honest about everything," Lisa said to Sam.<br/><br/>"That would be best."<br/><br/>"Percy's interests extended beyond occult research. He believed in free love, and I tried to be open-minded...but I couldn't, and some of the people that tracked into our house in California...Anyway, I took a job back East. We were still friends, maybe even in love a bit. The last I heard, he was starting some multi-disciplinary think tank in Nevada. The corporation that fronted him found some ex-government space--"<br/><br/>"The last you heard?" said Charleston.<br/><br/>"Well, he started to get into some hush hush stuff around '52. I would get the occasional phone call. Then that stopped. So I headed out to Vegas to see if I could shake up the brass and get back in touch with him...and then that night happened. And some very strange things...and I don't know, but maybe...Percy had something to do with it. He saw...things...sometimes. He and his friends...did things. Things that worked...I try to keep an open mind but I'm still a scientist."<br/><br/>"Science doesn't explain everything," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"So you're looking for Percy?" said Charleston.<br/><br/>"I found where the place he was working was located. It's closed down and on private land, so we can just go there."<br/><br/>"Let me ask a little more clearly. Do you want to find him, or his group?"<br/><br/>"I want to find out what he was working on. If he was doing something dangerous--"<br/><br/>"So your romantic relations aren't important."<br/><br/>"I don't think we're that close anymore."<br/><br/>"I knew Percy," said Sam. "And whatever he's working on, it's important."<br/><br/>"I know you all saw something in Vegas," said Lisa. "I sent out a lot of questionnaires, and the governor was helpful--"<br/><br/>Jimmy glared at Bradley. "You know what this is?" said the governor hotly. "This is you being jealous because normally it's ME doing this kind of favor for YOU. Now I'm doing it to you. How's it feel?"<br/><br/>"This is all fascinating!" said Candace. "A mystery gets my blood flowing! But what are we doing here? Why not the police?"<br/><br/>"The police and the government can't help us," said Lisa. Jimmy nodded vigorously. "And you were there in '53."<br/><br/>"What were they working on anyway?" asked Charleston. "Wasn't your husband a rocket scientist?"<br/><br/>"They were working in psychology. Percy wanted to bring disciplines together--artists, writers, social scientists...because if you only allow physicists to make things, they'll be things only physicists understand, and likewise artists...so he wanted to give them a space to be together." She gulped. "And, well, the government wanted him to do some <i>directed psychology</i>."<br/><br/>"Brainwashing?" said Candace.<br/><br/>"I don't want to put a label on it."<br/><br/>"Damnit," said Charleston. "Not again. I've been known to dabble in this kind of thing. Usually with disastrous results."<br/><br/>"It's true," said Jimmy. "About the disasters."<br/><br/>"Well, who better than people who have been burned?" said Lisa. "And I know you all saw things. And that you have to wonder about what that was."<br/><br/>"I don't," said Jimmy. "I've learned it\u2019s better that way."<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458860/#Comment_458860" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-28T23:20:25+00:00" title="December 28, 2016 11:20PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little confused -- the write up starts in 1955, not 1953, correct?

She was really mad when she wrote it.]</i><br/><br/>"Yeah."<br/><br/>"Is this kind of thing what broke my mother?"<br/><br/>"If she hasn't told you about what we did, it's not my place to tell you."<br/><br/>"What is to be expected by helping you?"<br/><br/>"Insanity."<br/><br/><i>[Me: But was it worth it?</i><br/><i>JP: NO! Well, maybe saving the world...</i><br/><i>Me: OH! SAVING THE WORLD! ]</i><br/><br/>"The things that we saw in Las Vegas, that's what we can expect?"<br/><br/>"Every endeavor is different. I don't know what we're going to come up against. But whatever it is, it's not going to be pretty. It will most likely break you. It will destroy you, it will kill you, and then spit you out again as a mangled shadow of what you were."<br/><br/><i>[Me: Not everybody is as bad off as Jimmy. Freddy came out of it just fine!</i><br/><i>CP: Freddy came out of the box broken.]</i><br/><br/>Temperance blinked.<br/><br/>"It is a decision that you have to make yourself," said Jimmy. "But once you start, there's no turning back."<br/><br/>"Fine. Two conditions. One, be honest with me from now on. And when I ask you a straight question, I expect a straight answer. None of this iffy-piffy 'don't we all' nonsense. Understood? Good. Two, I'm not a huge fan of dogs. Make sure it doesn't touch any of my things."<br/><br/>From the house came a mournful howl. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"Before we go," said Jimmy to Governor Grey, "Does this have anything to do with Van?"<br/><br/>The governor poured himself another drink. "You know how many years of piano lessons and tutors I paid for that kid? Then he has a 'breakdown' and drops out of conservatory. Next I hear he's bumming around Europe."<br/><br/>Jimmy shrugged. "Something similar happened to me and I turned out fine."<br/><br/>"I don't know about fine. Doesn't have a job. Doesn't perform. I don't know...he's a good kid...you know, Erica insisted he use the Carlyle name. Can't say it didn't hurt; he's my son, he should have my name. But...he's a Carlyle, not a Grey. Maybe that's good. They're richer than the Rockefellers."<br/><br/>He sighed. "Look, the kid may be in trouble."<br/><br/>"Did it have to do with Vegas?"<br/><br/>"I don't know. He's spacey. He's an artist...I don't know, Jimmy. Something's up. You can feel it. McCarthy, all these JDs running around knifing old ladies, and the Reds...something's in the air. And it's not just the war."<br/><br/>"I think the whole world is trying to figure out what it's going to do with itself."<br/><br/>"I think it's more than that. I know you don't want to get back in this game, but who can I turn to? Francis? He's working for the government, won't give me the time of day. Freddy? He's a broken reed. The only two people left are you and that nutcase."<br/><br/>"To be fair, he seems a bit more sane. I'd kind of thought he'd died."<br/><br/>"Look, Sam and Lisa did extensive psych profiles on everyone they could find out. Temperance and Candace came up very high. Don't know why; maybe it's the artistic temperament, in Candace's case."<br/><br/>"And Temperance has her parents."<br/><br/>"Tell me about it. You know Colonel Murphy sold me a motorhome last night?"<br/><br/>"You <i>bought</i> it?"<br/><br/>"It seemed like a good deal! Maybe I can give it to Van, he can live in it. Just...take him with you and keep an eye on him."<br/><br/>Jimmy nodded and turned to go. "Something odd," said the governor as Jimmy started to open the door. "When your name was mentioned, Lisa didn't seem surprised somehow." <br/><br/><br/><br/>They flew to Las Vegas that evening. And that night, in their hotel, they all had terrible dreams.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sam went back to his time in Operation Paperclip. He and Percival were sitting in the PX, talking about the dream world Sam had found himself in--the ancient cities of Dylanth-Keen, the forest of Shar and its gugs and zooks, Hlanith and unattainable Kadath. He was about to explain to Percy how he escaped when he realized that Percival had vanished. Instead he was beholding a hooded, masked form, who towered against the cold stars, blacker than night, the tattered flaps of its robes hissing in the wind...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Temperance was in a  tropical valley. The sea breezes whipped through the haggard, withered trees, and the vegetation seemed somehow angry. Far down the blasted valley she saw a pinprick of white light. As she took a step forward and heard a horrific noise.<br/><br/>She turned to run and saw Charlie, his face an impassive mask. "He comes," he said, and stabbed her in the chest with his kukri.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Candace dreamed she was at her writing desk, surrounded by notes and reams of typing paper. She was writing swiftly in a journal, but as she looked at the lines on the page, they seemed like gibberish. Still she kept writing, asking herself "what is the story? What is the plot?"<br/><br/>She finally stopped writing. The words seemed to be in some foreign language. As she tried to sound them out, her dead husband appeared in front of her, wearing a porcelain mask that covered his entire face. He began to read the words with her. They pushed forward. She was unable to stop. Her husband's voice got louder and louder until it was deafening. She cowered in pain and suddenly there was a deafening crack, and she woke with a start.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy dreamed he was walking down the street in a pleasant, ordinary American small town. A stranger walked up to him. He was wearing a Mardi Gras mask, but this didn't seem to bother him or Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, I need your help," he said.<br/><br/>Jimmy nodded. "All right--"<br/><br/>A woman walked up. "I need your help too."<br/><br/>"Okay--"<br/><br/>More people showed up, all demanding help. He saw people he knew--Temperance, Bradley Grey, Van Carlyle--all surrounding him. The crowd began to press in on him. He struggled through them, trying to escape. As he was pressed into the side of a building, he saw an axe leaning against the wall.<br/><br/>He grabbed it and began chopping away at the people around him with gleeful abandon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458910/#Comment_458910" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-30T18:05:43+00:00" title="December 30, 2016  6:05PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Sorry to be responding so slowly, but I just got to the Fiasco stuff - it's wonderful, thanks!

But, you also get to play out the backstory, which is fun. And things will change because of the playset -- while we never went into great depth with it, the Millicent-Dr. Orange relationship made a lot of things crystallize for me -- Millicent as the Mad Scientist's assistant and as translator between folks even more out there on the lack-of-social-graces spectrum and relatively ordinary people.<br/><br/>As a GM, you want enough of a focus so this set up goes places -- but you don't want to be so focused you'll be disappointed when whatever plans you have (or realize you sort of had) do not survive the first scene. With Dracula Dossier, before we even started playing, my idea of a Lucy Westenra type for my PC-for-the-game and the focus of the 1894 leg went way, way out the window and turned into a brilliant but untrustworthy con man type who was capable of debating different properties of soil and dyes while trying to sell fake Manets. And this was before we even get to bulls charging PCs at Buffalo Bill's circus, Buffalo Bill threatening to sic Annie Oakley on a PC, and the PC creating a bomb just to scare him -- and getting invited to join the circus as a result. It created a normal (if farcial) baseline before all the supernatural stuff started happening.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458959/#Comment_458959" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-02T17:07:59+00:00" title="January  2, 2017  5:07PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: A Crack In Everything (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Charleston dreamed he stood on the shores of a great lake. Waves of fog rolled in towards him. In the mist ahead, he saw a woman, elegantly dressed in some vaguely medieval way. She turned to face him and with a start he realized it was his long-dead assistant, Noor, arrayed as a queen.<br/><br/>"I must be dreaming," he said, "because if I wasn't dreaming I couldn't see you."<br/><br/>"Hello Charleston."<br/><br/>"Sorry about the whole inside-out thing..."<br/><br/>"I've been dead for almost thirty years.

Charleston was turning something over in his head: he had just remembered that Percival Schicksal had some connections to a man named Nathan Quincy Lund, author of <i>Diametrically Opposed Analysis: The New Science of the Soul</i> and the organization that spread its precepts, Neurotology. He remembered Schicksal and Lund had lived together for a while in California. Supposedly they had been both involved in performing magical--excuse me, <i>magickal</i>--rituals of the Crowleyite kind.<br/><br/><i>[CP: Okay, so I know that if something happened it was most likely they inverted themselves or something.</i><br/><i>Me: Sure, turned inside out, who knows?

They pulled up at the pumps and a dusty man in coveralls came out of the small storefront. "Howdy folks, Clare Medford. How can I help you? Need gas? We got tacos, Hershey bars, bathroom out back..."<br/><br/>"We do need gas," said Sam, getting out of their rented Caddy.<br/><br/>"You came to the Gas 'n Go. You can get gas, then go."<br/><br/>"I was also looking for someone who may live around here--my friend Percival."<br/><br/>"Can't say the name strikes a bell. Unless he was one of them government fellows? There used to be a place up the road a piece, but they ain't there no more."<br/><br/>"Anybody hanging around the place?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Well," said Clare, removing his hat to scratch his head, "It's on the old Jennings ranch. Government took it from him back in '43. After they were done, they leased it back to him. He lives up there in one of them Murphy trailers. Government pays him to keep an eye on the complex for them."<br/><br/>"Does he ever come around with stories of strange things happening?"<br/><br/>"Not that I've noticed. He comes down about once a month to get supplies. Got an artesian well up there."<br/><br/>"Can I get a taco?"<br/><br/>"Sure. Green chili or red?"<br/><br/>"It's for the dog."<br/><br/>"Oh. Y'all headed up that way?"<br/><br/>"Maybe," said Sam.<br/><br/>"Well, good luck. Hope your car can navigate it. Harold uses a jeep when he comes down."<br/><br/><br/><br/>They left Clare and drove up through the Nevada desert. Scrub plants covered the sandy plain. The road was little more than a dirt track over the ridgelines, but it was dry now and they didn't encounter any areas they couldn't navigate.<br/><br/><i>[JP: Let me know when we get the flat tire.</i><br/><i>Me: Okay, I'm going to have to ask you to make two pulls from the tower.]</i><br/><br/>Eventually they saw, shining like the evening star, the aluminum siding of the Commodore-style trailer that must be Mr. Jennings' home. Beyond that they could see a chain link fence surrounding a couple of industrial style buildings: a cinderblock garage big enough to house a few trucks, and a single story office building of some kind; a cinderblock tower, probably a water tower of some kind, loomed over the far end.<br/><br/>They pulled up in front of the trailer. Jennings was sitting under an awning, drinking a Lone Star beer. He ambled up to them, grabbing the shotgun that was leaning against the trailer as he did.<br/><br/>"We're not thieves," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Didn't say you were," said Jennings. "Don't take names that don't belong to you."<br/><br/>"You have a shotgun."<br/><br/>"Yup. I live out here. What y'all doing?"<br/><br/>"My apologies for coming unannounced," said Temperance.<br/><br/>"Not like you could call, I ain't got no phone."<br/><br/>"We are looking for someone who went missing. A friend of a friend, Percival Schicksal." For the first time, she reflected on the meaning of <i>Schicksal </i>in German: <i>fate</i>.<br/><br/>"Ain't been anyone here since '53. Don't know what they were doing up here. Some shrinks in a think tank."<br/><br/>"We think he was working up there. Could we have a look?"<br/><br/>"Don't see why not."<br/><br/>"Can we bring the dog?"<br/><br/>"Hell, lady, not my land; government just pays me to keep an eye on it. You ain't thieves. You're friend told me that."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458990/#Comment_458990" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-04T16:31:19+00:00" title="January  4, 2017  4:31PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2017 4:40PM by Aviatrix.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: A Crack In Everything (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>Jennings walked them up to the gate, which was just a section of the fence on wheels that could roll back. There was a small gatehouse there. They walked through and looked at the shabby building in front of them. Sand had drifted up against the walls.<br/><br/>It looked like any number of anonymous government buildings that the War Department had built: a low quadrangle with dust-covered windows. They pushed the glass doors of the entrance open and walked into the reception room.<br/><br/>Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust and grit. The walls had been stripped bare, and the room had the dismal look of a failed company after the movers have come and gone. Temperance found a few yellowed glossy pamphlets on one deck, describing the "Hali Institute" and its programs. Sam glanced at it, sniffed, and moved past the desk into the rows of offices beyond.<br/><br/>"Just propaganda," he muttered. "Sales pitch."<br/><br/>Temperance picked up the pamphlet Sam had dropped. "The Hali Institute", she read. It was pretty anodyne; praising the new personality tests and memory improvement techniques the Institute was pioneering. "The fantastic new chemicals will unlock the hidden potential of the human mind!"<br/><br/>They followed Sam through the office complex. Jimmy halted in front of one of the offices in the back. <br/><br/>"D12," he read. "Director Schicksal."<br/><br/>Temperance and Candace went inside. Like everything else, the office had been thoroughly and professionally stripped. However there were boxes stacked against one wall, with labels that looked very much like some kind of government filing system, although there was nothing to indicate which agency they belonged to.<br/><br/>Candace opened several boxes and went through their contents; mostly books and filing records. She found a largish water color that resembled, vaguely, one of the cards of the Major Arcana in the Tarot. At the bottom is was labeled "#0: Le Mat," which she knew was the French name for the card called The Fool in English. The imagery, however, was bizarrely altered; instead of stepping off a cliff, a figure in a long, hooded robe and wearing a bone-white, almost featureless mask stood on the edge of the cliff. Behind him a mushroom cloud was blooming, casting a sickly yellow light on everything. The masked figure had a dog standing next to him; it cast its gaze back along the winding road that had led them here, where in the far distance a tiny figure in yellow was approaching.<br/><br/>It was signed "Amadou Lalin". Candace knew the name, vaguely; a young avant garde artist in the New York demimonde.<br/><br/><i>[Occult for the imagery of the picture, and a one-point Art History spend to know Lalin (I also would have accepted Counterculture.)]</i><br/><br/>Temperance found a 1953 date planner. Most of the dates were blocked off through the year; but she noticed several blocks crossed out and written in again around the dates of 17, 18, and 19 June--coinciding with the movement of the date of the Rosenbergs' execution...and the strange night they had experienced in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Candace found a sealed note. She opened it. "P, I cannot stay. If I could pray, I would pray for you. Love, A."<br/><br/>Temperance dug out a photograph of some men; one was Schicksal, and the other was of a man in a tweed jacket. There was also a note from an S. Molinari to Director Schicksal in 1952, requesting time off to visit Israel. A note was penciled on the page: "When did you start getting religion? --P"; below that was a reply:<br/><br/>"When you started playing God. --Sol."<br/><br/>There was also an unplayed copy of Walter Winston's Cello Concerto <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> "For Erich Z."<br/><br/><i>[In my run of </i>Eternal Lies<i>, Walter Winston was a composer; that concerto is dedicated to Erich Zann, whom he met in Geneva.</i><br/><br/>Candace dug into another box. There was a typed report about "Binary Stars in Taurus" by Dr. Carl Simon. A watercolor of some desert flowers signed by a Juliet. And two signed copies of <i>Diametrically Opposed Analysis: The New Science of the Soul</i>, by N. Quincy Lund. She pocketed one of them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459033/#Comment_459033" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-06T00:56:01+00:00" title="January  6, 2017 12:56AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2017 12:57AM by Aviatrix.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: A Crack In Everything (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy and Charleston followed Sam through the rest of the offices; they all showed signs of having been professionally searched and, well, <i>cleaned</i>, as in <i>cleaned out.</i> Beyond the end of the offices they found a large cafeteria.<br/><br/>"This is way too big for the number people we saw," said Jimmy. Charleston shrugged and tapped the ground with his cane. Sam was already opening a door on the opposite wall. Beyond it was the facility's physical plant: a boiler, tool racks, ducting leading up to the ceiling.<br/><br/>Jimmy pointed an old oil tank out to Sam. "That was moved; see how it was taken down from the wall over there? Looks like it got dragged over that area."<br/><br/>"Why would somebody do that?" muttered Sam.<br/><br/>"I think because it was heavy. There's got to be something under it."<br/><br/>Temperance and Candace arrived in time to help push the oil tank away from the wall. Under it was a pair of stamped metal doors. Judging by the hollow noise they made when Jimmy kicked them, there was some kind of deep shaft below them.<br/><br/>"Be right back he said," and began to trace some wiring conduits. In one corner of a room he found a console that someone had smashed up. Using his penknife he spliced together some wires and then pressed a green button.<br/><br/>From the bottom of the shaft, an elevator platform rose up. Jimmy rejoined the rest. "Shall we?" he said.<br/><br/>They rode the elevator about twenty feet down. They came to a large chamber, walled with cinderblock, that smacked of U.S. Army construction from the war. Lights flickered overhead, illuminating a dusty space.<br/><br/>Charleston sniffed and felt around on the ground, and then drifted over to the wall. "There was as struggle here," he said. "Bullet holes in the wall. From military rifles." He felt the ground. "Something was dragged here. Bodies, I think."<br/><br/>Candace was staring at an unusual symbol that had been painted in yellow on the wall. It resembled some kind of Chinese character, although at the same time it didn't look Chinese in the slightest. It had been scratched out in places. Someone had spray painted "DON'T LOOK!" over it in red, obscuring some of the symbol.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/146995/assets/678582/YSGRaffiti2.png?1482510407"/><br/><br/>There were other writings in different hands around it. "HE COMES" read one. "WOE TO YOU WHO CRO" started another before breaking off.<br/><br/>Sam was already pushing through the room's single exit. There were several rooms in a warren of narrow corridors. Almost all of them were chemical laboratories of some kind. He pushed into one and began looking around. "LSD, LSD-25...mescaline...I don't know what that is..." All of the drugs were unusual...and all were powerful psychotropics.<br/><br/>The rest of them spent some time exploring the complex. Charleston began to hear things. Not strange things--the sound of people chatting or asking women for cups of coffee; the perfectly ordinary sounds of workplace communication.<br/><br/>The thing was he couldn't sense that anyone was <i>there</i>. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459044/#Comment_459044" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-06T16:22:56+00:00" title="January  6, 2017  4:22PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: A Crack In Everything (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>Sam flipped angrily through notebooks, throwing them on the ground. "Ridiculous...useless...I know about these...what's this?"<br/><br/>He began to read. Compound N: a highly addictive, non-synthesizable drug. It was listed as locked in a safe. He raced to that corner of the room and pulled open the cabinet to reveal a weathered old safe.<br/><br/>He heard the sound of whistling behind him. He glanced up a man in a white lab coat who sauntered in and looked around the room. "Damnit, I told them to clean this room up."<br/><br/>"Are you real?" said Sam?<br/><br/>"Somebody say something?" the man said, glancing around. He shuddered. "This place gives me the creeps." He walked out.<br/><br/>"I hate when that happens," muttered Sam.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Temperance walked into a lab room and stopped. "Guys...I think you want to look at this." Charleston and Candace gathered behind her and stared at one corner of the room.<br/><br/>In it a ten foot high effigy of some kind had been built, mounted on stacked tables and chairs. The frame was built of desert trees and broomsticks taped and nailed together. Several white sheets hung from the framework like robes; the edges were scalloped and tattered, although it was impossible to say if they had rotted into that condition or been deliberately made that way; they had faded to an ugly pale tannish yellow, as if they had been discolored by the sun. The middle of the sheets had been defaced by cutting out a large section; there were some traces of yellow paint around the cut, as if some symbol had been drawn there. Hanging off the top of the thing was a Punch mask.<br/><br/>Charleston kept glancing into the hallway. Somewhere he could faintly hear the sound of panting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy had noticed, unsurprisingly, that all the rooms in the complex had microphone pickups. He traced the conduits on the ceiling to a room in the northeast corner of the underground space. Banks of electronic equipment filled the room; the machinery was on but the circuits had been pulled so that most of the microphones weren't live. He found a tape still in one machine; he spooled it back a little and listened to the recording.<br/><br/>It seemed to have picked up something in one of the conference rooms; he could tell from glancing around the decks that the place had been wired so that the mikes came on when they picked up a loud enough noise.<br/><br/><i>[Telecommunications use by JP.]</i><br/><br/>There was the clomping sound of booted feet walking into the room. He heard a voice talking; it sounded like one side of a radio conversation. "Yes ma'am," the voice said. "We're moving out now."<br/><br/>"Hey sarge, what was that?" said another voice.<br/><br/>"Shut up everyone!" For a long moment there was silence. "See it was...WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!"<br/><br/>There was the sound of gunfire, then a heavy crash like a side of beef being thrown at a wall. The tape spooled out shortly after.<br/><br/>He rewound the tape and pocketed it. He looked around and saw a film cannister sitting on top of a filing cabinet--a reel from a 35 mm motion picture. He opened it up and held the film to the light. He recognized it--this was the same crazy show that had come on the television in the hotel in Las Vegas, back in '53. <br/><br/>The cannister was labeled <i>The Unanswered Question, or the Stranger and the Queen</i>. <br/><br/>Just then he heard Temperance calling and slipped out the room to find her.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, would you know what this is about?" demanded Temperance when he entered the room.<br/><br/>"Holy shit," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Do you recognize this...symbol? Do you know why a government funded group of artists and scientists would create something this..."<br/><br/>"Let's start a little smaller," said Charleston. "How does a facility like this go from making funtime happy drugs to...this..."<br/><br/>Sam came in, visibly frustrated, and stopped dead. Whatever the effigy was, it looked somehow familiar to him. "That's...that's..." He glanced away.<br/><br/>Standing in the doorway was Percival Schicksal. He saw Sam looking at him and loped off into the darkness.<br/><br/>Sam took off after him.<br/><br/>"Did anyone find any books?" continued Charleston.<br/><br/>"The doctor just left," said Candace, who had only seen Sam run out the door.<br/><br/>Jimmy groaned and stalked off into the corridor.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459119/#Comment_459119" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-09T15:21:21+00:00" title="January  9, 2017  3:21PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: A Crack In Everything (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>Sam flicked on his flashlight and ran through the shadowy hallways. He could see Percy limping stiffly up ahead, although he moved quite quickly despite the jerky movement of his legs.<br/><br/>"Percy!" shouted Sam. The figure stopped.<br/><br/>"Sam?" he said heavily, panting. Slowly he turned around.<br/><br/>Sam gasped. Percival's face was a frozen mask of ecstatic horror; if it was possible to torture a man to madness and death by giving him an orgasm, that is what it would look like. His skin was desiccated and dried.<br/><br/>"What are you doing here, Sam?" said Percy.<br/><br/>"Looking for you. I guess you found something?"<br/><br/>"Yes. Would you like me to show you?"<br/><br/>"Yes!"<br/><br/><i>[Me: SP, make a Health test against a TN of 5.</i><br/><i>SP: If I make it by four, good things happen, right?</i><br/><i>Me: Yup.</i><br/><i>JP: Be careful spending--it's still your hit points.</i><br/><i>SP: I spend five.</i><br/><i>TP: You're the new Ruby.]</i><br/><br/>Percy reached out and grabbed him by the arm. Sam had visions of ecstasy flood through his consciousness. Bliss! Greater than anything he had ever known, even in the Dream. But there was horror...because he knew he would never recapture this feeling, and it would haunt him the rest of his life. <br/><br/>"Let me share my joy with you," said Percy.<br/><br/>Sam fell to his knees and cried out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy tore up the corridor, the beam of his flashlight bobbing up and down. Behind him ran Candace and Temperance; Charleston was holding tightly to her hand.<br/><br/>In the pool of light of his flashlight, Jimmy saw a figure clutching the hand of Sam, who was on his knees in front of him. The figure looked up...<br/><br/>...and Charleston <i>saw</i> it. For the first time in a long time his third eye opened and he could see the mystic force of the creature in front of him.<br/><br/>"Hello, Percy," he said with sang froid. "I've heard your work sucked."<br/><br/>"I don't have to worry about you," panted Schicksal. "You're already like me. You will <i>be</i> like me...soon enough."<br/><br/>"Sam, should we leave?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You can't leave," said Percy.<br/><br/>"We should stay," said Sam. "This place is a miracle."<br/><br/>"Is this normal?" said Temperance.<br/><br/>"Enh..." began Jimmy.<br/><br/>"This is actually pretty standard," said Charleston.<br/><br/>"I think we should leave," said Candace. \u201cNow.\u201d<br/><br/>"You cannot leave," said Percy.<br/><br/>"Does anyone have a gun?" shouted Jimmy.<br/><br/>"What?" said Temperance.<br/><br/>"Why wouldn't you have a gun?" said Sam, touching the pistol he had under his coat.<br/><br/>Jimmy pushed forward and yanked Sam to his feet. "Come on, we're going."<br/><br/>"No!" said Sam. Percy reached out with a gangly arm and smacked Jimmy hard on the face.<br/><br/>Visions flooded into his mind...horrifying ecstasy. A moment where everything worked out right. Janet and Betty were happy. Everyone was safe. He dropped to his knees, weeping at the horror that haunted his days.<br/><br/>Charleston ran up and took a flying leap at Percy. It had been a long time since he had used his techniques, kept sharp through Tai Chi, on a living target; but his reflexes were still sharp. He slammed a kick into Percy's chest, throwing him off of Jimmy. He felt a rib give, but he also felt how hard and leathery Percy's skin had become.<br/><br/>Percy growled and grabbed Charleston, throwing him to the ground. Visions flooded into his mind...visions of temptation, of all the ways he could have used his sorcery to keep his power, his body intact, his life in order...he fell to the ground shuddering.<br/><br/><i>[CP failed the TN 5 Health check and was Shaken.]</i><br/><br/>"Percy how did you do this?" said Sam.<br/><br/>"I made a Promise."<br/><br/>"How did you contact them to make the promise? You must tell me!"<br/><br/>Temperance ran up and grabbed Sam in a headlock the Colonel had demonstrated on her many times. She dragged his protesting body down the corridor. Candace sprinted after, followed by Jimmy, who tugged Charleston along. <br/><br/>They ran together--well, all except Sam, who protested and whined the whole time--through a large, empty space. They gasped as they ran--the room was full of bodies, bodies who had suffered terrible violence, gunshots, broken limbs...some in lab coats, some in uniforms. Some had been shot in the head.<br/><br/>Just past that room they entered the water tower. Jimmy and Charleston shoved the protesting Sam between them as they clattered up the spiral staircase just behind the women. When she pulled level with the ground, Temperance gave an access door two or three swift kicks until it snapped open. Sand spilled through the doorframe and cascaded softly to the ground. The sunlight was blinding after so long in the dark.<br/><br/>Below them, standing in a square of light thrown by the doorway, they saw Percy.

Charleston banged the door shut behind them. Jimmy jackknifed over and wheezed. "I'm too old for this."<br/><br/>"Cigarette?" said Charleston.<br/><br/>Candace and Temperance walked forward. They found a set of obelisks half buried in the sand.<br/><br/>"King in Yellow," muttered Temperance. "That was an obscure European play in the late nineteenth century. An American named Robert Chambers wrote some short stories about it."<br/><br/>"Really?" said Candace. "You should be able to find the play at a good used bookstore. I think Penguin came out with a good new scholarly edition a few years ago. 1947, I think...I mean, it's not a very good play."<br/><br/>"This could have gone a lot worse," said Charleston. "On the plus side, we fulfilled our obligations."<br/><br/>He and Jimmy stumbled up to the monoliths. Some had toppled over. Beyond them Jimmy could just make out the outlines of a depression or basin, perhaps an ornamental pool of some kind; it had long ago filled with sand and dirt.<br/><br/>Written on the monoliths were verses of a poem, a single different line on each of the monoliths:<br/><br/><i>Expectant we raise our muzzles to smell the air for hatred</i><br/><i>We strain our ears for the sound of love</i><br/><i>We the mute, the lame, the stupid, the dull, the weak</i><br/><i>We turn our blind eyes to the Hunter's killer</i><br/><i>We raise our hands in voices and prayer for an answer</i><br/><i>Nine teeth jut up in the maw of the living Earth:</i><br/><i>Return, Hastur! Heed us!</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>"Do you think that Mr. Jennings had anything to do with this?" said Temperance as they trudged back toward the gate to the complex.<br/><br/>"No, he's just a patsy," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Doesn't mean he won't shoot us," said Charleston. <br/><br/>"You two have a lot of experience with this," continued Temperance. "How do we save the man?"<br/><br/>"Percy? Trust me, Percy's gotten everything Percy wanted," said Charleston. "That's how this works. Percy doesn't need to be saved. He's happy with the outcome. Everybody who wasn't happy with the outcome? Those are the guys with their brains blown out."<br/><br/>"This is true," said Sam. "Why would you want to leave?"<br/><br/>"<i>That's</i> who Percy was," said Jimmy darkly.<br/><br/>"Why did you want to stay?" Temperance asked Sam.<br/><br/>"There's knowledge there!"<br/><br/>"There's knowledge everywhere," said Charleston. "Pick somewhere else. We can put you back in...but you have to stay down there with him."<br/><br/>"It's okay, there's other ways to get there."<br/><br/>"Is there any way to save him?" persisted Temperance. "Or save his soul?"<br/><br/>"Kill him?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure I understand the question," said Charleston. "World's a big place. Not everyone wants to read the Good Book and lead a good life."<br/><br/><br/><br/>As they came through the gate they could see Mr. Jennings standing next to two men in dark suits. Jimmy thought immediately that they had the look of government agents. Jennings looked up and pointed at them. His face was petrified with fear.<br/><br/>One of the agents grabbed him and threw him against the side of the trailer, so hard that he left a deep concave dent in the wall. Jennings' body slumped to the ground and blood pooled around him.<br/><br/>"Run," said Jimmy, gritting his teeth. He and the rest stumbled over to the car and hastily piled into it.<br/><br/>Temperance looked back and muffled a shriek. The "agents" <i>weren't casting shadows</i>. Jimmy cranked the engine and slammed down the accelerator.<br/><br/>"They don't cast shadows," said Temperance quietly. She looked behind them as the car bounded down the dirt road. One of the men in dark suits was jogging behind them, easily pacing them. And even though Jimmy had the engine revving against the redline, she could hear their pursuer say--quite calmly, and even at this distance:<br/><br/>"He comes."<br/><br/>But when Jimmy looked back in the rearview mirror there was nobody there...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459177/#Comment_459177" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-11T05:43:52+00:00" title="January 11, 2017  5:43AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brrrrrr.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459190/#Comment_459190" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-11T22:02:11+00:00" title="January 11, 2017 10:02PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Boo! :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459191/#Comment_459191" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-11T22:02:56+00:00" title="January 11, 2017 10:02PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: A Crack In Everything (Part 11)</b><br/><br/>They reached the Gas N' Go and skidded to a halt. Clare Medford came out of the office.<br/><br/>"How y'all doing? You find what you were looking for?" he said jauntily.<br/><br/>"We sure did," said Charleston with a toothy grin.<br/><br/>"I didn't expect to see you back. So soon," Clare hastily added.<br/><br/>"We found what we were looking for," said Temperance in a silent, terrified voice.<br/><br/>"Y'all have a nice time, ya hear. Enjoy your trip."<br/><br/><br/><br/>They drove in silence back to Las Vegas. They rode the elevator up to their suite. Lisa came out to meet them.<br/><br/>"Oh my God," she said, looking at their faces. She silently poured everyone a drink.<br/><br/>"I don't drink," said Temperance, tossing off her Scotch.<br/><br/>"Did you...find anything?" said Lisa anxiously. "It's Percy, isn't it? He's dead?"<br/><br/>"No," said Sam brightly.<br/><br/>Jimmy spluttered.<br/><br/>"He's alive?" said Lisa. "We have to go get him--"<br/><br/>"He's in a better place," said Sam.<br/><br/>"I don't understand."<br/><br/>"He's...the Percy you know is dead," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Is he in any danger?"<br/><br/>"No...but whoever goes near him will be."<br/><br/>"Is there...any other danger?"<br/><br/>"What do you know about the King in Yellow?" said Sam.<br/><br/>"I've never heard of him," said Lisa.<br/><br/>"He's a literary figure," said Candace.<br/><br/>"No he isn't..." muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Later that night Jimmy called the desk for a movie projector. "No problem, chief," said the desk clerk. "You want a live show too? Just know you can't charge admission; don't wanna get in dutch with the vice squad."<br/><br/>"Just get me the bloody projector," sighed Jimmy.<br/><br/>The reel of film he had recovered was about fifteen minutes long and quite confusing. Candace immediately recognized that it was obviously based on <i>The King in Yellow</i>, and probably Poe's "Masque of the Red Death"; the plot was similar. But the set design was extremely unusual and rather Expressionistic.<br/><br/>It was enough, however, for Temperance to track down some details on the film. It was produced by someone named Talbot Estus, who seemed to be dead, and directed by a New York artist named Amadou Lalin--the same person who had painted the picture in Percy's office.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Candace went through the items they had plundered from Percy's office. Lisa recognized one of the men in the torn up picture.<br/><br/>"That's Sol," she said. "Solomon Molinari. He was a noted mathematician. Italian. He was Jewish so he fled to England in the late 30s. We used to have tea with him."<br/><br/>Armed with that, Candace was able to find out that he was currently in a "mental rest facility" in Georgia called Joy Grove. Jimmy thought he recognized the name from somewhere; it turned out that Molinari had been a mountaineer in his youth and part of an Italian expedition that illegally entered Nepal in 1929...in fact, Molinari was the only survivor of the expedition.<br/><br/><i>[Outdoorsman use by JP.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459199/#Comment_459199" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-12T04:25:40+00:00" title="January 12, 2017  4:25AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While it's not as awesome as the famed Biology spend, I like that use of Outdoorsman.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459200/#Comment_459200" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-12T04:54:35+00:00" title="January 12, 2017  4:54AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks; I thought that would be a nice alternative use of it--Outdoorsy people might keep track of that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Though it's a spend, not a use, at least according to my notes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459205/#Comment_459205" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-12T16:48:29+00:00" title="January 12, 2017  4:48PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There may be a brief pause while I sort out the best way to convert the writeup to format; I'm experimenting with getting it in a form I could use to make an ebook from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459211/#Comment_459211" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-12T17:55:15+00:00" title="January 12, 2017  5:55PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nod.

I was wondering...well, you wouldn't happen to have any more of your deluxe prototypes? There are a couple of people in the Grey family."</p>\n<p>"Are you still travelling with Jimmy?"</p>\n<p>"No. Nooo. No."</p>\n<p>"Temperance..."</p>\n<p>"Mr. Wright may be around."</p>\n<p>"I'll be right out."</p>\n<p>And a day later an enormous camper pulled into the parking lot of their hotel with Murphy at the wheel. He proudly showed off the impressively detailed interior.</p>\n<p>"I'm so proud my little girl finally asked me for her adventuring car," sniffed Murphy. "See, here's the dinette. Table folds up for space. Galley kitchen. In the back is a bedroom. And if you close the door to this cabinet, tap twice, and open it up again, it reveals the gun rack."</p>\n<p>"Gun rack..."</p>\n<p>"I took ideas from a lot of different places. Maybe you didn't know this, but Jimmy used to have an armored limousine. I'm not gonna say this thing will stop a tank shell. But it should stop small arms fire. We took the engine out of a Kraut tank, and then I had my Germans work on it to make it work with good ol' American parts."</p>\n<p><em>[HP: Diesel, I assume.</em></p>\n<p><em>TP: This thing is gonna have its own personal trail of pollution.</em></p>\n<p><em>CP: We're rolling coal!]</em></p>\n<p>"I don't know what to say," said Temperance. "Thank you? But is this necessary?"</p>\n<p>"Well, pumpkin, I always hoped you'd get into the family adventure line. So I had my boys design this a while ago. I was hoping to give it to you when you got married."</p>\n<p>"I clearly need to talk to Mr. Wright. Why is there garlic and holy water in the gun rack?"</p>\n<p>"Just saying you can never be too safe."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Angels, Demons and Saints (Part 2)</b>\n<p>As their DC-4 loped across the long miles from Chicago down to Savannah, Jimmy petted Betty\u2014he'd bought her a seat and charged it to the Governor\u2014and reached deep into one of his coat pockets. He brought out a crumpled, water-stained note. He gingerly unfolded it and read it again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Dear Boss,</em></p>\n<em>I know you're gonna be real busy today and we won't have time to talk, so I'll just put this in your pocket in case something happens. I just want you to know that you're the best man I've ever met, and it's been an honor.</em><br/><em>Betty Auckland</em><br/></blockquote>\n<p>He put the letter back in his pocket. It was a very, very valuable thing; the only tangible reminder he had of another timeline, one where he\u2019d had an employee named Betty, a sweet young thing from Manhattan, Kansas who\u2019d talked like she was from New York, had been a hellion with a shotgun, and lived only to impress him enough to become a \u201creal\u201d private eye. But all that had been wiped away...18 years ago, now. He pushed away the memories. Sometimes he wondered what had happened to Betty in\xa0<em>this</em>\xa0timeline, the one where she had never met him. But he knew that it was better not to find out.</p>\n<p>He'd done enough damage to time, and vice versa, already.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>They stepped down from the plane onto the tarmac. Once again Jimmy felt the wet, moist heat slap him in the face. Sweat began pouring down his back, and he mopped his face with a handkerchief. They caught a taxi and went to the only hotel in town he knew, the same one he'd stayed in back in 1937.</p>\n<p>"How long y'all gonna be stayin'," drawled the front desk clerk.</p>\n<p>"Couple of days," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"All right then. I can get a taxi if you'n need to get around. Is that you dog? We don't usually allow...dogs."</p>\n<p>"She's extremely well behaved."</p>\n<p>"I don't know..."\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy simpered and seemed to shrink. "She's my only companion. These youngins wandering around..." He coughed piteously.</p>\n<p>"All right, all right."</p>\n<p>Betty howled as Jimmy led her upstairs.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"This is Dr. Keaton," said a man with a thick Southern accent over the phone. "I'm told you're a mental health inspector from California, Mr. Wright? What is it you want from us?"</p>\n<p>"We want to see how other facilities handle their patients. A sampling."</p>\n<p>"Ah, you heard about our program for government employees. I'll put you and your people in touch with Dr. Montague. We have a number of interesting patients...well, you'll see when you get here."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>That evening Candace went down to a college bar. She had hoped to hear some Bop, but she was disappointed. The music was some kind of R&amp;B...but with a stepped up beat.\xa0</p>\n<p>"What's all this about 'rocking around a clock'?" she asked a cleancut young man.</p>\n<p>"Latest thing, ma'am. You a professor?"</p>\n<p>"Not here, but I teach literature. And I'm a writer."</p>\n<p>"What did you write? I have to read a lot of books, 'cause I'm in college."</p>\n<p>"It was called\xa0<em>Homefront</em>. It's about a woman and her struggles during the war."</p>\n<p>"That's heavy. Too bad you ain't a mystery writer."</p>\n<p>Candace tried not to wince. "Why is that?"</p>\n<p>It turned out they had an interesting mystery. About a year ago one of the African-American nurses up at the "Mental Rest Facility" had been brutally murdered, almost cut into pieces. But the frightening thing was that there was far too much blood, enough blood for two murders, although that was never made public; nor was any other body ever found. The murder had been blamed on an African-American inmate of the facility.</p>\n<p>"What's the name of the woman?" asked Candace.</p>\n<p>"Miss Yates. Fellow they said did it was named Luke."</p>\n<p>"Thanks so much. Can you tell me where the library is?"</p>\n<p>He did, and he tried to pick her up, but she made it back to the hotel without any complications.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"Dr. Keaton, I'm Mr. Wright. This is my assistant, Miss Heartbrooke." Jimmy was happy that the office was air conditioned; he hadn't worn a suit in years and it was making him sweat even worse.</p>\n<p>"Charmed, I'm sure," said Dr. Keaton, the Chairman of the Joy Grove Mental Rest Facility. He was balding and wore bifocals. Jimmy vaguely remembered meeting him the last time he had been in Savannah. "I'm afraid I don't know who your other two companions are."</p>\n<p>"Oh, Mr. Chiu? He's a potential patient, and that's his nurse. Don't worry, he's fine. We want to see how he reacts."</p>\n<p>"I see," said Keaton. He sighed and shrugged his shoulders. "Well, I suppose that's fine. I'm at the age when I'll be the Chairman Emeritus soon enough, let these young doctors take over. They do have some strange ideas though."</p>\n<p>He led them on a tour of the hospital; he was especially proud of the new wing, and the air conditioning throughout the facility. "I'm glad you came, I'm sure it's because of our special patients program. One of the Federal administrations sends us their special cases time to time, and they are very generous with their grants. Oh, here's Dr. Montague now."</p>\n<p><i>[Incidentally we're now into the actual parts of\xa0Tatters of the King, more or less.</i></p>\n<p>A fortyish woman in a lab coat came walking up. She had very red hair and a pair of glasses on a cord around her neck. "Pleased ta' meet you. Edwina Montague," she said with a lilting Scottish brogue.</p>\n<p><i>[Well, maybe Edwina had one; unfortunately my concentration on learning Northern Irish accents have degraded my Scottish accent quite a bit.]</i></p>\n<p>"Dr. Montague is on a fellowship here. I have her on some of our more difficult cases."</p>\n<p>"James," said Jimmy, extending his hand.\xa0</p>\n<p>"Good Scottish name."</p>\n<p>"I'm not from there."</p>\n<p>"More's the pity. Is there anyone in particular you wished to see?"</p>\n<p>"We've heard about Dr. Molinari."</p>\n<p>"Of course. And," she said conspiratorially, nodding at Charleston, "what may I ask is the situation with him?"</p>\n<p>"Oh him? He's a potential patient."</p>\n<p>"Ah, I'll have some of our interns work him up then."</p>\n<p>"It's a very challenging case," said Jimmy, breaking into a sweat. "Be careful. Bring his handler."</p>\n<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459381/#Comment_459381" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-18T04:13:19+00:00" title="January 18, 2017  4:13AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aww!

It hadn't been easy to get some of them\u2014they only existed as stories in Italian newspapers....</p>\n<p>Back in 1929 several professors at the University of Milan had mounted an expedition to Tibet. It was led by Roberto Anzalone and his student Carlo Scipione, along with their colleague Dr. Solomon Molinari. There was also an Italian ex-seminarian named Laurencio Pancetti, an English ex-pat, Malcolm Quarrie, and Roberto del Negro, an Italian soldier from the Alpine division in nominal command.\xa0</p>\n<p>However, rather than go to Tibet, they illegally entered Nepal. On the night of November 6, 1929, while scaling the heights near a place called Drakmar\u2014an interesting geological site with religious significance\u2014del Negro fell to his death. In the spirit of mountaineering they pressed on, but a blizzard forced them to take shelter in an ice cave, where everyone except Molinari died of exposure. He was found wandering around half-mad by local Buddhist monks.</p>\n<p><em>[1-point Library Use by TP spend to get this data. And that really is the spirit of mountaineering!]</em></p>\n<p>Dr. Montague led them into the New Wing of Joy Grove, which was decorated in the most modern style. Dr. Molinari's room was at the end of a hall. As they entered, Candace cast her eyes around the rom. It was well-furnished, as befitted a self-committed patient. Most of the walls were covered by bookcases\u2014predominantly mathematical texts, along with picture books on mountaineering. A framed poster celebrated the Italian conquest of K2 in 1954. In the blank spaces between bookcases it seemed Molinari had written equations, interspersed with stylized, elongated drawings of animals. Everything else was neat and austere.</p>\n<p>Solomon Molinari was seated behind a small table he was using as a desk. He was tall even hunched over in his chair; he had rather wild grey hair, thick horn-rimmed glasses, and a small yarmulke on his head. He looked up rather crossly as they filed in. "Yes, yes, what, who are you, why are you here to see me?"</p>\n<p>"Although I'm from California, we do inspections of other states to see if we can learn anything, or offer advice," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Unannounced? I left Italy in 1938 to escape things like this."</p>\n<p>"You left Italy to come\xa0<em>here</em>?"</p>\n<p>"No, I left Italy to come to England, then the United States. Now I am here."</p>\n<p>"That\u2019s a lot of countries.\u201d</p>\n<p>"I'm European."</p>\n<p>"It\u2019s pretty standard, Dr. Wright," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"I am watched over\u2014cared for, I mean; the doctors are nice, especially Dr. Edie," said Molinari.</p>\n<p>"I think Dr. Wright would like to know what you were working on that caused you to come here," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"I was working on a government project. The stress was a little too much for me."</p>\n<p>"I'll be on my way to see about your Chinese friend," said Dr. Montague.\xa0</p>\n<p>"Chinese, Italians, what else do we need here," muttered Molinari. "What do you want to know? I'll tell you what I can. Some is still classified."</p>\n<p>"Why don't we start with that," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"I was working on a project called TAROT. It was an interesting project, headed by a friend of mine, Percival Schicksal."</p>\n<p>"Is he still alive?"</p>\n<p>"I don't know. The details of my last days are somewhat hazy in my recollection ...Percival was a very interesting man, artistically talented...he brought many different thinkers, artists together. Of course, much of it was nonsense, like the name of the project. We all had a Tarot card assigned to us."</p>\n<p>"Oh really?" said Candace. "Which were you?"</p>\n<p>"The Magician. Card number one."</p>\n<p>"Why?"</p>\n<p>"An interesting question. In the Tarot of Marseille, the card is a mountebank, a con artist. But in more recent versions of the deck, he is a real magician, in the sense Crowley meant. Percival was The Fool, which is apparently a card of great significance."</p>\n<p>Jimmy stared. "I have some other questions, I'm just not sure how to phrase them. You see, we've been to the facility."</p>\n<p>"I was not under the impression there was a lot there anymore."</p>\n<p>"There wasn't...except for the trap door held down by a heavy oil tank."</p>\n<p>"Ah. You've been to the labs. Are you going to ask me about mind control? Because we weren't doing that. Not really. We had chemicals that had interesting effects on the psyche. We investigated them, and methods of propaganda...some from the last century..."</p>\n<p>"Why exactly did Dr. Schicksal choose you?"</p>\n<p>Molinari leaned back and sighed. "When I was younger, I was a member of a secret society\u2014a social club, see? It was called\xa0<em>I fratelli del segno giallo</em>. You don't speak Italian. The brotherhood of the yellow sign. And I suppose you know I was on an expedition...we were all members, except for del Negro; the government wouldn't let us leave without a fascist."</p>\n<p>"Can I ask you about the trip?"</p>\n<p>"It was terrible. Everyone died except me. How I survived, I do not know."</p>\n<p>"And why did you go to Nepal instead of Tibet?"</p>\n<p>"The Brotherhood...mostly were Christian mystics. But they had a degree of syncretism. It is why I was allowed to join. They were interested in the Buddhist mystics of that part of Nepal."</p>\n<p><em>[Here I asked for an Interpersonal spend to get more from the good doctor, as he had kept his silence for thirty years about the expedition.]</em></p>\n<p>"Dr. Molinari, let's be honest here," said Candace. "I know this must be difficult, that it was hard to come to this place, even if it was for your health. We're not here to cause you any trouble...but we honestly need to know what is happening, what happened at that location."</p>\n<p>"You're a very sweet young woman...you remind me of Juliet. Ah, I shouldn't talk about them, they're probably all dead. Except for Carl, and he writes the most ridiculous things." He gestured at a mimeographed newsletter on his desk.</p>\n<p>"I think talking to us could be an important step in dealing with these things."</p>\n<p><em>[Reassurance spend by CP.]</em></p>\n<p>"You are like Juliet, if only she had stayed with Carl, maybe he wouldn't be so crazy. It's too dangerous to tell you everything. We always meant to go to Nepal. Tibet was a feint. We went to Drakmar...to get in touch with the Divine."</p>\n<p>"That's a noble goal," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"That's never a good idea," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"I can't say I disagree with either of you. In the final moment...Scipione went insane and killed del Negro. And Anzalone killed Quarrie but died in the struggle. Pancetti was already lost at that point. By the grace of the Sign I returned...how I do not know. I don't know why I was spared."</p>\n<p>"The Sign?" said Candace.</p>\n<p>"The Yellow Sign. What we were brothers of. It is a rune of mystic importance...but you should not seek it out. It is not healthy...but much like my friend Amadou, I sometimes wonder if I made the right decision."</p>\n<p>"Which decision?"</p>\n<p>"To stop Quarrie."</p>\n<p>"Yes, you did," said Jimmy.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459417/#Comment_459417" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-19T16:31:50+00:00" title="January 19, 2017  4:31PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Angels, Demons and Saints (Part 4)</b>\n<p>Dr. Montague chatted with Temperance and Charleston as she took them to an examination room. She had trained as a surgeon, but during the London Blitz came to the conclusion that psychological wounds were more difficult to treat than physical ones and changed her profession.</p>\n<p>"What's the name of your friend," she asked.</p>\n<p>"Mr. Chiu."</p>\n<p>"And his first name?"</p>\n<p>"Charleston," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"You're kidding me."</p>\n<p>"I am the original. I predate the candy bar. I feel like they owe me a check."</p>\n<p>"We've talked about this, Charleston," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>In response to her question, Charleston told Dr. Montague he had lost his sight in a terrible accident, showing her the nasty scar across his forehead. "It happened when I was much, much younger, still a teenager."</p>\n<p>"You don't think about hurting yourself?"</p>\n<p>"I don't think I understand the question. People hurt themselves all the time."</p>\n<p>"He seems to have megalomaniacal tendencies," put in Temperance. "Talking himself up at inappropriate moments. Delusions of grandeur. Sometimes goes wandering where he ought not be. Problems with social norms."</p>\n<p>"Most of our patients here are non-violent, save for Mr. Harriwell, who butchered that nurse. But had we turned him over to the authorities, he'd have gone to the gas chamber. The poor man lacks his wits; so we arranged to keep him here."</p>\n<p>Violent cases at the Rest Facility, Edie elaborated, were quite rare, although because it was a secure environment, they had a number of FBI and other government employees who had "seen a little too much."</p>\n<p>"Nobody's accused me of seeing too much," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"What an interesting...p'raps sense of humor is a stretch," said Edie.</p>\n<p>"He falls back on gallows humor," said Temperance. "We're hoping that you can cure the puns and the quips."</p>\n<p>"I dinna allow I'm such a good psychiatrist. I could cut his tongue out clean."</p>\n<p>"I hear you can do wonders with electroshock."</p>\n<p>"Aye, a marvelous new therapy. Verra interesting results. Still calibrating, still calibrating...an excellent way to lift depression."</p>\n<p>"Did you say lift\xa0<em>oppression</em>?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Depression. D'ye nae speak English?"</p>\n<p>She led them into an interview room where two interns were licking their chops over diagnosing Charleston.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"Tell me more about Amadou," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"A questing soul, a gentle soul. Very, very close to Percival," said Dr. Molinari. "Very close."</p>\n<p>"Ah," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"<em>Sono un uomo del mundo</em>. Percival brought him in because of his inspiration, an area we should mine in the human psyche. Turns out he was right, he was useful...although the child was a little broken. I heard he is in San Francisco, or New York, where he studied...I'm not sure, he left before me. I think at the end he felt Percivale had gone a little too far."</p>\n<p>"You said you stopped Malcolm Quarrie from doing something, back in 1929," said Candace. "What was it?"</p>\n<p>"From...from bringing a god down to Earth."</p>\n<p>"I'm so glad you stopped him," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"I...am not sure if it was the right thing. They called him...<em>il re en giallo</em>. The King in Yellow. Roberto killed Quarrie to prevent His coming. When I returned, I was in no condition to look for Pancetti...I told everyone that he died. He must have died. None of us should have survived."</p>\n<p>"Tell me what you remember about your last days at TAROT," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Percival...hoped to speak to a god."</p>\n<p>"Why do people always want to speak to a god?"</p>\n<p>"Why\xa0<em>wouldn't</em>\xa0you want to speak to one? Do you never think of this, to know the answers to the universal questions?"</p>\n<p>"It's never worth knowing."</p>\n<p>"I have to disagree with you."</p>\n<p>"Do you see the chaos you cause\u2014"</p>\n<p>"Do you see the chaos outside? Let me tell you. This was June 1953. On June 16, when we began our tests, there were riots and strikes in East Germany. All throughout the world, there was a tremor of freedom, of breaking of restraint. While we were doing the working! With that, that Cassie!"</p>\n<p>"Cassie?"</p>\n<p>"Some girl Percival found. He said she was magic. The world was changing! And don't think this was the first time this ever happened: 1848. 1794. All these times. 1903, the Boxer Rebellion. Talk to Carl, he'll tell\u2014no. I say too much."</p>\n<p>"The gods don't give a damn about us," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"You know this for sure? You've talked to God?"</p>\n<p>"My share of them.

Study the Greeks, study Dionysus instead of being a useless civil servant! Now get out of my room!"</p>\n<p>"We could have gotten more information out of him," said Candace when they were back in the hall, "if you hadn't talked nonsense!"</p>\n<p>"Gods!

They were interested in his accident.</p>\n<p>"I find it traumatic to think about it," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Look mac, you're in a mental hospital," said one intern. "It's like having a heart attack in a hospital, it's the best place to do it."</p>\n<p>"I saw a flash of metal and then darkness."</p>\n<p>"Someone knifed you in the eyes? and scooped them out?"</p>\n<p>"It was a lucky hit, just not for me. I feel it was a turning point in my life. There are things you're better off not seeing."</p>\n<p>"I don't know. You've never seen Jean Harlow or Marilyn Monroe."</p>\n<p>"You're right. I guess I'd just have to feel it out."</p>\n<p>The interns proceeded to describe the ladies in graphic detail. They offered to shoot Charleston up with lithium. "Have your nurse check in with us, we're very interested in your case."</p>\n<p>"I've had a violent past."</p>\n<p>"How violent? You have trauma?"</p>\n<p>Charleston agreed he might. He asked about Luke Harriwell. Nobody had figured out how he had gotten out of his cell, the interns said, explaining that Harriwell had been a Tuskegee airman who'd gotten into a car accident after the war. Brain damage was so extensive that he now had a child's mind.</p>\n<p>"And he dismantled a nurse?" said Charleston incredulously.</p>\n<p>"Maybe he had a flashback to the war. What we don't know is how he got out. Maybe he had a key."</p>\n<p>"You don't always need a key to get out of a locked room."</p>\n<p>"Wait, what?"</p>\n<p>"I'm just trying to be honest. Back when I was in my twenties I had trouble facing my troubles, so I had to learn to get out of rooms I didn't want to be in."</p>\n<p>"What are you, a contortionist?"</p>\n<p><em>[Me: in that you twisted space and time around...]</em></p>\n<p>"I contorted some things, you could say."</p>\n<p>"I gotta say, mac, you don't sound crazy."</p>\n<p>"It's been twenty years," said Charleston wolfishly. "I've had a lot of practice."</p>\n<p>"I like this guy. We should keep him around just for laughs."</p>\n<p>"Maybe I could share a room with Luke."</p>\n<p>"Hell no! You might kill each other! We don't want that, we're on a strict no killings policy! And we can't keep him in restraints all the time. That's inhuman."</p>\n<p>"You do keep him in them sometimes?"</p>\n<p>"Sure, when we take him out of the cell...hey, we should put them together."</p>\n<p>"Yeah," said the other intern. "We might get a paper out of it."</p>\n<p>A while later they led Luke, a large African-American man, into the room. They kept heavy shackles on his wrists, and chained him to the table in front of Charleston. "I don't know no Chinese man," said Luke.</p>\n<p>"Neither do I, I'm born and raised in Shanghai. Shanghai West Virginia."</p>\n<p>"I don't know no one from West Virginia either. Can't shake hands."</p>\n<p>"I can't see them to shake anyway."</p>\n<p>"Okay."</p>\n<p>Charleston relaxed and gently felt out with his seventh sense. He could tell that whatever Luke had seen, it was something more than a human terror.</p>\n<p><em>[CP and I worked this out as a way for Charleston to sometimes overcome his blindness; he has a ridiculous amount of Cthulhu Mythos as justification.]</em></p>\n<p>"I saw the Devil," said Luke. He lisped a bit:\xa0<em>debbil</em>.</p>\n<p>"I've spoken to the Devil," whispered Charleston.</p>\n<p>"You can't be from the Devil, you still got skin. The Devil ain't got no skin. I saw him cut up that sister lady."</p>\n<p><em>[CP: Does being skinless ring a bell?</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: Yeah, there are various skinless entities, but you can't tell which.</em></p>\n<p><em>CP: Skinless entity that dismembers doesn't narrow it down?</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: Pretty much, yeah.</em></p>\n<p><em>CP: The company I keep.]</em></p>\n<p>"Why did the Devil chop her up and leave you alone?"</p>\n<p>"I don't know. Maybe the Devil wanted a lady. Maybe he come back for me."</p>\n<p>"Did the woman say anything to the Devil?"</p>\n<p>"Mostly she just scream. The Devil said things. He got a high-pitched voice. I was mostly screaming. I seen him walking outside my room. I were in it. The Devil opened up my room, that's why they think I did that thing. Sister weren't in my room, they don't let the ladies come to my room at night. That's a pity. I used to have a wife. She was nice to me."</p>\n<p>"So the Devil...walked past your door, slaughtered this poor nurse..."</p>\n<p>"I suppose you could say he was in the process of slaughtering. Then he open my door and yelled at me. 'You get out there boy, or I come kill you too.' So I run out, then they catch me. He had blue eyes. Blue-eyed devil."</p>\n<p><em>[TP: Wait a minute...</em></p>\n<p><em>JP: (laughs)</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: And she sticks the landing!]</em></p>\n<p>"What about Miss Yates, who died?"</p>\n<p>"She were nice to me. She came in to feed me. Say, good morning Luke."</p>\n<p>"What kind of knife did the Devil have?"</p>\n<p>"Soldier knife, like what I had in war."</p>\n<p>"That's how I lost these," said Charleston, as Temperance helped Luke draw a sketch of something that resembled a bayonet.</p>\n<p>"I gotta say, you don't seem crazy to me," continued Charleston.</p>\n<p>"That what I say, but they say Luke, you can't take care of yourself no more. And they probably right. I ain't seen the skinless Devil no more."</p>\n<p>"Kinda cowardly."</p>\n<p>"I ain't talking bout no Devil, he come back for me."</p>\n<p>"Was he bleeding?" asked Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Oh yes."</p>\n<p>"Did you see if there was a trail..."</p>\n<p>"The thing I seen that was very strange is that he cut a big slice of skin offa Miss Yates, and then cut the same slice of skin off himself. And he kept doing like that. 'Cept the blood stopped and his skin start grow back."</p>\n<p>"Well, that's devilish."</p>\n<p>"It's black magic. Like them Gullah folk do."</p>\n<p>"You talk to any doctors about this?" asked Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Yup. All of them. They say, Luke you gotta talk about this. Mostly they is the male doctors like talking to you\u2014the ones there, laughing at you. And sometimes Miss Edie, she nice to me."</p>\n<p>"You ever see anyone else?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Sometimes, when they let me walk in the yard. They all government people."</p>\n<p>"Veterans?"</p>\n<p>"I suppose. Some of them real messed up. Worse'n Luke."</p>\n<p>"You're all right."</p>\n<p>"Okay.

Candace had pulled a bunch of newspaper records from the library. Much to her chagrin she found out that Luke's wife Martha had died a year ago of a heart attack. Nobody had told him.</p>\n<p>Jimmy took the time to drop by the local chief of police. He let a little of his old camaraderie with the police leak into his personality. The police seemed to feel that Luke should have been sent to the gas chamber...or taken care of, if you know what I mean. Fortunately for Luke, the Mental Rest Facility had good security.</p>\n<p>"Did he have any blood on him?"</p>\n<p>"No, he must have cleaned up. But he had the knife. Military knife. We sent that up to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. We do things proper here, despite what they may tell you in Cal-eee-forn-ya. Gotcha yourselves too many freaks and dropouts..."</p>\n<p>After listening to the chief\u2019s unprompted racist tirade, Jimmy was able to browbeat the chief into turning over Luke's file to him. He was quite surprised by some of the details\u2014the cuts were very precise, especially considering that Miss Yates had been running...at first. To his non-medical eye this smacked of surgical precision, not anything like what Luke would have been capable of.</p>\n<p><em>[Cop Talk spend by JP to get the file.]</em></p>\n<p>He spent the next couple of days working on trying to identify the knife, even to the point of swallowing his pride and calling some of the people he used to know in the FBI.</p>\n<p>"Jimmy? My god, I heard you died in Peoria."</p>\n<p>"That's the story I'm getting. I have a knife that I need identified. Lemme send the picture up to you."</p>\n<p>The next day his friend called back. "It's a British military knife, mostly issued to the Home Army during the Blitz."</p>\n<p><em>[Research spend by JP.</em></p>\n<p><em>There was some discussion of the facts of the case:</em></p>\n<p><em>HP: Did they think he hid the knife in his room? Was the door forced? Was there a key missing?</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: Hey, they did a perfectly acceptable job of framing this up!]</em></p>\n<p>The next day there was another murder.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The papers of course had a field day splashing Luke's picture all over the front page. Another nurse, Miss Long, had been butchered in much the same fashion as poor Miss Yates. Undoubtedly there would have been enormous pressure to drag him out of the hospital...if anyone knew where he was. He had vanished.</p>\n<p>Jimmy drove them back up to the hospital. Dr. Keaton was quite agitated but relieved to see friendly faces. He didn't know how Luke had escaped; he wondered if he had had help.</p>\n<p>"And I have to take on some cases now," he groused. "Dr. Montague isn't here right now. You know how it is, it's very hard for a psychiatrist to get the help they need...well, anyway, she took a leave of absence, heading out to the West Coast somewhere. A conference of some sort. And she was so distraught this morning! She had a real rapport with Luke. And she really is a caring woman. She seems frosty on the exterior but that's just her being Scottish. The warm climate here has mellowed out her blood a bit though."</p>\n<p>Temperance bit her lip and tried to remember that Dr. Keaton had been trained in the 1920s.</p>\n<p>The sad details came out. The police thought that the knife used had been a scalpel, not any of the regular knives\u2014all those were tightly controlled since the last incident.</p>\n<p>"Looks like our killer has a particular predilection for the lovely ladies," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Very often serial murder is a sexual crime," said Dr. Keaton. "The killer murders out of some deep seated sexual dysfunction. It's not a crime of passion."</p>\n<p>Jimmy asked if they could be shown around. "I'm not sure how this comes under your\xa0<em>regulatory</em>\xa0purview," muttered Keaton, but Temperance pointed out how a glowing report on how they dealt with the situation would go over well in Washington.</p>\n<p><em>[Bureaucracy spend by TP.]</em></p>\n<p>Luke's room showed no sign of being forced. He hadn't been kept in restraints, so if somebody had opened it he could just walk out. Temperance decided to ask Dr. Keaton if there was anywhere that Luke could hide himself that might have been missed on the initial sweeps.</p>\n<p>"Well, there is the old maximum security wing," said Dr. Keaton. "We don't use it anymore. There was an experimental program run there in the 1930s that didn't work out."</p>\n<p>Jimmy resolutely looked away.</p>\n<p><em>[Indeed, it was the location of a scene in Eternal Lies.]</em></p>\n<p>"Why don't you tear things like that down?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Contractors, permits, it's a nightmare to do that kind of work."</p>\n<p>With some grousing, Dr. Keaton agreed to take them to the old wing, cautioning them that the standards of care in those days were not up to the level of today. And so it proved; many of the cells had rotting padding on the walls, and slots on the bottom of their doors to slide food into them.</p>\n<p>Candace was the one who noticed a larger than average amount of flies buzzing in and out of a closet.\xa0</p>\n<p>"Did the police search this area?" she asked Dr. Keaton.</p>\n<p>"They said they did."</p>\n<p>"Well, no reason to doubt their efficiency," said Charleston. "Let's move on." He and Jimmy pushed forward, leaving Candace behind. She gulped nervously, and then opened the door.</p>\n<p>Luke Harriwell had been stuffed in there. His throat had been slit, and his eyes removed. Post-mortem, Candace thought, as she screamed.\xa0</p>\n<p>"What was that?" said Dr. Keaton from the next ward.</p>\n<p>"Sounds like a woman screaming," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Of course it does! This is as bad as that day in 1937. I never did get to the bottom of that. And my best assistant quit! I wonder what happened to Bethany Mae..."</p>\n<p>Temperance ran back to Candace. "What's going on," she began, and then saw Luke's body.</p>\n<p>She started to scream as well and they began to pray in Latin.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Of course the cops came. They hadn't missed the body in their previous sweep; whoever had killed Luke had moved his body. Charleston thought that the removal of the eyes was psychologically significant: as if he had seen something he wasn't supposed to have seen.</p>\n<p><em>[Criminology and Psychology.]</em></p>\n<p>"His throat was cut surgically," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Yeaaaah," said Temperance. "And where did Edie go?"</p>\n<p>"Out west. And she started at Joy Grove about a year ago...right before Miss Yates died."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459543/#Comment_459543" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T01:57:59+00:00" title="January 24, 2017  1:57AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder whether the cops will think that someone "took care" of Luke, as it's ever so much tidier for them if that's the case...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459558/#Comment_459558" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T16:53:13+00:00" title="January 24, 2017  4:53PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yanno, I didn't think much about that (as the Investigators skedaddled right after the murder), but undoubtedly you're correct about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459559/#Comment_459559" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T16:55:19+00:00" title="January 24, 2017  4:55PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Angels, Demons and Saints (Part 7)</b>\n<p>They took the next flight out to Los Angeles, winging through St. Louis and Denver. The RV was waiting for them, along with Lisa Schicksal, who was eager to talk to them. Jimmy and Candace ran over the names Dr. Molinari had mentioned: Juliet, Carl, and Amadou. Lisa knew Carl Simon a bit, but not the others.</p>\n<p>Temperance decided to start tracking down the actors from the reel of film Jimmy had recovered in Nevada. Although she wasn't a filmmaker, it was evident that the film was made in a largish studio. She decided to track down an acquaintance of her mother, the actress Olivia Clarendon.</p>\n<p><em>[Photography or Accounting would have put them on the direct trail to the studio and who hired it, but nobody had those abilities. So TP spent High Society to talk to Olivia, who is a thinly veiled Olivia de Haviland. (She was a character in Eternal Lies.)]</em></p>\n<p>"You must be Temperance," said Olivia when they met at her room in the Beverly Hills Hotel. It overlooked the swimming pool where a couple of bleached blonde sun worshippers languished in a way they hoped would attract attention. "I knew your mother slightly, through Mr. Wright. Shame that he died in Pakistan." She had a mid-Atlantic accent, a bit more polished than Cary Grant's.</p>\n<p>"There are so many rumors about his death."</p>\n<p>"Did he not die? I'd dearly like to see him again. Such an amusing little man. You had a question about a film?\xa0<em>The Unanswered Question</em>? Doesn't wring a bell."</p>\n<p>Temperance had brought the reel, and they watched it together in silence. "Well, that was a piece of shite," said Olivia. "I know who must have shot it. Talbot Estus. Has his lighting style all over it. He's not bad, just one of those avant-garde types."</p>\n<p>"Art for art's sake?"</p>\n<p>"Oh yes. I met him at a party once. Unfortunately he's dead. Killed himself on New Year's Day, 1954. I suppose I could have my man reach out to his agent and see what he was working on."</p>\n<p>A few days later Temperance got a mimeographed sheet of paper from one of the lower-tier talent agencies in the city. It had the cast list of\xa0<em>The Unanswered Question</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Michael Gillen (The Stranger, costumes)</p>\nJean Hewart (Camilla)<br/>George Keith (The Prince, nobles)<br/>Hannah Keith (Cassilda)<br/>Walter Paige (Noble, The King)<br/>Cinematography by Talbot Estus<br/>Written and directed by Amadou Lalin</blockquote>\n<p>A little bit of research turned up some details: Michael Gillen had mostly been a costumer (he had worked with Estus on all his prior films), not an actor; he owned a small clothing boutique in Hollywood. Jean Hewart had been trained as an opera singer and returned to that career; she was a singer in the San Francisco Opera Company. George and Hannah Keith still worked in Hollywood, George as a studio executive and Hannah as a character actress.</p>\n<p>Walter Paige wasn't in Hollywood at all; he worked for an insurance company in New York. A quick call to him by Temperance turned up that he was mostly embarrassed by his brief college fling with acting, especially the movie in question.</p>\n<p>Temperance rang up George and Hannah Keith and arranged for the entire crew to have lunch with them. George didn't have much to say; he'd played the Prince and some background nobles. He described the shoot as a bit crazy and said that while Amadou had a number of very artistic ideas about the sets and lighting (and had written the dialogue), most of the actual directing had been done by Talbot Estus, who had experience with blocking and the physical details of making a movie.</p>\n<p>Hannah was more thoughtful. "It was a ridiculous thing. As far as I know it was never distributed or even shown. Amadou was a kind of ethereal guy. The thing is, I don't think I ever did any better work. Although I had really terrible nightmares for months after we wrapped."</p>\n<p>She had worked with Talbot on previous projects. She didn't know any of the actors, although she had grown close to Jean who played her daughter (at least, her daughter sometimes) Camilla. Jean had been excited to do the movie; she had mostly done stage work but wanted, like so many young actresses, to break into movies. She'd enjoyed her time very much.</p>\n<p>"I'm a perfectly \xa0adequate actress. I know I'll never be Bette Davis," said Hannah.</p>\n<p>"Don't sell yourself short, kid," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Acting is my job. I show up and do it, really well. But Jean...she's a real artist, an opera singer; the work really affected her. I can give you her number if you want to speak to her."</p>\n<p>One curious thing, Hannah said, was that almost all the special effects had been done "in camera", that is without using any post-production trickery. She still wasn't sure how some of them had been captured\u2014like the sequence where the King replaced her without anyone noticing in Act II. They'd filmed it at two in the morning on a drafty sound stage in Culver City.</p>\n<p>"Did you keep any mementos? Props?" asked Charleston.</p>\n<p>"No, when we struck Amadou made us give everything back. A bunch of guys in dark suits kicked us all out and drove him off...I guess to Nevada, I think that's where he lived."</p>\n<p>Before they ended lunch, Hannah showed them pictures of her infant daughter. Her name was Camille.</p>\n<p><em>[TP: Oooh, creepy child.</em></p>\n<p><em>CP: (in character???)

His years on the road had made him wise to gay subculture.</p>\n<p><em>[Counterculture 2+ got the foot in the door; the group has a paucity of Reassurance, we discovered.]</em></p>\n<p>"Strange shoot. Talbot made some films, they didn't go over so well," Michael told them over coffee. They were sitting in his design studio in the back room of his shop; dressmakers dummies leered into the corners, and falls of silk and satin draped from racks. It was getting near awards season, after all.</p>\n<p>Michael was a pleasant man in his forties, with greying curly hair and a soft Texas accent. "People called them pornographic," he continued. "Ridiculous, they just didn't understand the European art Talbot was influenced by. Can't do male nudity in America. Poor Talbot had nightmares that kept getting worse and worse after we made that picture. I tried to do what I could for him...he told me he regretted making the film, that he never should have done it. But also that he would never make anything that good again."</p>\n<p>"What were the nightmares about?" asked Jimmy.</p>\n<p>Wandering in a strange city, said Michael. Sometimes being on the sets, but they had somehow become real. And sometimes just being chased. Talbot had had spells where he would wake up and still be asleep but couldn't move; he said that when it happened he would see dark figures with red eyes who suffocated him. Michael had had a dream like that as well once. Never so scared in my life, he told them, and that he didn't see how anyone could last long having those dreams every day.</p>\n<p>"I didn't like my part. It was small but important. I didn't like it...I had to wear a mask all the time." He'd kept it; it was a pure white mask made to look like porcelain, with the features just black slits. It resembled the painting Amadou had made for Percival.</p>\n<p><em>[CP was interested if anything was ceremonial or mystic about the mask; I offered a Cthulhu Mythos spend...]</em></p>\n<p>Charleston didn't like the mask. He knew something about the mythos of Hastur and the King in Yellow, although like most people he was unclear about what the difference between them was. The main thing he knew was that there was always repetition in the stories: there were always the two Ladies, and the King, and the Stranger.</p>\n<p>And sometimes the Stranger chased down people who had seen the Yellow Sign.</p>\n<p>"I don't know where Amadou is, and I don't care. If he hadn't hired Talbot, he'd still be alive today," concluded Michael sadly.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Before they left for San Francisco, Candace called up Nabokov. "We have quite the mystery going on...and I saw something a few days ago that I have never seen before...it terrified me."</p>\n<p>"Would you like to talk about it?" said Vladimir in his cultured voice.</p>\n<p>"It was terrible. A man who was accused of murder was murdered."</p>\n<p>"Ah, how Dostoevskian. I hate Dostoevsky."</p>\n<p><em>[Actually true! I have Nabokov's lecture notes from when he taught at Cornell.]</em></p>\n<p>"I understand," said Nabokov, "what a terrible shock this must have been for you. I left Russia because of the Revolution. My father was assassinated. But I have found, that although these were terrible experiences, and difficult to talk about, they have engaged my writing. As an artist you must plumb the depths of your own terror. Certainly the book I have just completed forced me to dig deep into my own psyche and learn things about myself that were perhaps not good things to learn. But as a true artist, you must pursue your vision. Unless of course you're just going to use it as material for those ridiculous things you churn out."</p>\n<p><em>[The book was, of course,\xa0</em>Lolita<em>.]</em></p>\n<p>"I'm not going to...deny that some of these ideas would be interesting..."</p>\n<p>"Oh, Candace, one day you will make a commitment to your art. I understand. I have to go teach these morons about\xa0<em>The Idiot</em>. Take care."</p>\n<p>Candace hung up. She was still shaken, and couldn't help but wonder if what her husband had seen in the war wasn't like what she had seen in Savannah.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>They drove up the coast in Temperance's enormous RV, swaying along the Pacific Coast Highway and down the peninsula until the misty hills of San Francisco came into sight. The harbor was full of cargo ships heading to the wharves; there was also a Navy destroyer coming back to port. Temperance remembered her father working there during the war; Jimmy had shipped through there on missions for the OSS as well.</p>\n<p>He wondered about the private eye he'd hired in the city to look into Amadou; he wasn't returning his calls.</p>\n<p>Candace was excited; she wanted to visit City Lights Bookstore, Lawrence Ferlinghetti's shop where he published exciting new poets (including himself) and books banned in the US.</p>\n<p>Charleston wondered if he'd run into Gary Snyder, a local nature poet who had tracked him down a few times asking questions about mystical aspects of Buddhism. Charleston had been annoyed, but swapped stories about some of his more esoteric beliefs. Snyder had mentioned some of his friends, Kerouac and that guy...Gainsborough? Ginsberg.

Temperance called up the box office and, not without trepidation, dropped her mother's name. As a great patroness of the arts, Mrs. Cuevas had a lot of pull; the manager was\xa0<em>happy</em>\xa0to agree to let Miss Murphy come backstage to talk to the singers. He gave her a box seat for the next performance, on October 6.</p>\n<p><em>[Did my research when picking the opera. I tried to find an important but minor role that would suit an up-and-coming young singer...and okay, I'd just seen\xa0</em>Don Giovanni<em>\xa0again at the Met.</em></p>\n<p><em>This was a High Society spend by TP.]</em></p>\n<p>Jean Hewart was tall for an actress; underneath her dark wig her hair was dirty blonde and soaked in sweat. She casually waved for Temperance to take a cup of tea when she came to her dressing room; in the meantime she took off the rest of her costume.</p>\n<p>"You're Ruby's daughter, is that right? Nice to meet you. Yes, I did some acting in the movies, small parts mostly."</p>\n<p>"I was wondering about one called\xa0<em>The Unanswered Question</em>..."</p>\n<p>"Oh my god, that piece of crap? I was young, I wanted to be a film actress. I have the looks, but it's hard to break into Hollywood. You either have to be willing to do something, or know someone. And I didn't, so I came back to singing. And it's gone very well! To be honest, I never thought I'd make it into a major company. I mean, I'm good...but I even while in school I never thought I'd end up here."</p>\n<p>"What was the movie like?"</p>\n<p>"Oh, it was terrible. Well, actually I don't think I ever watched the whole thing. Talbot and Amadou were both crazy. Maybe they're geniuses...I don't know film. The thing is, though, ever since then I've had this powerful artistic inspiration. I took the year off, toured Europe, met some singing teachers. Saw\xa0<em>a lot</em>\xa0of operas. I sang on the streets of Venice, Paris nightclubs...and when I got back to the States, all my auditions went so well. I don't know if it was Amadou...but it was some kind of creative\xa0<em>unlocking</em>."</p>\n<p>"Hannah said something similar."</p>\n<p>"Yes, she called and said you might come. I had some strange dreams myself. Mostly about the King, a still form...but his robes moved without any wind. How did that song Hannah sang go?\xa0<em>Where flap the tatters of the King</em>. Still don't know why they gave\xa0<em>her</em>\xa0the song. Oh, and a great dark city. It was different every time, but I knew it was the same city. And a lake...and the suns setting behind it. It was disturbing. It felt real somehow...almost prophetic. I never felt like bothering Amadou about it. He's a lovely kid\u2014the bent ones always are. I did like him a lot."</p>\n<p>"Have you seen him since?"</p>\n<p>"No, but actually a PI named Tuck came by asking about him. So Dashiell Hammett\u2014appropriate, don't you think? He wanted to know if I'd seen Amadou, or some guy named Bacon. Is there something I need to worry about? Is this about money? If there's a residual I want to know."</p>\n<p>"From what I've heard it's never been released. Just a bit of film history I happened to stumble into."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy went to the address he had for Vince Tuck. It was on a fog-shrouded street down one of \xa0the dark streets of San Francisco. It was also over a Chinese restaurant. He climbed the steps to the office but found a note tacked to it indicating that Tuck had gone fishing for a couple of days.</p>\n<p>Jimmy sighed and fished out his well-worn lockpicking kit. The door was easy to spring, although he scratched up the lockplate. The room beyond was dirty and chaotic. It smelled of stale sweat and drink. Jimmy poured himself a shot from the bottle on top of several folders piled on the desk. There didn't seem to be anything about his case, although there was a map of San Francisco with some pins in it hanging behind the desk. And there was a safe underneath the desk. Jimmy went to work on it, but he wasn't up on post-war models, and he didn't have the right tools to crack it.</p>\n<p>He sighed again and let himself out.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The next morning Candace and Charleston headed down to Pacific Heights to find City Lights. It proved to be a small triangular store on a street corner. Much to Candace's disappointment, Ferlinghetti wasn't in; his assistant Shig Murao was running the counter.</p>\n<p>"We don't carry braille," he said to Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Don't worry about it. I'm with a friend."</p>\n<p>Shig gestured them towards the new editions of Henry Miller and D.H. Lawrence that had come in. Candace asked about Amadou.</p>\n<p>"Amadou Lalin? I know that cat," said Shig. "Haven't seen him around much, he's in and out, but he's in town right now. Hey, I've got it\u2014go to Gallery Six tonight. Bunch of local guys, Snyder, that cat Ginsberg from New York, they're all gonna read tonight. Heard that Ginsberg's been working on something big that he's gonna read from."</p>\n<p>Charleston wanted to know about what was new and hip; Shig told him that most of the "cats" who were doing the really interesting work hadn't been published yet\u2014like Kerouac; he'd read a little bit of some novel he'd written about driving around the country with Neal Cassady that was fantastic.\xa0</p>\n<p>"I dig," said Charleston. "This guy we're looking for made a movie that was never shown."</p>\n<p>"Oh yeah, I heard stories about that thing. Supposed to be really weird. You ever hear of the Asylum?"</p>\n<p>Charleston gulped. "We're new in town."</p>\n<p>"It's a floating party, a real happening happening. They show that film there sometimes, they say." Shig explained that the location changed all the time; the only way to find out the next place it would be at was to find posters with some weird character written on them. People who went to the Asylum didn't seem to have any trouble finding it, but other people didn't seem to be able to find the posters.\xa0</p>\n<p>Charleston got Shig to trace the "strange character" on his hand. It resembled the weird mark they'd found in Nevada. Of course.</p>\n<p><em>[Charleston and Candace both have Counterculture 2, so they didn't have any trouble getting information from a hepcat like Shig.]</em></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459632/#Comment_459632" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-26T18:43:37+00:00" title="January 26, 2017  6:43PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd suspect that if she did have any, it would be a "I've learned to fake it" point.</blockquote>\nYeah -- she reassured the queen with Intimidation last game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459634/#Comment_459634" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-26T19:11:32+00:00" title="January 26, 2017  7:11PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do like the Counterculture skill.

I'm not using Credit Rating in this game (we have High Society and Counterculture, for the 50s that probably works) or in my brand new Tuesday Night Meetup run of Masks of Nyarlathotep--there I replaced Credit Rating with the same 4 Social Class skills from the 1890s Dracula Dossier.

A pall of blue and fragrant smoke hung near the ceiling.</p>\n<p>"We rigged up a sheet like a curtain so we'd know what it looked like," said Van to Temperance. "Mencius\u2014lay down that riff again." Charleston and Candace nodded in time; the bassist was really quite good. Van took Temperance out into the hallway.\xa0</p>\n<p>"Say, do you have any bread so I could rent a piano and have them carry it up here?" he asked.</p>\n<p>"You're going to give the waitstaff\xa0<em>bread</em>\xa0to do that for you?"</p>\n<p>"I don't mean\xa0<em>bread</em>\xa0bread, I mean bread."</p>\n<p>"Cheddar!" put in Charleston.</p>\n<p>"<em>Exactly</em>.

Hey Mencius! That's the name of our number in the third set! Thanks man, that's gone! You get what I'm laying down."</p>\n<p>"Friend of mine was a bandleader, sort of. Back before the war. Makes me old thinking about it," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Where you from? New York? Got a weird accent."</p>\n<p>"I'm a weird guy."</p>\n<p>"Hey, I punched my ticket on that train.

He lurched downstairs to arrange a new room for her.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy was getting ready when he saw Lisa sitting in her room, fidgeting with a newspaper. She looked rather sad and lonely. He fingered the engagement ring he kept in his pocket, and then grabbed Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Let's take her," he said. She shrugged, and went in with him to invite Lisa.</p>\n<p>"I don't know what to wear to a poetry reading," she said.</p>\n<p>"I'm sure it's very artistic," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>And so it proved. Gallery Six was a little hole in the wall place in Pacific Heights. As soon as they came in, they were swarmed with the music and energy of the room. Someone was pounding out jazz on an upright piano in one corner. Cigarette smoke loomed in dusky clouds through the air. Girls with their hair down, wearing slacks and flats or no shoes at all were dancing to the beat.</p>\n<p>Temperance looked down at her nice grey skirt suit and tasteful heels. Lisa blinked behind her glasses and unconsciously smoothed down her cocktail dress. "This is literary?"</p>\n<p>"Oh, yeah," said Candace, bobbing her head to the rhythm.</p>\n<p>"I should have gone to more poetry readings."</p>\n<p>"Hey lady, should I take your wrap?" leered some hipster at Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Thank you, it is very warm. I'll need a coat check."</p>\n<p>Jimmy shook his head, dropped a fin into the "Support our Artists" basket, and led them to a seat.</p>\n<p>Gary Snyder did indeed make an appearance, reading a poem about bears and blackberries. People kept coming and going, and celebrating loudly the lines they liked. One man of about thirty was especially loud; he was swigging from a jug of wine, passing it around from time to time while he shouted loud cries of "Yeah!" and "Go, man, go!" up at the stage. Next to him was a handsome man a few years younger who talked a mile a minute.\xa0</p>\n<p><br/> </p>\n<p>A somewhat nebbishy man with thick black-rimmed glasses made his way to the front. He placed a sheaf of papers on the lectern, and then in a thick New York accent said:</p>\n<p><br/> </p>\n<p>"Howl. For Carl Solomon." He bagan to read:</p>\n<p><em><br/> <br/> </em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,</em></p>\n<em>dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,</em><br/><em>angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,</em><br/><em>who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz...</em><br/><br/> <br/></blockquote>\n<p><em>[Yes, I actually read all that, in the closest approximation to Ginsberg's voice I could manage.]</em></p>\n<p>Temperance looked at Lisa, who was staring with rapt fascination bordering on horror. She realized that she must have something of the same look on her face as well. She tried to take it as well as she could and not let on how un...hip? she was, although the line\xa0</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,</em></p>\n<em>who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,</em><br/><em>who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,</em><br/><em>who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may...</em><br/></blockquote>\n<p>caused her to blink rather hard. One didn't say "genitals" in public, after all.</p>\n<p><em>[I'm pretty sure that my group had never encountered\xa0</em>Howl<em>\xa0before.

Candace was enthralled. She could feel the greatness gathering around the young poet. She snapped her fingers and swayed with the crowd. Behind her, the man with the jug passed it to her. She took a swig.</p>\n<p>"Jack," he said, taking back the jug.</p>\n<p>"Candace."</p>\n<p>"That's my man Allen up there! Hey Neal, groove on this fine chick!"</p>\n<p>"Yes, yass, yes. You are from New York, aren't you. I can tell by the way you look, the direct stare of the New Yorker that cuts like a knife." Neal was the handsome man she'd noticed talking a mile a minute earlier. He turned to Temperance. "And who is this gone cat! Baby, you are a relief. You are all too much a muchly of much. You bring to mind certain Eastern philosophies I had the pleasure of reading once."</p>\n<p>"Any particular philosophies?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Hey, dig. You know in a way, man, I envy you at this moment. Not to belittle what you carry\u2014being blind must be a heavy burden\u2014but to only be able to aurally appreciate what is going on, to feel those vibrations coursing through and the only conduit possible is the purest way to take in poetry! Unless you could find some way to just smash it through your veins on the ultimate kick! My name's Neal Cassady," he said, shaking Candace's hand warmly (and holding on to it a bit too long.)</p>\n<p>"You could just close your eyes. I can't open mine," said Charleston. "Unless they're already open."</p>\n<p>"Tell me, are you all poets?" asked Candace.</p>\n<p>Jack wrote poetry, he said, but he had written a novel\u2014<em>The Town and the City</em>\u2014that nobody had read, and had another one that nobody would publish. Candace commiserated and confidedthat she had written\xa0<em>Homefront</em>, which impressed Jack quite a bit. He'd loved it\u2014it wasn't his thing\u2014but he'd loved it.</p>\n<p>"Let me lay down on you how I wrote my book about me and Neal driving around. I taped typing paper together into one long scroll, and I just typed. I recommend it. Bill, our friend Burroughs, he wants to just cut up what he types and rearrange it at random."</p>\n<p>Temperance was dubious about the technique. "Of course, Bill does do a lot of heroin," said Jack.</p>\n<p>Allen rejoined them. "Well, I hope that went well." He looked wryly at Candace. "Are you here with Jack? Oh, hello Peter." A rather dandyish looking man walked up to him, and they kissed passionately. Temperance looked away.</p>\n<p>"How very European," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"That is a word for it. Well, Jack seems to like you so why not come with us to our favorite place, Langtry Lee's. It's a Chinese place, we can talk more and watch the show."</p>\n<p>"What kind of show?"</p>\n<p>"Um...a female impersonator show, actually. But it's a good bar for people of a certain bend to go to. Squares and straights come too."</p>\n<p>"Would you say of a certain predilection?" said Charleston, trying to leer.</p>\n<p>"Sure. Homosexuals, is what I'm saying. You would prefer I say\xa0<em>artistic</em>? But there are homosexuals who aren't artistic in the slightest."</p>\n<p>Charleston expressed his admiration for the poem; Ginsberg told him it had to come from the heart\u2014that too much of the country had been forced out of sight and he wanted to bring them into the light. It was why he and Jack called themselves\xa0<em>subterraneans</em>.</p>\n<p>"We're working in what Jung would call the gardens of the subconscious," said Ginsberg.</p>\n<p>"I would say perhaps you not below\u2014you're above. You see the whole picture," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"That's exactly right. I've been working on a section of\xa0<em>Howl</em>\xa0about a vision I had of Moloch here in San Francisco after ingesting some peyote."</p>\n<p><em>[Need I mention that, yup, this happened?]</em></p>\n<p>"What he say?" asked Charleston.</p>\n<p>It wasn't so much that Moloch had said anything, replied Allen, but that he existed at all: that the country had become machinery for Moloch, for greed...</p>\n<p>As he was winding down, an rather mousy redheaded woman of maybe twenty or twenty-two joined them. She had sashes of lavender silk tied around her wrists, and Ginsberg identified her as Helen Heck, Jack's friend. Charleston immediately was struck by a sense that something was\xa0<em>wrong</em>\xa0about the girl; without saying a word, he took her hand. He realized then why she had sashes tied around her wrists: she'd slit them both at some point, and hid the scars beneath the fabric.</p>\n<p>"I knew from the moment I saw you that you were something special," he said.</p>\n<p>"It's all like a dream to me here after all," she said, then looked sharply at him. There was an air of being\xa0<em>out of place</em>\xa0around her, he felt. He took her arm as they left the Gallery and wove through the foggy streets.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Langtry Lee's was done up like a Western saloon on the outside, all wagon wheels and hitching posts, save for the Chinese characters in red and gold painted under the sign. Inside it maintained the illusion, with silk wallpaper and brass cuspidors sprinkled around the floor. An elegant drag queen in a cheongsam came out to meet them.</p>\n<p>"Hello, I'm Langtry Lee and\u2014<em>holy hell</em>!" She ran up to Jimmy and embraced him tightly. For a second Jimmy saw a look of fear play over her face, but then she beamed at him. "Jimmy! I'm so glad to see you again."</p>\n<p>"Me too, Lily," he said.</p>\n<p>"Hey Jimmy, that the wife?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"No," he replied, and took her hand as they walked into the dining room.\xa0</p>\n<p>"Joyce!" shouted Lily. "Get these guys a bottle."</p>\n<p>From behind the bar came a very butch woman wearing a vest, black trousers, and a shirt with arm garters\u2014they height of men's fashion in the 1880s. "Holy hell," she whistled. "Jimmy Wright."</p>\n<p>"How do we keep running into each other, Joyce," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"No snakes allowed in here! We let dogs in."</p>\n<p>Betty wagged her tail. Joyce looked over at Charleston. "Oh my god, it's Charles\u2014wait, are you Charleston again?"</p>\n<p>"Who are you?" he said.</p>\n<p>"Remember when our plane crashed?" said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"I need more."</p>\n<p>"In Venice? Joyce Summers?"</p>\n<p>"Don't ruin barkeeping," pleaded Joyce. "I liked planes and boats, so don't ruin running a saloon."</p>\n<p>"Then don't ruin it for us," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>She shook her head. "You all need to get seriously drunk."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459779/#Comment_459779" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-31T17:58:24+00:00" title="January 31, 2017  5:58PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Angels, Demons and Saints (Part 12)</b>\n<p>Helen was a photographer. She felt bad that she couldn't show Charleston her work, but he asked her to describe them to her anyway. She was excited to hear he had lived for a long time in New York.</p>\n<p>"Then you know the old suicide chamber down on Washington Square, the one President Winthrop had built," she said.</p>\n<p>"I'm not familiar with\xa0<em>that</em>\xa0suicide chamber. Give me some details."</p>\n<p>She explained how the Winthrop administration had built a hotel-like suicide chamber during the 1920s. It had been shuttered in the 1930s, but she liked to go inside and explore and take pictures\u2014it was such an interesting, gloomy place. One time when she came out, she met Jack Kerouac, who she knew slightly from Columbia University, although he seemed somehow different. She had followed him out to San Francisco.</p>\n<p>"But of course this is all a dream," she said. "You had some guy named Warren Harding as your President in 1920. You had two wars with Germany but they never invaded New Jersey. This is all a dream."</p>\n<p><em>[Helen Heck is a character from the fine short story\xa0</em>The Neurastheniac<em>\xa0in the collection\xa0</em>Cassilda's Daughters<em>. In the story she was a minor Beat poet, never published in her life, who lived in a New York that must have been descended from Hildred de Castaigne's New York in "The Repairer of Reputations."]</em></p>\n<p>She was from Alabama originally, and attended Barnard, where the stress had driven her to make a suicide attempt. Her conviction that everything around her was some kind of a dream was unshakable. Charleston commiserated about her injuries, mentioning he had scars of his own. He asked for a list of the differences between their worlds; one of the ones she found most perplexing was two-pronged electric plugs\u2014four was so much more sensible.</p>\n<p>Charleston felt something odd whenever Lily came near him: some kind of strange\xa0<em>aversion</em>, something that twigged the ghosts of his\xa0<em>other</em>\xa0senses. He listened to her talk with Jimmy with half an ear.</p>\n<p>"Jimmy! we need to catch up! I heard you died in Peoria, Toronto, and Johannesburg."</p>\n<p>"I think there's at least a dozen other places I'm supposed to be dead," he said with a smile.</p>\n<p>"I missed you! You saved my life. Not like those Krauts didn't beat me up, put me in the hospital, but without you they'd have killed me and all my girls. Of course the bar closed down after that, but I ran into Joyce who had just come into some money and wanted to sell her barge\u2014so we came here, to the States! We have a little house over on Russian Hill. You should come stay!"</p>\n<p><em>[For this history, see </em>Eternal Lies<em> episodes IX and X.]</em></p>\n<p>"Are you sure? Bad things tend to happen."</p>\n<p>"Yes! And it's not like that. I just...want to talk to my old friend tonight."</p>\n<p>Jimmy felt that she was holding something back from him. "You okay?" he said.</p>\n<p>"Oh yes. Well, there's a few things...but I'll tell you later."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance sat fidgeting in a chair. She didn't like Chinese food much. And the...lovely ladies serving it were a constant reminder that she now found herself in a world she never knew existed. It didn't help that Lily kept looking funny at her. Finally she snapped her fingers. "I do know you! You're Temperance, right? Ruby's kid? I knew your mother, back in Bangkok! I have to say, when we met she was a little bit of a mess. But I straightened her out."</p>\n<p>"How?" said Temperance, trying not to bug her eyes out.</p>\n<p>"Gave her a new hairstyle. Jimmy, she still with that really handsome Spanish guy?"</p>\n<p>"They're married now," he said with a smile.</p>\n<p>"Oh. Too bad."</p>\n<p><em>Bangkok</em>? whispered Temperance at Jimmy.\xa0<em>Long story</em>, he whispered back.\xa0</p>\n<p>"Is that why there's a road flare available in every room?"</p>\n<p>"I'm very sure there were multiple things that led to why she keeps a road flare in every room," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"One day, Mr. Wright, we're gonna sit down to coffee and you're going to tell me your\xa0<em>long stories</em>."</p>\n<p>"You have a couple of years?

Lily was charming and effervescent, although still she seemed tinged with some sadness Jimmy couldn't place. Joyce kept up a constant stream of sniping and grousing in the background. They could be an old married couple, except for the fact that they weren't attracted to each other at all.</p>\n<p>Early in the morning, Lily took off her makeup and put on a little tweed suit. She looked smaller and bent; her age showed, and not just because she wasn't made up. Jimmy looked askance at her, and she sighed.</p>\n<p>"Once a week I go to a Buddhist temple to meditate," she began.</p>\n<p>"I can't even look at you when you're like that," said Joyce, emptying out a tea pot and shaking her head.</p>\n<p>"...they're very strict and so I have to go in drag," finished Lily with remarkable simplicity and \xe9lan.

She had no idea young people were like that now; she'd never been that young. She'd wanted to get out and see the world, of course, when she was a teenager; almost left for the big city once or twice. In the end, though, she decided to go to university instead. After all, she was from Manhattan, Kansas, home of Kansas State University.</p>\n<p>"You can always go see the world," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"I did a bit during the war. And Percy was a bit like those young people. Although they seemed joyous in a way he wasn't. And they're all drug addicts."</p>\n<p>"Yes. But a war isn't a way to see the world."</p>\n<p>"I trained as an anthropologist, I could do field work..."</p>\n<p>"Go."</p>\n<p>"Mostly I ended up working on other people's research.

What do you do? Call the authorities?"</p>\n<p>"No. It's like a slow poison. It worms its way in, and the more you share it the more it infects other people. So you have to have strength to deal with it."</p>\n<p><em>[Have I mentioned most of the dialogue is verbatim? This sure was. Bravo, JP.]</em></p>\n<p>"Prophylaxis.

Over time, Charleston\u2014who was hyperaware of the sounds of footsteps around him, began to notice a consistent pattern following them. Whoever it was, he\u2014Charleston had gotten close enough to pick up his cologne\u2014was very good, frequently overwalking them when they stopped to avoid notice.</p>\n<p>"You don't have a boyfriend, do you?" he asked Helen.</p>\n<p>"No. Well, I sleep around with a lot of guys."</p>\n<p>"Any of them the jealous type?"</p>\n<p>"I don't sleep with any of them long enough to know."</p>\n<p>"Let me know when we get to a liquor store." A short while later she gripped his arm and led him through a doorway. He told her to pick up the cheapest bottle of wine available and buy it. Meanwhile he tapped his way to the back of the store and opened the rear door. The store owner began to shout at him in broken English, switching to Cantonese when he saw Charleston's face.</p>\n<p>"Hey, grandpa, help a guy out. I paid," Charleston said in the same language.</p>\n<p>"Stupid kids today! Just get out."</p>\n<p>At the end of the alley he had Helen hail a cab and they rode back to the hotel.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Candace had spent the night with Jack in her hotel room, finishing off a bottle of rye and making love. She dragged herself out of the room around noon and went for a long walk around the city, trying to clear her head and organize her thoughts.</p>\n<p>Somehow she found herself in Union Square. It was bustling with weekend crowds, homeless panhandlers, shrieking children, teenagers dancing to the sound of portable radios. She looked around for a long time, trying to catch sight of anything that might tell her where the Asylum party was going to be held. She had just about given up when a small sign on a movie poster caught her eye.</p>\n<p>She walked up to it. It looked like the symbol they'd seen in the complex in Nevada. It was painted in a fluorescent yellow that seemed to squirm in the sunlight. Chalked above it was an address in the industrial district of the city, and next Saturday's date.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459820/#Comment_459820" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-02T16:37:22+00:00" title="February  2, 2017  4:37PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2017 4:38PM by Aviatrix.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Angels, Demons and Saints (Part 15)</b>\n<p>Temperance dreamed:</p>\n<p>She was standing on the shores of a foggy lake at sunset.

The title's the same, just in French:\xa0<em>L'homme errant au bord du Lac</em>. The wanderer on the shores of the lake. We've got a copy here somewhere..."</p>\n<p>She bought it and took it home; it seemed to be some kind of limited print run\u2014all the copies were hand-numbered. The book was unusual, starting with how it was divided into two acts. Quite a bit was in French, which fortunately she knew. Quite a bit was devoted to this figure Hastur or Kaiwan. There were dreams, and descriptions of dreams, and what could only be called prayers, especially the one at the end:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some would be disconcerted by the structure of this treatise, but it is for us to walk on the Earth in Carcosa: that is the Third Act. That passage may or may not be written.</p>\n<em>Aidez-moi, Kaiwan; moi, le r\xeaveur, \xe0 trouver la rev\xe9lation de l\u2019Ald\xe9baran rouge et du Chali noir. Je fais le Signe.</em><br/>And seeking the vision, he makes the Yellow Sign in front of him with his fist such as I, standing before him, could read it plain enough to Bespeak the End of Day.<br/></blockquote>\n<p><em>[My own translation of the original in </em>Tatters of the King<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: And you get a point of Cthulhu Mythos.</em></p>\n<p><em>TP: Ooooh.

In the evening he sauntered over to the Dragon Gate, the entrance to Chinatown. It was that brief, magic hour in San Francisco when the fogbanks are still poised high on the slopes of the hills and the setting sun is still visible through the Golden Gate.</p>\n<p>As he approached it, he saw Lily wearing a red silk dress walking down the street on the sidewalk opposite him. He saw a little girl point at her, and Lily smile at her. Which is probably what distracted him.</p>\n<p>Someone bumped into Lily, a man wearing a longshoreman's cap pulled low over his face. As he stalked away from her, she slowly collapsed to the ground. Blood began to pool around her. As Jimmy fought his way across the crowd rapidly forming around Lily, he could hear the little girl screaming.</p>\n<p><em>[JP: Why! Whyyyy! Why must you take everyone from me!]</em></p>\n<p>"Call the cops," he shouted as he crouched by her side. Her eyes were closed, but as he knelt beside her and gently propped her up, they fluttered open. She smiled. "I knew this would happen," she whispered.</p>\n<p>"I'm going to get you to the hospital. Where's the nearest hospital!" he yelled at the nearest person.</p>\n<p><em>[CP: Just head this way for two minutes too late, you can't miss it!]</em></p>\n<p>"It's all right," she whispered again, and brushed his face with one bloody hand. Then her eyes closed for the last time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459837/#Comment_459837" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-03T05:00:16+00:00" title="February  3, 2017  5:00AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Poor Lily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459843/#Comment_459843" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-03T15:37:01+00:00" title="February  3, 2017  3:37PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That prompts some notes on the death of NPCs.<br/><br/>In the text, the NPC who dies is a psychiatrist whose job is basically to frustrate people.<br/><br/>That is, he has quite a bit of info to dump but he doesn't give it on his first interview.<br/><br/>Then he gets killed.<br/><br/><i>Then</i> a letter comes to the PCs explaining quite a few things.<br/><br/>So how to map him in?

They loaded her into an ambulance and took her to the morgue.</p>\n<p>He stumbled back through the dark and misty streets to his hotel. As he passed the front desk, the clerk handed him an envelope. His name was written in a scrawled printed hand.</p>\n<p>When he finally got to his room, he ripped it open and read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Dear Jimmy,</em></p>\n<em>I'm sorry I couldn't tell you more earlier, but you see it wasn't time yet.

He was high all the time on something and rambling all the time. Sometimes he would read from his book. He left a copy and I tried to read it but it didn't make much sense.

And I think they are up to something ba. Like the stuff you and Joyce took care of in Bangkok...the things she doesn't talk about.</em><br/><em>I haven't told you about what I saw the last time I saw Amadou. I saw myself walking in Chinatown. It was like a technicolor movie. My dresses have never looked so good. But like a movie I couldn't change anything, just watch. It was near the Dragon Gate. I remember a little girl pointing at me and I smiled at her so I didn't see the man who came up to me and stabbed me.

"Didn't she learn any tradecraft? Stupid old woman."</p>\n<p>Jimmy poured her a drink.</p>\n<p>"Godamnit, Jimmy!" she said. "At least it wasn't a flying snake."</p>\n<p>Jimmy decided not to mention that it was near the Dragon Gate. "No, it was a dagger. I looked away...for a second..."</p>\n<p>"We're all on borrowed time. You, me, Lily. You have to deal with the heebie-jeebies, that's what happens."</p>\n<p>"Things that go bump in the night," he replied and drank. "I hope I never see you again, so that nothing bad happens to you."</p>\n<p>"Skoal."</p>\n<p>"Prost."</p>\n<p>They drank. Joyce slammed down her glass. "We have to give her a funeral, you know. The cops are just a bunch of homophobic assholes. If we let them bury her, they'll bury her in a suit or something."</p>\n<p>"I'll claim the body...and plan the funeral...or scrounge up funds for it."</p>\n<p>"We'll hold some kind of wake here tomorrow." She glowered for a second. "That old woman used to piss me off all the time! How many dresses can one human being own!"</p>\n<p>"I know. I'll miss her too."</p>\n<p>"I really loved her a lot."</p>\n<p>They finished the bottle together.

"She's gonna do something stupid." He went back to the hotel to talk to his friends.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Compton's was a clean enough cafeteria, part of a chain of places strung out across California. Jimmy had no trouble picking out Joyce's crowd; she was standing on a table surrounded by men in neat suits, women in neater suits, a couple of leather dykes, and two outrageous queens in full regalia. "Are you gonna stand for that?" she was shouting in her flat Tennessee twang. "Killing us on the streets? Hey, Jimmy." She hopped off and explained they were planning to have a service and concert/rally that weekend in Golden Gate Park; Van Carlyle was going to play.\xa0</p>\n<p>"We should find out who did this, because the cops don't care," she said. "Ain't you a private eye?"</p>\n<p>"It's been a long time since I was called that. I have a lead. Little girl in Chinatown saw the whole thing."</p>\n<p>"What are we getting involved in?" Charleston asked Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Investigation. Whoever killed Lily was involved with some guy named Lawrence Bacon..."</p>\n<p>"No. What are you going to\xa0<em>do</em>\xa0when you find him?"</p>\n<p>Jimmy didn't say a word. But his face grew grim.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The way you find someone in Chinatown, Charleston told them, especially among the immigrant community, is to find the big man. And since he was the only one even remotely conversant in Cantonese, it fell to him to do the negotiations. It took him a day or so, but he finally uncovered the guy he needed, a restaurant owner named Wu. "We're looking for a friend. We don't know their name, we don't know what they look like, and we don't know where they are. But they killed a lady the other night."</p>\n<p>"Oh yeah, the [slur] who got killed. I heard about that."</p>\n<p>"This\xa0<em>fair lady</em>," said Charleston with emphasis, "got bumped off and we want to make contact."</p>\n<p>"Wasn't my people. She paid up her protection money. Seems to me you want the girl who saw the knifer. I can send you to them. You're looking for the Chens over near Stockton. I hear you screwed with them, we're going to have a discussion."</p>\n<p>"I'm a harmless old man!"</p>\n<p>"I know old men, not all of them are harmless. Chiang Kai-shek wasn't harmless!"</p>\n<p><em>[This was a Streetwise spend by CP.</em></p>\n<p><em>CP, to JP: You're totally old man Logan!</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: I just saw that trailer! And wait...travelling the country with a disabled man...that means you're Professor X.</em></p>\n<p><em>CP: "Logan, it's not too late..."]</em></p>\n<p>The Chen's apartment was a tenement populated by immigrants who only spoke Chinese languages. They walked up to the third floor, and Charleston knocked on the door. It opened a crack. "Who are you?" demanded a man's voice.</p>\n<p>Wu sent us, said Charleston in his most pleasant voice. He said you could help us. Told us not to make any trouble. We're not going to make any trouble for you, you're not going to make any trouble for us. A friend of ours sadly passed away yesterday. Your daughter is the only one who saw what happened, and we want to her to help us identify them.</p>\n<p><em>[Me: You have Reassurance? You sound reassuring.</em></p>\n<p><em>CP: Nope.</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: ....oh okay, you\xa0</em>think<em>\xa0you're being reassuring...]</em></p>\n<p>What poor Mr. Chen heard and saw, however, was a blind, scary looking man with three Anglos behind him talking about their local protection racket chief, saying how there wasn't going to be any trouble, and talking about his daughter. Thoroughly shaken, he opened the door.</p>\n<p><em>[Me: Spend a point of Intimidation. This will be a different interview now...]</em></p>\n<p>Charleston led them inside. "No tea?" he said in his pleasant voice. Mrs. Chen leaped to her feet and ran over to make a pot of tea. She eyed Temperance's cross necklace warily and hoped that she wasn't here to take their daughter away.</p>\n<p>Julie Chen was a precocious girl of about eight, her hair tied up in pigtail braids. Candace knelt down. "You speak English? Good! We're not here to hurt you. We just want to find out what the man who hurt our friend looks like."</p>\n<p>Julie nodded. Candace handed her a crayon and some paper, and took notes from the girl's description--long nose, dark eyes, scar on his lip. Soon she had a passable verbal sketch of the man.</p>\n<p><em>[Criminology use here; Julie was pretty talented and was able to give good details. I used Joaquin Phoenix from\xa0</em>The Master<em>\xa0as the image for this guy.]</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy frowned as Julie recounted her story. Whoever this guy was, he had decent skills at getting gone; he figured he must be some kind of second-story guy. Tracking him down might be harder than he thought...unless he could get him to come to them...</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460198/#Comment_460198" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-13T21:38:29+00:00" title="February 13, 2017  9:38PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does google image search on Joaquin Phoenix in that film....<br/><br/>Yeah, definite Heavy material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460224/#Comment_460224" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T16:58:49+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  4:58PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: You Want It Darker (Part 1)</b>\n<p>They returned to their hotel, walking past the room that Van had taken over with his trio. He waved wildly at Temperance as she walked past, hunching her shoulders. She came to her room.</p>\n<p>The door was ajar.</p>\n<p>"I've been told of things like this," she said to herself. She retreated to Jimmy's room and walked in without knocking.</p>\n<p>"Mr. Wright," she said, "it's happened."</p>\n<p>Jimmy looked askance.</p>\n<p>"My room's been tossed." She noticed the look of relief, worry, and resignation that tracked across his face in that order. "I think they are still in there. What do we do? I don't want to hurt anyone...I don't want to be hurt..."</p>\n<p>Jimmy sighed, went into the bathroom, and yanked the shower curtain rod free, letting the curtain cascade to the floor. He collapsed it down to about three feet, clubbed it like a truncheon, and walked with Temperance back to her room. They pushed it open.</p>\n<p>Two men in black suits were tossing the drawers of Temperance's dresser. They both stiffened and straightened up simultaneously as soon as the door opened. One reached smoothly into his coat pocket and pulled out a badge and ID card. "We're with Security," he said.</p>\n<p>"Whose Security?" said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"That's not for you to know. You're not cleared for that...Mr. Wright."</p>\n<p>"Why are going through my room?" blurted Temperance.</p>\n<p>"That's not for you to know either," said the other suit.</p>\n<p>"It's my room! I pay taxes!"</p>\n<p>"It's not your concern."</p>\n<p>Jimmy narrowed his eyes. Their skin was very pale and they moved in a way that seemed...odd. For a second, he remembered the two agents who had tossed poor Mr. Jennings almost through the wall of his trailer back in Nevada...</p>\n<p>"I'm sure you don't want to be in trouble," said the first suit. "Mr. Lamp, are we done?" he said to the other suit.</p>\n<p>"We're done, Mr. Window," he replied. The two of them marched out of the room. Mr. Lamp bumped into Jimmy with his shoulder. "Be seeing you...Mr. Wright."</p>\n<p>"What do we do now?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Look for something that's missing," said Jimmy. He left her to spend the rest of the evening in paranoia and rode the elevator down to the first floor. The clerk at first thought he was complaining about the noise, or the busted ice machine.</p>\n<p>"No, the guys in black suits," said Jimmy. "Called themselves security."</p>\n<p>Nobody came in but guests, the clerk told him. Jimmy asked about any other entrances, and with a sigh he told him where to find the fire door. Jimmy couldn't find any sign of tampering.</p>\n<p><em>[JP: Hey, I guess I\xa0</em>could<em>\xa0be a building inspector.</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: For all we know, that was one of your odd jobs you had, until you found out the super living in the basement had a kid in hock to the Mob and then you had to fix that and finally walk off to the sound of sad piano music...hey, I wanna see that webseries.</em></p>\n<p><em>This was 1 point of Stability loss to Jimmy, and 2 for Temperance, since the \u201cagents\u201d had their weird paws all over her stuff. I had been looking forward to bringing in my somewhat idiosyncratic ideas about the Men in Black to the game.]</em></p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Thoroughly unnerved, Temperance spent a couple of days running down the story Sol Molinari had told them in Savannah. There was indeed a Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign, with some shadowy connection to the Vatican, although it seemed to be dormant. Likewise, Drakmar was a real place, an unusual rock formation of striated rocks that had Buddhist shrines nearby. The other members of the expedition were all real people, and all listed as dead.\xa0</p>\n<p>She found one other curious thing: the cover of the book\xa0<em>Diametrics</em>\xa0that the Neurotologists used depicted a mountain with a red star hanging above it. It didn't take her long to figure out that the mountain was Drakmar, and the star Aldebaran.</p>\n<p>She decided that it might be worth paying a visit to the San Francisco Neurotology office.</p>\n<p><em>[TP was fishing for Stability here. This was Occult and Research, mostly; a 2 point Outdoorsman spend would have gotten her a connection to the sherpas on the '29 expedition!]</em></p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Candace appointed herself the task of finding the occult bookstore owned by Lawrence Bacon. Unfortunately, she didn't know its name, didn't know where it was except for "somewhere in Pacific Heights", and there was no Lawrence Bacon in the phone book. She took Charleston down to City Lights to talk with Shig Murao again.</p>\n<p>"Wow, you guys again?" he said as they came in. "I mean, customers! Maybe you'll actually buy a book this time."</p>\n<p>"Did you get any in Braille?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Maybe you'll buy one," said Shig to Candace. She grabbed a copy of\xa0<em>Howl</em>\xa0by Allen Ginsberg; it was hot off the presses. She asked Shig about occult bookstores in Pacific Heights. Any that were\xa0<em>particularly</em>\xa0strange.</p>\n<p><em>[Me: Allow me to introduce myself: my name is Charleston Chiu, master of the weird.</em></p>\n<p><em>CP: ...weird New Jersey!]</em></p>\n<p>"The Dark Mare," said Shig. "It's really more of an occult store--antiquities, curiosities, that sort of thing. Not all that great, kind of out of the way." He wrote down the address on the back of a business card for them.</p>\n<p>The store, such as it was, was actually a house on a pleasant Italian neighborhood. Candace and Charleston walked up and rang the bell. \xa0Several times. Finally a man opened the door a crack.</p>\n<p>"Yes?" he said. He wore an elegant Imperial beard and mustache that was mostly grey.</p>\n<p>"May we enter?" said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Do you have an invitation?"</p>\n<p>"I didn't know--" But the door slammed in her face.</p>\n<p>Charleston rattled the door. It opened up a crack. "I think I might have heard of you, sir,\u201d said the man through the door. \u201cIf you are who I've heard of, there's no way I'm letting you in." He slammed the door again.</p>\n<p>Charleston tapped on the door with his cane for several minutes, using all his considerable powers of annoyance (and they were\xa0<em>considerable</em>; he'd once managed to annoy an Outer God.) Finally he gave up and asked Candace about the buildings on either side; they were San Francisco Victorian houses.</p>\n<p>"Should we do a stake out?" she asked.</p>\n<p>"I'm not much use on those," said Charleston. "But I have a certain set of skills. If we can't get past\xa0<em>this</em>\xa0door, we can see about getting access to one of the houses on the either side...and then get in through the upper floor of this house."</p>\n<p>"You want to break in?"</p>\n<p>"No, I want\xa0<em>us</em>\xa0to break in."</p>\n<p>Candace wasn't sanguine about their chances, with her inexperience and Charleston's disability. What do you think will happen? she wondered.</p>\n<p>Something interesting, said Charleston, but she remained unconvinced about the break-in. Finally she suggested talking to the neighbors before moving on to felonies.</p>\n<p><em>[Me: The problem is that Charleston doesn't have an angel and a devil on his shoulders, he has a devil and a Cthulhu.]</em></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460231/#Comment_460231" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T19:52:45+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  7:52PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Devil: Do it!

This was a modest store front in an expensive neighborhood in the financial district. Inside it looked like the waiting room for a doctor's office. "My name is Delia. How may I help you?" asked the receptionist, a pretty woman in her 20s.</p>\n<p>"My name is Candace," said Temperance, internally wincing at telling a lie. "I was at a soiree the other night and I heard people talking about the wonders of Neurotology..."</p>\n<p>"Oh, it's a wonderful way to improve your memory, and your physical capabilities--kicks psychotherapy into a cocked hat as far as I'm concerned."</p>\n<p>Jimmy let them talk while he cased the place. Hanging on the wall was a photograph of an intense man with curly hair and a thin mustache--N. Quincy Lund, he assumed.</p>\n<p><em>[My picture for him was of Orson Welles in\xa0</em>The Stranger<em>.]</em></p>\n<p>Temperance told Delia she wanted to get a general feel for Neurotology. Delia told her to buy the book,\xa0<em>Diametrics</em>; Temperance bought two, one for her "uncle" Jimmy. Together they cost $10, which was outrageous. Delia offered to have her husband come down to talk to them; Temperance tried to beg off, saying she had a gallery opening, but Delia told her they had so many interesting people who came in, poets, artists, poets who were also artists...</p>\n<p>"Have you ever heard of Amadou Lalin?" said Delia.</p>\n<p>"Ye--no," said Temperance, changing her answer when Jimmy kicked her.</p>\n<p>Delia, flattered, told them about the very\xa0<em>artistic</em>\xa0Mr. Lalin and also mentioned that there was a prominent doctor--a psychologist--who was also a member. Temperance pressed her for a name...Delia resisted for a moment but eventually said it was Dr. Edwina Montague.</p>\n<p>"What's your names, so I can tell my husband you're here?" said Delia.</p>\n<p>"Edward McCoy," said Jimmy. "What's involved in meeting him?"</p>\n<p>"We have a process called Debriefing. We get you talk about past traumas and we use very sensitive electronic equipment to monitor your responses to see when your traumas fade. It's part of our program, the Drama of Thought--where we use Diametrically Opposed Therapy to treat each stage. We call it 'following the DOTs'."</p>\n<p>A man came into the office, shrugging into a suit jacket. "Didn't know anyone was here," he said, "Especially such a lovely young lady. Peter Morrison." He picked up the clipboard. "Mr. McCoy? Why don't you two come back to my office."</p>\n<p>His office was a professional looking wood-paneled space, with bookcases full of what Jimmy suspected were fake books. He sat them down and began his hard pitch, going over the levels or "Acts" of DOT: starting with the Audience, DOT 1, moving--provided you attended the classes and paid for the materials--to DOT 2, also known as Act One. And then--</p>\n<p>"Well, there's levels beyond that, but you need to be in the program," he concluded smugly.</p>\n<p>"I have some questions," said Jimmy, and then proceeded to aggressively challenge Peter on every point. Soon they were screaming at each other.</p>\n<p>"You're not ready to pierce the Waves of Mist at DOT 4 and move on to Act Three! Because then you'd have Gone Quiet. Then you'd be a Silent! And there are only a few, and I've met them all! I've met Dr. Montague! I've met Mr. Bacon! They are so far\xa0<em>beyond</em>\xa0you. Their powers are superhuman."</p>\n<p>"Magic," smirked Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Science," said Peter with gritted teeth. "You'll have mental powers that are inconceivable for you, since you're not even DOT 1."</p>\n<p>Jimmy demanded proof. Peter demanded a reading, and fifty bucks. Jimmy persisted in his skepticism, so Peter unceremoniously chased them out.</p>\n<p><em>[This was an Interrogation spend by JP.]</em></p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Charleston and Candace knocked on the door of the house on the right of the Dark Mare bookstore. A pleasant young Italian-American woman opened the door. "Can I help ya? You guys lost or something? Oh, I already got a laundry."</p>\n<p>"My boss Mr. Jefferson does the best in the city," said Charleston, rolling with it. "We're looking for a bookstore--"</p>\n<p>"Right next door. The creep. Lorenzo...Lawrence, I mean. He speaks wonderful Italian. Says he's from England...I think sometimes he sounds a little Milanese. Maybe it's because I don't like Milanese; my dad was from Abruzzo."</p>\n<p>She explained that he mostly kept to himself except to shop at the local Italian groceries. According to Bacon, he'd learned Italian while studying in Florence. She also talked down about Michael, Bacon's shifty looking handyman. Candace kept her chatting long enough to match his description to what Julie Chen had told them.</p>\n<p><em>[Reassurance spend by CP, because poking too hard in a close-knit Italian neighborhood needed a spend to get anything other than a slammed door in the face.]</em></p>\n<p>They tried the house on the left-hand side, but the woman in it had three kids and no time.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460269/#Comment_460269" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T17:41:25+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  5:41PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Delia was flattered because they hadn't heard of Lalin?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460270/#Comment_460270" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T17:45:38+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  5:45PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That does read funny.

To his surprise, he heard the door unlatch. He trudged up the stairs to the office and shoved his way inside. Tuck, a harassed-looking balding man closing on fifty looked up from behind his desk. "Oh,\xa0<em>you</em>," he said with a sigh.</p>\n<p>"Yeah. I want to know what you found out. What you paid to find out."</p>\n<p>"Well, the thing is--" he began. They both heard the sound of a board creak out in the hall. The blood drained from Tuck's face and he turned with wild eyes on Jimmy. "You brought them here! You're with them!"</p>\n<p>"No I am not," said Jimmy. At that moment two men in black suits suddenly appeared by the stairwell. They looked uncannily exactly like the two men he'd seen in the hotel. "I'm Mr. MacAdam," said one. "This is Mr. Asphalt. We're with Security."</p>\n<p>"How good are you at jumping out of windows?" said Jimmy to Tuck.</p>\n<p>"Not!"</p>\n<p>"That's unfortunate," said Jimmy, grabbing him by the arm and plunging through the window.</p>\n<p>They fell hard, but the office was only on the second floor and even with his advanced years Jimmy still knew how to take a fall. He came up bleeding and with something grating in his shoulder. Tuck was rolling on the sidewalk. "I think I broke my leg," he moaned.</p>\n<p>Mr. Macadam--or was it Mr. Asphalt?--looked down on them from the window, his face a waxen mask totally devoid of emotion. Jimmy pulled Tuck to his feet and they hobbled over to the curb and hailed a cab.</p>\n<p>They took refuge in a bar. "What did you do to me?" groused Tuck into his rye whisky. "I mean, I was at Guadalcanal, I saw some stuff...but this thing..."</p>\n<p>He ran down the points. Lalin was shacked up with some creepy guy in Pacific Heights. (Tuck was not happy about having had to troll the area gay bars.) He'd seen Michael Coombs there too a lot.</p>\n<p>"By the way, you could have mentioned that this might be a\xa0<em>government project</em>\xa0you set me on," continued Tuck. "Now I got these creepy agents after me! This kid Lalin worked for the Feds on some secret project, testing bombs, who knows what this TAROT was..."</p>\n<p>He'd managed to track down Carl Simon, Lalin's colleague at TAROT who now wrote a weird newsletter. He showed Jimmy a letter Simon had sent him:</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Dear Sir,</em></p>\n<em>\xa0</em><em>I received your letter with great interest. \xa0It seems you have begun to unravel some of the mysteries surrounding my past activities.</em><br/><em>\xa0</em><em>About them I can only say at this stage of our correspondence that I regret some things but others were wondrous. \xa0A new world was revealed to me and I have been awed and cowed by its revelations.</em><em>\xa0</em><br/><em>As far as your current investigations go, I can provide this information: \xa0there is a man in the city of San Francisco who goes by Lawrence Bacon but I have it on good authority that he is in fact Lorenzo Pancetti, a member of the 1929 Italian expedition to Nepal. \xa0I am sure you have heard of it by now. \xa0Do not be fooled by his current appearance, I am definite that he is the same man. \xa0He owns a small bookstore in Pacific Heights called the Dark Mare. \xa0</em><br/><em>\xa0</em><em>Be careful around "Bacon". \xa0He is accompanied by a man named Michael Coombs, a man of vicious and brutal nature. \xa0If you seek to confront Bacon, I suggest neutralizing Coombs by distracting him. \xa0He is an alcoholic and while he struggles to control himself he remains susceptible to the lure of the bottle.</em><br/><em>\xa0</em><em>Be wary of Bacon. \xa0He long ago gave himself up to madness and his abilities are not to be taken lightly. \xa0</em><br/><em>\xa0</em><em>After that . . . well, I'm sure you will figure it out. \xa0You'll see the connections. \xa0When you want to talk again, post a classified in the Rocky Mountain News and then watch for a reply. \xa0It will have contact instructions.</em><br/><em>\xa0</em><em>Good luck and I hope to speak to you again soon.</em><br/><em>CS</em><br/></blockquote>\n<p><em>\xa0</em></p>\n<p>Tuck then began a rambling discourse on how he'd trailed Lalin and Coombs whenever he could. ("You're Jimmy Wright, ain't ya? What happened to you, I heard you were dead.") One night Lalin met with a couple of other people: a curly headed middle-aged man with a mustache, Coombs, and a red-headed lady who had some kind of accent, Irish or Scottish. Lalin liked her for some reason.</p>\n<p>Tuck began to sweat so Jimmy ordered another round of doubles. One night, said Tuck in fits and starts, he'd followed Bacon out of his house. He'd gone down to the docks on a foggy night, hanging around until he found a wino passed out in a doorway. Bacon did some weird movements with his hands while saying words in some foreign language.</p>\n<p>"That wino, he just\xa0<em>died</em>," said Tuck. "Not like dropped dead either, like he aged fifty years in a second. And when I saw Bacon walk by, he looked younger somehow! How is that possible!"</p>\n<p><em>[Me: What did you get me into! I don't have PC levels of Sanity!]</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy advised him to take another long fishing trip and paid him off.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Charleston was very interested in hearing about Bacon's ability to drain vitality. "Nosferatu?" he asked.</p>\n<p>"Had coffee with one in Vienna after the war. No, I think he did some magic," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>Charleston knew the spell; it haunted his thoughts. "You shouldn't believe a word of it," he said, coughing a little bit in a futile attempt to get Jimmy off the subject in front of Temperance.</p>\n<p><em>[Cthulhu Mythos use here by CP.]</em></p>\n<p>"One thing is clear," he continued. "This Coombs living at Bacon's house? Amadou's boyfriend? He's the one that killed your friend Lily."</p>\n<p>Jimmy pondered this for a while, then slipped out to a local Army-Navy store. "I'm looking for something in a knife. Something big," he said.</p>\n<p>"Got a Japanese sword bayonet," said the clerk. "GIs bought a ton of these back from the Pacific. Need anything else?"</p>\n<p>Jimmy decided to cover up his purchase by picking up a bunch of surplus equipment--a sleeping back, some rope, K-Rations, and a medical kit.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460314/#Comment_460314" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T15:00:15+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  3:00PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/><b>Episode III: You Want It Darker (Part 4)</b>\n<p>Saturday was another beautiful day in San Francisco: mild temperatures, and after the fog lifted, a cloudless sky. Lily's memorial service was being held near the Japanese Tea Garden.</p>\n<p><em>[In fact, it's where the AIDS Memorial Grove will one day be.]</em></p>\n<p>The size of the crowd took Jimmy by surprise; either Lily had been more popular than he knew, or Joyce was good at organizing protests. Probably both. They'd set up a temporary stage and Van and his bandmates were there, alternating between bop takes of spirituals and genuine gospel songs. Joyce had brought along some of her very butchest friends to run security. "Be easier if we had motorcycles," she mused in Jimmy's earshot. "Maybe we could form some kind of club..."</p>\n<p>Lily's ashes were inside a lovely Chinese urn on a pedestal on the stage. "You wanna say something?" asked Joyce. "People are saying things, if they want."</p>\n<p>"I'm no good at it," Jimmy said, tight-lipped. He kept scanning the edge of the crowd to see if Coombs, like so many murderers, would be looking in on his victim.</p>\n<p>There! At the edge of the crowd, under the cover of some trees, he picked him out. He didn't look unhappy. Coombs looked up and caught his eyes. For a long moment they stared at each other. Then Coombs turned and ran.</p>\n<p>Jimmy cursed and hopped off the stage, running for the woods. Temperance came aside of him, panting to keep up. "You need my help to find him," she said. Jimmy swore silently, but she was right: he'd already lost the trail.\xa0</p>\n<p><em>[Jimmy has no Surveillance, but Temperance does.]</em></p>\n<p>"Where is he?" he said.</p>\n<p>"You are only going to detain him, right?"</p>\n<p>"I will detain him."\xa0<em>I'm going to immobilize him. By nailing him to a tree with this bayonet...</em></p>\n<p>"I'm trusting you," she said miserably, and then led Jimmy around the edge of the woods; she'd already spied his escape routes and took the best choice.</p>\n<p>But they were just a bit too slow: they saw him dash out from under the trees and out to the street, where he hoped on a bus that had just pulled up.</p>\n<p>"Oh," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>Jimmy screamed and punched a tree. "I just found out something," he said, eyes tearing up. "I\u2019m almost sixty." He moaned with pain and cradled his hand in the crook of his arm.</p>\n<p>"Not going after him?" said Charleston, huffing up. "Look at you, bawling your eyes out, gripping your bayonet.

Temperance opined that it looked like the set of a film noir movie.</p>\n<p>"That's because they're filming a movie," said Jimmy, pointing to a bunch of guys setting up a shot. "Hey, you, want to be an extra?" one them shouted at him.\xa0</p>\n<p>They pushed on until they found a large warehouse. It loomed over them, black and silent, and it had that air of emptiness and wariness only abandoned buildings have. They filed inside. There was nothing they could see--no glimmer of light other than the scatter from the lone streetlamp outside--but after a moment they could hear the faint sound of music coming up from the basement. They walked down a dingy concrete staircase until they came to a heavy steel door. A Judas window opened in it. "You here for the Asylum?"</p>\n<p>"Yeah, man," said Candace, with a wink. The door opened up. A dubious looking man with a scraggly beard and a black vest looked her over and whistled, and then frowned. "Who's the squares?" he said, nodding his head at Lisa and Temperance.</p>\n<p>"They're cool, man," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"All right, all right, and your blind friend is our kind of weird. Come on in, the water's fine."</p>\n<p><em>[Counterculture was the governing factor here: you need Counterculture 2+ to get in, but you could spend (at 1 point per person) to bring in people with Counterculture 0, and Counterculture 1 Investigators could spend to "piggyback." Also, given the weird nature of the place, Cthulhu Mythos 2+ got in for free.]</em></p>\n<p>Inside the basement had been transformed into a large cabaret-style nightclub. There were little tables gathered around a couple of different performing areas; a wooden bar set up in the center of the room; and some quiet nooks for canoodling. The walls were covered with tapestries and old movie posters. A band was playing the hardest bop jazz with a driving rhythm.</p>\n<p>Candace was hopping with excitement. "Wait \u2018til I tell Vlad about this." Temperance stared around with a frown. "A lot of disreputable people here."</p>\n<p><em>[2-point Stability loss here for Temperance; basically I charged 2-Counterculture to everyone.]</em></p>\n<p>The focus of the room was a large stage with some elaborate cardboard sets being rigged up on it. A movie screen hung behind it, and there was a space for a small orchestra to play. It clearly looked like where the evening's main event was going to take place.</p>\n<p>"Wow, I can totally tell you're an artist, ain't you?" a man wearing a rather unusual assortment of clothes--velvet smoking jacket, khaki fatigue pants, and a too-small trilby said to Candace. "Let me see\u2026poetry...no...prose. You're a novelist."</p>\n<p>"Wonderful powers of detection," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Not me," said the man, holding up a little vial. "It's the Yellow. I'm Nick."</p>\n<p>"What is that?"</p>\n<p>"It's the Yellow...if you're creative, it inspires your\xa0<em>true\xa0</em>art. We got a whole room set up," he said, guiding Candace toward the back, where she could see a large studio with easels and desks with typewriters. Several people were working furiously inside it, with looks of intense concentration. From what she could see of the paintings, they looked very good.</p>\n<p>"Everybody here has some Yellow. Here, have some. I don't know how you take your kicks, but injecting gives you the longest one. Snorting gives you a sharp kick but it slacks off suddenly..." Nick led her to a table near one of the performance stages.</p>\n<p>Jimmy was following her with his eyes when someone plopped down next to him at the bar. He was wearing longshoreman's clothes\u2014pea coat, watch cap, and tar covered dungarees. "You're an artist, I can tell," he said without preamble. "Your art is your\xa0<em>life</em>. Have some Yellow." He slapped a little envelope on the countertop and walked away.</p>\n<p>Everyone avoided Temperance; she was far too square. She felt a little tinge of envy; she was actually a skilled restorer of paintings, but had never felt that she had any\xa0<em>real</em>\xa0creativity.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Charleston was tapping his way through the crowd. His cane smacked into someone's ankle. "Sorry, excuse me..."</p>\n<p>"Teach us, guru," said the man.</p>\n<p>"Oh no, not you guys!"</p>\n<p>"We can tell what you are. Teach us. Tell us about the King. Take our Yellow. Bless it for us. Let your artistry escape."</p>\n<p>Soon there was a small but tight-knit knot of people around Charleston. He tried to ignore them and insult them, but they seemed to think that he was being gnomic. "Who's coming tonight?" he asked one.</p>\n<p>"Amadou's coming...but there's a bunch of other poets first. Helen Heck is going to read." Whoever he was talking to slipped him a little vial of Yellow. With a sigh, he tapped out a little on the back of his hand and then rubbed it on his gums.</p>\n<p>At first, he felt the lassitude of an opium high. He sank into a padded armchair, and sighed contentedly. He felt marvelously at\xa0<em>peace</em>\xa0for the first time in a long time. And gradually, through the fog and mists, the room swam into focus, filtered through his now-open Third Eye. Reality quivered around him. For a second he felt that he could step through it and into dreams...but something pulled him back. A surge of creativity. A strong desire--a compulsion, really--to make\xa0<em>art</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[Here are the effects of The Yellow:</em></p>\n<p><em>The primary effect of Yellow is to make the user fall first into a listless, relaxed state that gradually makes them completely insensible to their surroundings. During this time, fantastic dreams and visions occur. These generally are a\xa0<strong>2-point Stability loss</strong>. However, if a user makes a spend of\xa0<strong>Art</strong>,\xa0<strong>Pharmacy</strong>,\xa0<strong>Chemistry</strong>, or\xa0<strong>Occult</strong>\xa0after taking their first dose of Yellow, they may increase their\xa0<strong>Cthulhu Mythos</strong>\xa0score by +1 (one time only).</em></p>\n<p><em>\xa0</em><em>After this phase (which lasts from 30 minutes to two hours), the user will suddenly find them plunged into a period of manic creativity.</em></p>\n<p><em>\xa0</em><em>The mechanical effects of Yellow are as follows:</em></p>\n<p><em>\xa0</em><em>Users receive a dedicated Art pool equal to 1d6 -3, minimum 1.</em></p>\n<p><em>Users receive an urge to create Art, at least one point a day, with an appropriate amount of time spent, until the pool is exhausted.</em></p>\n<p><em>Resisting this urge is a\xa0<strong>Stability Test against a Difficulty of 4</strong>. Failure results in the spend of an Art point on pointless parodies of art: hypergraphia, painting endless series of monochrome canvases, singing the same uninteresting twelve tone row over and over again, etc.</em></p>\n<p><em>A user may spend a point of\xa0<strong>Sanity</strong>\xa0to fully refresh their\xa0<strong>Stability</strong>\xa0and two other Investigative skills. If they do so, they\xa0<strong>must</strong>\xa0rewrite one statement.</em></p>\n<p><em>A user with\xa0<strong>Cthulhu Mythos</strong>\xa0may make\xa0<strong>a Test with a difficulty of 5</strong>\xa0to enter the Dreamlands, or their 1950s periphery: the Interzone, the Raketen-Stadt, the Socialist Utopia, Main Street USA, etc. The user may spend\xa0<strong>Cthulhu Mythos</strong>\xa0or\xa0<strong>Stability</strong>\xa0on this test.</em></p>\n<p><em>...and of course there are side effects, but we'll get to that in a bit.

Around her the revels swirled, but she was at a loss on how to join in, or if she even wanted too.</p>\n<p>Another woman sat next to her. She was wearing a fashionable, if slightly tight, grey skirtsuit. She had blonde hair and was wearing a pair of black patent leather spiked heels. "This your first time?" she asked, placing a hand on Temperance's arm.</p>\n<p>"I've been to other...meetings before."</p>\n<p>"This is nothing like any other party. I'm Susan."</p>\n<p>"Temperance."</p>\n<p>"That seems appropriate. You want a drink?"</p>\n<p>"Water...or...I should loosen up a bit. Champagne, or maybe a nice white zinfandel..."</p>\n<p>"Two whisky sodas," Susan said to the bartender. "Temperance, you're at the Asylum. You're gonna need to..." she reached up and pulled out the comb holding Temperance's hair in a bun. "...loosen up." She slid a little vial full of yellow powder across the bar at her.</p>\n<p>"I can see it in your eyes," said Susan, staring intently at Temperance. "You've never let yourself really go and let your creativity flow. But I can see you have depths...you have amazing eyes, by the way. And the Yellow will help."</p>\n<p>"What is it?"</p>\n<p>"It's a drug. When you take it, it will break the shackles that hold your creative mind back."</p>\n<p>"Is it like...<em>reefer</em>? I saw a movie about that, and it didn't look good..."</p>\n<p>"No, this works best if you inject it."</p>\n<p>"Is it an opiate?"</p>\n<p>"I don't know what it is. But I'm on it now. Look, if you really don't like needles, you can ingest it. The Edwardians over there--" Susan nodded to a table with men dressed up in the height of velvet-bowed foppery--"like to mix it with absinthe or laudanum, for maximum antique authenticity."</p>\n<p><em>[A bit of an anachronism, but there really was an Edwardian fashion moment in San Francisco during the early '60s.]</em></p>\n<p>"They serve\xa0<em>absinthe</em>\xa0here?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Charlie, get me an absinthe," said Susan. The bartender got out his works--flame, spoon, sugar cube, ice--and began making the drink.</p>\n<p>"What is it you do?" asked Temperance. "Are you a poet? An actress?"</p>\n<p>"I'm an actor, yes. Not in movies yet. I do a lot of performance art."</p>\n<p>"You have the face to be in movies."</p>\n<p>"That's so sweet of you, especially coming from such a beautiful girl." She smiled wide.</p>\n<p>"Such friendly people here!" muttered Temperance.</p>\n<p>The bartender passed over the absinthe. "Let me help you with this," said Susan. She dumped the Yellow into the pale green drink and took a long sip. Then she kissed Temperance full on the mouth.</p>\n<p>Temperance slapped her. "Worth it," said Susan, rubbing her jaw, as Temperance fled into the crowd looking for Jimmy.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"So when are you going to tell me what you're\xa0<em>really</em>\xa0about," said Helen to Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Where are you from, Helen?"</p>\n<p>"I told you, I'm from the real world."</p>\n<p>"You miss it?"</p>\n<p>"It was up and down. Your world is up and down. Our world never pulled of anything as destructive as the two wars you pulled off. But you have jet planes. And...there's something wrong with my world, I think. A shadow on it."</p>\n<p>"I...I'm really fired up to do something I haven't in years," said Charleston breaking into a sweat.</p>\n<p>Charleston stretched out his arms, and then swept her up and laid her on top of the bar. "Here? All right," said Helen, reaching up to unhook her bra.</p>\n<p>Charleston ripped her dress open from throat to navel. He smashed a glass on the bar, then took a shard and cut his hand open. With the blood flowing from his wound, he began to trace weird symbols on Helen's skin. "I used to dabble a bit in art myself," he said to the crowd that had gathered around them. "I made something once. Something really beautiful...it got away from me a little bit. But I can't get these symbols out my mind..."</p>\n<p>Charleston was so intent on what he was doing that he didn't notice that he had started to\xa0<em>levitate</em>\xa0next to the bar. He was busy tracing out horoscopes on Helen's flesh: two separate horoscopes that merged together at one point. He reached out to open her mind: if this worked he'd be able to connect it with her own world, let her communicate...</p>\n<p><em>[I pulled out the magic "rules" I had used for Millicent Lowell in the Eternal Lies campaign, so this was a General Test that you could spend Cthulhu Mythos on; CP spent 3 and rolled a 5. But the Difficulty was 6...which provoked a 3-point Stability loss...]</em></p>\n<p>Helen began to scream, scream like her head was being crushed. Jimmy came pushing through the crowd and took it all in one sweep: the naked woman, the hieroglyphics, the\xa0<em>levitating man</em>.</p>\n<p>"Levitation. Again," said Jimmy with a grimace. He cold-cocked Charleston, who suddenly came to himself. He crashed to the floor and pulled himself up, smearing a bloody handprint on Helen's stomach. "Oh, that's not good," he muttered.\xa0</p>\n<p>Helen kept screaming. Temperance, who had just arrived, grabbed someone's beer and splashed it on Helen, erasing even more of the bloody symbols. Helen began to convulse.</p>\n<p>"I need something to get her out of this!" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Here's some heroin!" said a woman, shoving her works at Temperance. She took them limply, with a look of shock on her face.</p>\n<p>Jimmy grabbed them out her hands, and expertly tied off a vein in Helen's arm and injected her with the smack. She began to calm down and fell into a slumber. Some men helped Jimmy take her to a quiet room with some other people who needed to come down a bit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460517/#Comment_460517" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-22T04:38:05+00:00" title="February 22, 2017  4:38AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Millicent magic.

It reaches out to you, through the universal cosmic oversoul."</p>\n<p>"I found it. Well, it found me."</p>\n<p>"Exactly. Hey Nick, give me some Yellow. I'm interested in many chemicals," he said with a glance at Candace, "but this has proven to be very effective for my art."</p>\n<p>"Is Jack coming?"</p>\n<p>"He doesn't usually come to these things. He came a few times, but he was so inebriated that he passed out before the show began. He did tell me about you, he said he enjoyed your company very much and that you were a gone chick and really with it."</p>\n<p>"Very kind of him."</p>\n<p>Ginsberg waved somebody over. "Amadou! Come here and meet our friends."</p>\n<p>A thin, slight man, elegantly dressed in a chalk stripe suit with a foulard scarf wrapped around his neck, approached the banquette they were sitting on. He had a cafe au lait complexion, and his long hair was pulled back into a ponytail. His eyes were dark and sensual and looked almost as if they were rimmed with kohl. But there was something absent about them, something far away, something seeking but never finding. He moved gracefully and had an ethereal quality, and a soft, lilting voice.</p>\n<p><em>[I used Jaye Davidson as the portrait for Amadou.]</em></p>\n<p>"Hello...I am Amadou...Lalin."</p>\n<p>"Candace Heartbrooke. I'm an author."</p>\n<p>"I write poems...and plays. And sometimes I paint."</p>\n<p>"I read one of your poems. It was wonderful."</p>\n<p>"I haven't published any of them, how did you read it?"</p>\n<p>"Allen gave it to me."</p>\n<p>"Oh, Allen, you've been naughty again. What was it about?"</p>\n<p>"A place..."</p>\n<p>"Carcosa? I write about it a lot.\xa0<em>Parlez-vous francais</em>?"</p>\n<p>"<em>Un peu</em>."</p>\n<p>"Have you seen Carcosa?"</p>\n<p>"No."</p>\n<p>"Are you staying for my show? Then you'll have a chance...oh, Michael." Amadou waved languidly to a man standing near the stage. He had the desperate strut of a wounded gamecock, and he looked around him with a sneer that seemed etched into his face. "That's my friend Michael," said Amadou. "He's not a very nice man but I like him." He lightly touched Candace's face. "You're an artist but something is holding you back...you haven't accomplished what you want to accomplish. I felt that way too...for a long time. I met a man who helped. A great man, a good man. I think he's dead now. His name was Percy. I loved him in my own way. He showed me Carcosa. And then I understood how to fulfill my art. Soon I will fulfill it. Soon, very soon, I will walk the streets again."</p>\n<p>"You're working on a masterpiece?"</p>\n<p>"To say the least. It's not quite ready yet. Soon, very soon. I will do it for my friends who want me to do it. And I will stay where I want to be. Not this poor world, but a better world, a more beautiful world. I'd love to show it to you one day. Perhaps you see it tonight. If you wish, take the Yellow while you watch it. Most people find it a very engaging experience like that. I have to go now."</p>\n<p><em>[I was channeling some Andy Warhol here.]</em></p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance sat glowering at the bar. "I had to give it to her to calm her down," Jimmy said.</p>\n<p>"Heroin!"</p>\n<p>"Did you have anything better?"</p>\n<p>"I splashed her with beer to wake her up! Don't they have a first aid kit? Look, they've got a fire extinguisher...oh wait that that's conceptual art."</p>\n<p>"Didn't you learn anything from Murphy about being ready for things?"</p>\n<p>"Mostly the Colonel taught me about containing the collateral damage." She sighed. "Look, there's a string quartet...with a singer...I think the show is going to start soon."</p>\n<p><em>[In fact, I played the Schonberg 2nd String Quartet here; it was the opening act, and I started it at the line "I feel the air of another planet..."]</em></p>\n<p>They made their way to the main stage area. Candace had grabbed them some seats and she waved them over to her. There was a furious circle of activity going on at the stage: a guy was loading a projector, some men were putting on costumes (mostly togas, it seemed), and some women in dance tights were stretching out.</p>\n<p>"I want to\xa0<em>see</em>\xa0this performance," said Candace to Ginsberg.</p>\n<p>"Of course, we all come here for it. The performance is usually amazing. I'm really not sure where Amadou is going, but it gets more elaborate every time. The film is very interesting. Shame he never got a chance to show it the way he wanted to before."</p>\n<p>Amadou suddenly strode onto the the stage. He stood in the spotlight, swaying a little, as the string quartet continued to play softly. He ran his hand over his forehead, leaned on the microphone stand, and without looking up began to recite. "Cassie...oh Cassie I can't see you anymore but I know you're out there somewhere. I'm waiting to see you again and I'll see you soon. Being locked here is so inconvenient. It means I can't finish my work yet. I can't go to where I want to go. I have to write honestly. I have to show you honestly what I'm doing. You have to open your mind and your eyes to see what is\xa0<em>out there</em>. A bigger world, a greater world, beyond the Pallid Mask, beyond the Lake and its beauty..."</p>\n<p>He swayed forward for a second and righted himself. "Edie said I can only work with her but I'm going to go beyond\xa0<em>everything</em>. Oh...is Barbara still out there? Is she still calling for the King? Has she brought him here yet? I can't sense it. Have you seen it? The Yellow Sign? Have you seen it yet? Edie and I will soon be done. I will walk my streets again. Yes. Maybe you'll see it too. Maybe you'll find it."</p>\n<p>He collapsed and the lights went out. And then the film started...</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460584/#Comment_460584" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T16:32:58+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  4:32PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: You Want It Darker (Part 8)</b>\n<p>Later, when they talked about what they had seen, they felt that the movie was much better than the small portion they had seen from it before: Temperance (disdainfully) and Candace (excitedly) recognized the heavy influence of German Expressionism on the sets and lighting design. But there was also something else, a bit of the\xa0<em>fin de si\xe8cle</em>\xa0melancholy of the Decadents mixed in--a strange but thrilling combination of doom and anticipation.</p>\n<p>The film had been shot in black and white, but in places the frames had been hand colored to bring out different moods. Candace, who had snorted some Yellow right before the film began, was deeply inspired by the artistry of the movie. It was clear to here that all the effects had been done "in camera" which bewildered her because some seemed impossible to achieve. Jimmy was convinced that the film was an elaborate attempt at steganography, although what the message being hidden was he could not say.</p>\n<p><em>[Photography for the effects, Cryptography to pick up the steganography.]</em></p>\n<p>The plot was hard to follow, or at least hard to keep in their heads, and at one point their recollections of the film diverged wildly. Lisa made a point of compiling their versions of what they had seen and typed them up for the notes she was keeping:</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p><strong>Act One</strong>\xa0</p>\n<p>In the first act, a young poet encountered a woman wandering in the desert. He took her with him to a large building that she referred to as a castle. There she was introduced to the others, whom she invariably gave royal titles. Most of the other characters seemed to think she was mad, but the poet had clearly fallen in love with her.</p>\n<p>In Scene 2, the woman, who is addressed as \u201cCassie\u201d, sang a lovely song about a strange realm called Carcosa. Excited, the poet decided to use her stories as the theme for a masked ball that evening. As the ball began, a strange man in a white mask appeared; no one seemed to know him, but Cassie and a young woman from the \u201ccastle\u201d tried to speak with him. Their confusion suggested they thought he was the poet, but much to their surprise he suddenly appeared as the clock approaches midnight. \u201cWho are you, really?\u201d he asked Cassie, but she turned away, distracted, as the Stranger approached.</p>\n<p>Midnight struck. Everyone unmasked but the Stranger. Cassie and the other woman, Camilla, demanded that he follow suit. He claimed not to be wearing a mask, which terrified Camilla; then he raised his arms, and the Yellow Sign blazoned on his robes was fully visible. The screen went black for a long time, over a minute; because of persistence of vision, the Yellow Sign seemed to linger in the air long after the screen had gone dark.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p><strong>Act Two</strong></p>\n<p>Cassie\u2014or Queen Cassilda, as the poet had taken to calling her, identifying her with one of the characters in her stories, fled the \u201ccastle\u201d and headed for a city. The location shots are of an unidentified American city that seemed cut out of a thick block of Film Noir: shadowy alleyways filled with fog, flickering neon, strangers with hidden faces pursuing them through the night. They went to a nightclub. The poet tried to kiss Cassilda, but she gently and distractedly put him off. Suddenly they realized that the music has stopped and the other patrons were no longer talking; instead, they were looking expectantly at the door to the nightclub. Slowly they turned their gaze to Cassie and the poet; except now they were suddenly all wearing masks.</p>\n<p>The door opened. There was a glare of light. A figure stepped into the nightclub. He was surrounded by a harsh nimbus of light that made it difficult to see any details other than he was very tall\u2026</p>\n<p>They each had different recollections of what happened next:</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p><strong>Temperance's Impression of Act Two, Scene 3</strong></p>\n<p>The Stranger walked in. The poet did not notice him at all. The Stranger took the hand of Cassilda, who was frozen in fear and shock, and silently handed her a pair of masks. Gently, lovingly, she placed one of them on the poet\u2019s face, and then covered her own face with the other. In an extreme closeup, viewers saw tears welling out from the eyeholes of the mask\u2026but the eyes behind them were harsh and somehow not human\u2026</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p><strong>Candace's Impression of Act Two, Scene 3</strong></p>\n<p>The Stranger appeared and walked right past Cassilda, who seemed not to notice him. He helped up the poet, who had fallen to his knees, and they both turned toward the figure in the doorway. The Stranger whispered, \u201cThe King!\u201d and the poet nodded mutely. The music rose to a triumphant, religious tone as the King extended a long-fingered hand at the poet, who wept tears of joy\u2026</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p><strong>Charleston's Impression of Act Two, Scene 3</strong></p>\n<p>The poet fell convulsing to the floor. The Stranger appeared, grabbed a shrieking Cassilda by the neck, and threw her down at the feet of the figure in the doorway. She rose to her knees. \u201cWhy, O King?\u201d she moaned.\xa0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have sent thee the Yellow Sign. And it calleth thou home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will never return to Carcosa,\u201d she said with desperate intensity.</p>\n<p>\u201cThinkest thou that thou hast left? Look thou out upon our realm of Carcosa. Thou mayest never leave her until we shall step down from red Aldebaran and the Hyades shall give up their secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cassilda shrieked, and with a final lunge she pushed through the doorway and into the streets. The King\u2019s mocking voice followed her as she dashed from corner to corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cThou canst never leave. We shall give no leave to do that which is forbidden to ourselves. Upon thee shall fall the same fate as us. Forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot upon us, O King!\u201d Cassilda wailed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Forever.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot upon us!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Forever.</em></p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p><strong>Jimmy's Impression of Act Two, Scene 3</strong></p>\n<p>The figure raised one bony hand. Both the poet and Cassilda fell to the ground, shrieking and convulsing. The Stranger appeared. Slowly he removed his mask. The face behind it was inhuman, unspeakable, and blasts itself from the memory of anyone who saw it; it was impossible not to turn away in horror. The next time the viewer looked at the screen, Cassilda and the poet, both wearing masks and dressed in white robes, were being carried in biers by people wearing vaguely medieval costumes. The music was low and funereal; this was clearly a cortege of some kind. They approached a cemetery in the twilight. The procession paused in front of a massive marble tomb and waited as the light slowly grew stronger.</p>\n<p>There was a cut away to the sun rising over a misty lake. As its rays touched the masked face of Cassilda, the Stranger appeared. He took her hand and she stepped down from the bier. She led the cortege down from the tomb as the poet stumbled off his own bier and fled in the opposite direction\u2026</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460585/#Comment_460585" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T16:34:01+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  4:34PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Episode III: You Want It Darker (Part 9)\n<p><strong>The Final Sequence</strong></p>\n<p>The poet was pursuing Cassilda along a sandy beach. Both were naked. Shreds of mist washed over them. The poet caught up to Cassilda and tackled her. They rolled around on the ground, fighting and scratching, until he locked his hands around her throat. He crouched over her, choking the life out of her, until at almost the last possible moment he released her and rolled away, weeping. She slowly lifted herself into a crouch, too exhausted to try to flee.</p>\n<p>Still lying on his back, not even looking at her, the poet once again gasped out, \u201cWho are, you, really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho am I, really,\u201d she repeated to herself. \u201cReally, who am I. Am I? Who? Am I\u2026real\u2026\u201d\xa0</p>\n<p>She stopped and gazed out at the camera. Something sparkled out of the frame, casting a play of light across her face.</p>\n<p>The camera pulled back and both characters look out at the same object, slowly revealed by the camera\u2019s motion: a battered diadem or crown, washed up in the waves lapping the shoreline. The poet and Cassilda slowly stood and held hands, looking out across the water as the sun rose, washing everything with a bright glare. The film began to be tinted yellow as the camera panned up to reveal a\xa0<em>second</em>\xa0sun hanging angrily in the sky above the one rising over the horizon. The yellow tint got more and more intense until the entire frame was a pulsating, sickly chromium yellow. The film abruptly cut to black and the soundtrack stopped.</p>\n<p>There were no credits.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>They all sat stunned as the lights came back up. Their minds reeled from the burning symbol--the Yellow Sign--that seemed to hang lack an afterimage in the air before their eyes. Candace and Temperance both felt that it was the finest work of art they had ever seen in their lives. They had cried during the movie without even noticing.</p>\n<p><em>[2 points of Stability loss for seeing the Yellow Sign; the opinion of the film's quality is likewise a side effect.]</em></p>\n<p>Charleston recovered first. Still high on the Yellow, he didn't even notice that he was able to see around him (after his own fashion). With a sudden shock he realized that there was no way for either the King or the Stranger to speak with all their masks and prosthetics on, yet their lines--which hadn't been wildtracked in--were articulated clearly.</p>\n<p>Temperance stood up and gave a solo standing ovation. Around her, the crowd began to stagger away in pairs or larger groups for the quieter areas of the room. They room pulsed with musky desire.</p>\n<p>Helen leaned on Charleston's shoulder. "Oh, you saw it?"</p>\n<p>"Yes. Not sure how."</p>\n<p>"You want to have sex?"</p>\n<p>"Yes, I think that's for the best."\xa0</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Susan walked up to Temperance, still standing alone, and hugged her. "Are we feeling better?"</p>\n<p>Temperance clutched her crucifix. "I'm fine." There was finality in the air.</p>\n<p>Susan sighed, and turned to Candace. "Well, how about you, toots?"</p>\n<p>Candace looked at her steadily. "Sure, why not. Jack's not here."</p>\n<p>Temperance spluttered. "That doesn't mean you go with Jill!" she shouted as Susan led Candace away by the hand.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Lisa was sitting in stunned silence. Jimmy moved over next to her. "Mr. Wright," she stammered. "I...don't know why but I feel like you should know what to do. It was so beautiful..." He took her elbow and maneuvered her to the bar, where he ordered a couple of stiff drinks...and then another couple after that.</p>\n<p>"This is what came of TAROT," he said.</p>\n<p>"Was Percy involved?"</p>\n<p>"I don't know, but it resulted in this."</p>\n<p>"But it was so beautiful..."</p>\n<p>"Beauty is only skin deep."</p>\n<p>"You mean like in Rilke? \xa0'Beauty is only the beginning of terror.'"</p>\n<p>Jimmy shrugged. "Whatever made it wasn't beautiful," he said.</p>\n<p>"Anthropologically it was an interesting document...but I'm just a girl from Kansas, I don't know about this kind of thing."</p>\n<p>"I don't know what to do most of the time. But I just\xa0<em>do</em>. I move. I try. And eventually things get clearer."</p>\n<p>"That sounds like an interesting life. When I was a little girl I used to think about doing stuff like that. I was going to be an adventurer, like in the film reels. Am I doing that now, Mr. Wright? You tell me, you're the boss."</p>\n<p>Jimmy clenched the letter in his pocket. "No I'm not," he said softly.</p>\n<p>"Where are you from, Mr. Wright?"</p>\n<p>"New York."</p>\n<p>"I like New York. I worked there for a little bit during the war. It's kind of ironic, actually, you being from New York, because of where I'm from. A college town in Kansas called Manhattan."</p>\n<p>"Small world. We should probably get back, get some rest. Don't worry about the others," he said, casting his gaze around, "they'll be fine."</p>\n<p>He helped her put on her coat. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Amadou get corralled by Michael Coombs and a couple of guys in bad suits. They were pushing him toward the back door, but it was taking them a while.</p>\n<p>Jimmy didn't even think. He raced over to the front door, ran through it, and then took the stairs two at a time back to the ground level. He skidded across the dusty concrete floor of the warehouse to the back entrance, dashed through it, and stopped in the middle off the alleyway behind the warehouse, facing the basement service entrance. He heard the door slam behind him and Lisa and Temperance clattered down the stairs. He motioned them into the shadows.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460662/#Comment_460662" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T16:55:59+00:00" title="February 24, 2017  4:55PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: You Want It Darker (Part 10)</b>\n<p>The service door burst open, and a knot of men shuffled through it. Jimmy edged forward into the glare of the streetlight. A light rain was falling, and tendrils of mist curled around his feet. Amadou lolled in the grasp of the two men in suits; Coombs looked up and barked at Jimmy, "What the fuck do you want?"</p>\n<p>Jimmy stared.</p>\n<p>"I don't have time for this," said Coombs. He and the others began to drag Amadou up the ramp from the basement door and into the alleyway. Jimmy didn't move a muscle. Coombs stopped short and caught Jimmy's gaze. The ghost of a sneer flitted across his face. "Boys," he said. The goons pulled out snub nosed revolvers.\xa0</p>\n<p>"We don't want any trouble," said Coombs. "You don't want any trouble. What are you gonna do?"</p>\n<p>"You killed her," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Killed who? I killed a lot of people in the war."</p>\n<p>"You made one mistake. You killed my friend. Lily."</p>\n<p>"Who, the homo?"</p>\n<p>Jimmy growled. He braced off his back foot and lunged at Coombs, who was already drawing his rather nasty looking commando knife. Jimmy cracked his forearm against Coombs' wrist; there was a sharp crack as the scabbard of the bayonet he'd concealed up his sleeve smashed into hard bone. Coombs screamed and dropped his knife.</p>\n<p>One of the goons fired his pistol. Jimmy danced back and the bullet smashed into the brick wall behind him.</p>\n<p><em>[Quick analysis: this was an Athletics test to get in range before Coombs could cut Jimmy (he's an experienced knife fighter and letting his opponent attack first is one of his tricks.) JP got a total of 8, which let Jimmy claim an extra benefit in my house rules; that was how the disarm happened. The goon fired back and hit Jimmy, but as long as the target\u2019s Health stays above zero I usually treat damage like that as near misses.]</em></p>\n<p>Temperance pulled out the little gun from under her shoulder blades and fired two shots in the air. Everyone froze. The icy rain ran down her neck and she shivered. One goon dropped into a shooter's stance and shot back at her. She slipped up against the wall, breathing heavily.</p>\n<p><em>[Good idea by TP, until I asked if Temperance had any Intimidate; she doesn't. So in this case even though the gun was scary, I ruled that without Intimidate the goons would realize she didn't want to kill them and they started shooting back. This is a nice example, I think, of making abilities count even in their absence.]</em></p>\n<p>Coombs lunged for his knife. Jimmy danced toward him but then saw the goons taking a bead on Temperance. He turned on them and growled like a Burmese tiger: "I have no business with you. Go!"</p>\n<p>They took one look at him and began running up the alley, dragging Amadou with them. Temperance waited until they passed her, and then sped off in pursuit.</p>\n<p><em>[2-point Intimidate spend by JP. I gave Jimmy back 2 points of Stability because staying to fight Coombs was hitting his Duty drive.]</em></p>\n<p>Coombs swept up his knife and stepped back, whipping it in front of him. "This how you want to go out? Dying for that [slur]? Fine. I'll kill you too."</p>\n<p>Jimmy screamed and lunged in, bringing the knife down in an overhand feint before flipping it over in his hands and ducking under Coombs' block. He slashed through his jacket, coming within a hair's breadth of impaling him.</p>\n<p>Coombs grabbed Jimmy's arm and spun him away, slashing out with his knife as he did. Jimmy felt it tear into his side just below his floating ribs and grimaced in pain. He backed up and felt the wound. His hand came away very bloody.</p>\n<p>"Who the FUCK ARE YOU!" shouted Coombs.</p>\n<p>"Your worst nightmare!"</p>\n<p>"Who <em>says</em> things like that? We can drop this right now. We don't have to do this anymore, none of us is too banged up."</p>\n<p>Jimmy narrowed his eyes and bulled in, stabbing wildly, but even in his winded state the younger Coombs was able to dodge. He stabbed Jimmy under the ribs again. Jimmy stumbled and slid to the ground. Coombs kicked him in the back. "I'll kill you like I killed that bitch!" he said as Jimmy struggled to get up. He sank to his knees, staring dead-eyed ahead of him.</p>\n<p>Coombs circled around behind him. He smirked as he walked up to grab Jimmy by the hair and cut his throat. Jimmy kept staring forward. As Coombs wrapped his knife hand around his neck, Jimmy's left hand flashed out and grabbed him by the wrist. He pulled Coomb's arm down and forward, yanking him off balance while his right hand jammed his knife backwards into Coombs' torso. He felt the point, which he had spent all afternoon filling to needle sharpness, strike home. Coombs stumbled back, pulling the knife out of Jimmy's hand.</p>\n<p><em>[And JP challenges Jimmy's Duty Statement "Ugh, here I go again!" by breaking his promise to Temperance. The Health and Weapons refresh was enough to do Terrible Harm on Coombs.]</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy slowly stood up. One sleeve of his jacket had been ripped off the shoulder. He walked over to Coombs. He grabbed the handle of his bayonet, still stuck in Coombs' chest, and gave him a sharp kick to pull it free. Blood spurted from the wound, and he could hear the sucking sound of air rushing in. Jimmy looked around for a moment, then scooped up Coombs' knife and slipped it under his coat.

Up ahead was Market Street; she reached it just in time to see the two suits pile themselves and Amadou into a cab and speed off.</p>\n<p>She froze in frustration for a moment, until another cab rolled up. "Hey, toots, need a ride?" asked the cabbie.</p>\n<p>"Yeah," she said, climbing in. "Follow that car!"</p>\n<p>"I always wanted somebody to ask that," said the cabbie, turning on the meter and gunning the engine. "You do this kind of thing a lot?"</p>\n<p>"No, just been a hell of a night," moaned Temperance. "No judgments, but you wouldn't happen to have a flask on you?" The cabbie grinned and slipped her a pint of bourbon.</p>\n<p>They followed Amadou's cab up Market and then along Broadway. It soon was clear they were headed to Pacific Heights. Finally the cab stopped outside a rather dismal looking house. Temperance hadn't seen it before, or the man who came out to the car, but she knew where she must be: the Dark Mare bookstore. The man must be Lawrence Bacon. She stopped the cab a few blocks away and then hurried back to the house, keeping in the shadows on the other side of the street.</p>\n<p>Bacon helped the goons carry Amadou into the house. Edie Montague came out onto the porch, wrapped in her cardigan. "Ah, Amadou," she muttered. "Take him upstairs, I'll be up in a minute." Bacon closed the door behind her and she stood for a while in the misty night, smoking.</p>\n<p>"All right, lassie," she finally said, flicking her cigarette into the street. "Come out into the light and let me see you."</p>\n<p>Temperance froze as Edie walked down from the porch and stood under a streetlight. Then she \xa0stepped out herself into the light of another streetlight, a few lampposts away from Edie.</p>\n<p>"What are you here for?" asked Edie.</p>\n<p>"Curiosity, mostly," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Ah, curiosity? Let me show you something curious then." Edie pulled a straight razor out from under her sweater, where it hung from a cord. She flicked it open, and then made a clean cut down the back of her forearm, a broad slice like peeling an apple. She shook the flap of skin off her arm and it fell to the street. Blood glistened black under the yellow glare of the streetlight. Temperance could see the skin already begin to reknit on Edie's arm.</p>\n<p>"Come here and let me show you how I did that," said Edie.</p>\n<p>Temperance backed up slowly. Edie put her head down and ran at her. Temperance watched her blink in and out of sight as she raced through the circles of light cast by the lamps. She drew her gun and dropped into shooter's stance, waiting...waiting...and firing as Edie dashed through the last circle of light. It struck the Scotswoman center mass and\xa0<em>she didn't stop running</em>\xa0and Temperance turned to run and Edie kicked her leg out from under her and the razor flashed down and carved a square of skin off the back of her hand...</p>\n<p>Edie stopped. She looked at the back of her own hand. She flicked out the razor again and sliced an identical patch of skin from it. Temperance remembered through her shock how when Miss Yates had died, there had been enough blood for two bodies; now she knew why.</p>\n<p>"I always found the fascia of the hand interesting in anatomy class," said Edie. "That was a guid hit you gave me there, girlie. I almost felt it." Temperance could see the blood staining Edie's blouse.</p>\n<p>She kicked off her heels and jumped up, running for her life. She could hear Edie following close behind.\xa0<em>Maybe regeneration causes the lactic acid to not build up as fast</em>\xa0thought Temperance, somewhat hysterically, as she ran. She ran and ran, down the quiet streets, always hearing the other woman close behind.</p>\n<p>Suddenly she saw a cab up ahead. She ran up and yanked the door open. It was the same cab as before; he'd been circling to find another fare. "Hey, toots--holy hell!" he said when he saw Temperance's bleeding hand.</p>\n<p>"Drive! Drive!" gasped Temperance. The cabbie looked up and saw Edie running down the street. "Does she have a razor?" he said. Then he threw the car into gear.</p>\n<p>Sam--that was his name--drove Temperance to the hospital, and then stayed there waiting for her to come out of the examining room. A big patch of gauze covered the stitches the doctor had put in. He offered her a cigarette, which she took gratefully. "Gosh, I'm sorry ma'am. Let me take you back to the hotel." She smiled blankly.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy and Lisa raced through the streets. He grabbed her to slow her down. A police car, sirens blaring and lights flashing, sped past them.</p>\n<p>"Mr. Wright--you did that--for your friend--I..." She grabbed him and kissed him on the mouth.</p>\n<p>"I'm sorry," she said as he pulled gently away. "I mean...is this what it's like...my goodness, you're bleeding! You need to get to a hospital."</p>\n<p>"No hospital," he panted. "Just go back to the hotel." She nodded and went to flag down a cab.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, she'd learned some emergency medicine when she'd been overseas; that was how she\u2019d met Percy, helping victims at the site of a V-2 strike. When they got back to the hotel she dug around the military surplus Jimmy had bought and came out with the first aid kit. She stitched up Jimmy\u2019s wounds in his room. They weren't as serious as she feared, although she wished she could do more than give him some sulfa and slap a compression bandage over the stitches.</p>\n<p>"I'm going to go wash all the blood off my hands," Lisa said.</p>\n<p><br/> "It does come out," said Charleston as he stepped out of his room. He was wearing a dressing gown, adding an incongruous touch of class to his weathered frame.</p>\n<p>"Mr. Chiu, can I ask you a question?" said Lisa.</p>\n<p>"I'll allow it."</p>\n<p>"You seemed to respond to the film as if you were watching it."</p>\n<p>"Is this really the time for that question?"</p>\n<p>"I'm covered in Mr. Wright's blood, so maybe."\xa0</p>\n<p>It was of course at this moment that Temperance arrived, leaning on Sam the cabbie's shoulder. "Holy cow," he said when he saw Lisa. "What are you people\xa0<em>up to</em>? Serves me right for pulling an extra shift in my brother-in-law's cab." A groan and a howl came from Jimmy's room, unnerving Sam, although it was only Betty jumping up on his stomach.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance collapsed into her bed, the whisky sloshing unpleasantly in her stomach. She was unconscious almost as soon as her head hit the pillow. And she dreamed:</p>\n<p>She was back on the street in front of Lawrence Bacon's house. Edie was frozen in place behind her, razor blade out, trailing drops of blood that hung uncannily in the air. Standing next to her was Charlie, smoking a cigarette.</p>\n<p>"I have only one question," she asked him. "Am I going to have to kill someone?"</p>\n<p>"You don't\xa0<em>have</em>\xa0to kill anyone."</p>\n<p>"Can I do this? Will doing this help other people survive?"</p>\n<p>"Maybe. Little Miss, you've never killed anyone. I have. Interesting. That looks like an Unspeakable Possessor you've got here. Tough draw for your first. Enjoy yourself...but not too much."</p>\n<p>"I don't like some of the things I've found out about..." said Temperance. She turned around and saw Susan standing there. She shrieked and woke up with a start.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Charleston walked into Jimmy's room, sniffing. "Smell of blood...the sound of Jimmy chugging whisky...did you get him?"</p>\n<p>"Yes," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Fine work. I'm sure your friend, wherever she is, probably doesn't give a damn. But it helps put a bookend on things for you."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460762/#Comment_460762" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T22:01:04+00:00" title="February 27, 2017 10:01PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Millicent will be glad Jimmy got the thug.

His hands shook, but he tried to shrug it off. For a while he drew endless looping doodles on a notepad, until finally his head cleared.</p>\n<p><em>[When a Yellow user's Art pool--the temporary pool granted by the Yellow and her own Art pool if any--is exhausted, then it's a Difficulty 4 Stability Test to avoid taking it.

CP added a secondary Drive here, "Addicted to the Yellow."]</em></p>\n<p>Candace, on the other hand, woke up inspired. As if her head had cleared overnight, she suddenly had her next novel in her head--like all she needed to do was type it out...</p>\n<p>Throughout the day the only thing anyone heard from her room was the sound of rapid-fire typing.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>She took a break in the afternoon to go with Temperance to see if they could dig anything up on Bacon from her writer friends. They found Neal Cassady and Kerouac in a bar near City Lights. Jack was already three sheets to the wind, and it was still early in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>"Ah, the fair Temperance and the fair Candace: two names that rhyme, there's an assonance and dissonance of consonants and vowels..."</p>\n<p>"Yes, yes," said Temperance. "Listen, we had an inspired evening, Amadou is a genius. We want to see it again."</p>\n<p>That could be a problem, Neal said. Around dawn the cops had found a body in the alleyway behind the warehouse the party had been held at--some cat named Coombs, Amadou's boyfriend, had been brutally murdered. The cops had raided the party and arrested a lot of people; Amadou wasn't one of them, but nobody knew where he was.</p>\n<p>He asked Candace how her work was going, and was happy to hear that she had started her novel. "Inspired by Jack, or by Amadou?"</p>\n<p>"By all of you," she said.</p>\n<p>Neal was happy to hear that. Some people, he said, only had one great work in them; some, like himself perhaps, had none. But Amadou had\xa0<em>two</em>\xa0works in him, he thought. "He's definitely a cat who is somewhere other than else," he concluded sadly.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>When Temperance came back to the hotel, she went to Jimmy's room to change his dressings. He looked at her warily as she put her Bible down on the nightstand. He grimaced as she stripped off the bandage and cleaned the suture site--although in truth she was very gentle. She finished re-bandaging him, and then put a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>"I think there are enough monsters in the world," she said. "We don't need any more."</p>\n<p>She left without waiting for a reply. Without taking her Bible with her.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Helen dropped back in on Charleston. "What did you do?" she demanded.</p>\n<p>He lit a cigarette. "I had a selfish thought."</p>\n<p>"What a surprise."</p>\n<p>"I thought I could solve your problems by giving you the ability to do things that I knew how to do. But if I'm being honest,\xa0<em>I</em>\xa0just wanted to do the things I knew how to do. I wanted you to be able to hear from where you're from."</p>\n<p>"The real world."</p>\n<p>"Let's put that aside and just say you're not from around here...what you need is what I always wanted, a little bit of agency over your life. But I think I messed it up."</p>\n<p>Probably, she said. She'd heard strange piping and danced for a while around some kind of swirling chaos. Then she'd met someone, an Arabic-looking girl with thick glasses. The girl had told her that Charleston was doing his best but not doing things well. That he had stopped asking for help...and that she knew Charleston and was going to see him again soon. "She did tell me something," finished Helen. "She told me how to do what you were trying to do. And that you were probably regretting a lot of things that you did because you hadn't listened to her."</p>\n<p>Charleston lit another cigarette. "I guess it's true about good intentions. There's a saying about that. Wish I could remember it."</p>\n<p>"So you want to do it again sober?"</p>\n<p>He sputtered. "You want to try that\xa0<em>here</em>?"</p>\n<p>"Not the magic! I didn't come here for no reason."</p>\n<p>He grinned.

Father Vic, the priest, one of those bright-eyed young men, was happy to talk with her after mass, although he had a different idea about why this serious and apparently devout woman wanted to talk to him.</p>\n<p>"Are you considering a vocation in the church?" he asked after the pleasantries were over.\xa0</p>\n<p>"I actually work with the church," said Temperance. "I've thought about becoming a nun, but I'm not sure I'm interested in secluding myself."</p>\n<p>Not all orders were cloistered nowadays, Father Vic gently reminded her, and they broke into a discussion of the neighborhood: the excellent Italian food, the fresh fish caught by the boats that still plied the harbor. Temperance, remembering going grenade fishing with Colonel Murphy, smiled and merely said she liked fresh fish.</p>\n<p>Temperance brought up Mr. Bacon. "He's a great connoisseur of Italian food, I can tell you that much. Not a member of my flock."</p>\n<p>"I hear he...dabbles in the occult."</p>\n<p>"The Church is modernizing, we don't have to attribute all these...tools of ignorance to Satan. You know, I was just talking to Alphonse down at the grocery and he mentioned he hadn't seen Mr. Bacon for a while. He called in a large delivery order but hasn't come in since, and normally he buys fresh vegetables for his dinner every night. Very European."</p>\n<p>There was one other odd thing, it turned out that Father Vic had heard, second hand from a widow who lived on Bacon's street. Last night some cars had pulled up to Bacon's house and taken out a young man of color from it. There was a curly-haired man with a mustache who had seemed to be in charge.</p>\n<p>"My informant likes to think she's on\xa0<em>Dragnet</em>. You're not in pictures, are you? Because I have this interesting idea for a TV show about a handsome young priest..."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Lisa found Jimmy in his room. He was feeling much better after a couple of days of bed rest but trying to stay grumpy to keep people from bothering him. She sat down on a chair across from the bed. "Mr. Wright? I suppose we should...talk about that kiss. Are you sorry I kissed you? You didn't seem to want..."</p>\n<p>"I was bleeding after all."</p>\n<p>"I was caught up in the moment. Like some silly TV character."</p>\n<p>"It's okay. There's nothing wrong with that."</p>\n<p>"I didn't say there was anything wrong with kissing you!"</p>\n<p>"I'm not good with people anymore," said Jimmy as gruffly as he could.</p>\n<p>"You could be, I think, if you wanted to. It seems to me that you're fighting who you are, that you're really a good person who protects the people in his life."</p>\n<p>"I have failed...so many people that I tried to protect."</p>\n<p>"Did you succeed with any of them?"</p>\n<p>Jimmy fingered the engagement ring in his pocket. "I did. But I can't see her anymore. I hurt the people I am close to."</p>\n<p>"I let Percy go off and do this madness. I should have protected him. I knew what kind of person he was. I don't know. I guess I keep looking for older men to protect me."</p>\n<p>"You know what I believe? That you can protect yourself."</p>\n<p>"Elizabeth Schicksal can protect herself, eh? I mean, I knew how to shoot a little when I was growing up. But I don't know anything about all this! I'm not some kind of brassy film noir dame! I'm just a farmgirl with a PhD."</p>\n<p>"I knew a farmgirl. She was...extremely brave. Loved comic books. She never let anything get her down."</p>\n<p>"She sounds remarkable."</p>\n<p>"And she didn't even have a PhD."</p>\n<p>"What was her name?"</p>\n<p>He paused. "Betty."</p>\n<p>"Like the dog?" She grinned. "I don't let anyone call me Betty. Percy called me Elise...you know, French. He thought it sounded more European or something."</p>\n<p>"You can be anything you put your mind to. Most people who went through what we went through last night wouldn't have handled it so well."</p>\n<p>"It\xa0<em>was</em>\xa0pretty thrilling. I mean, up until when you brutally murdered that man. But he was a bad man, right? He killed your friend?"</p>\n<p>"And many other people, and he would probably have killed many more."</p>\n<p>"Then I think he got what he deserved. I mean, if you can do that--if you can be a force of justice...then I want to help you. I guess what I want to know is...if I do that, will you help teach me to be more than I am now?"</p>\n<p>Jimmy's face contorted with warring emotions. "I will show you how to protect yourself. What you do with that is up to you. And when I'm done, you need to stay far, far away from me. For your own good."</p>\n<p>She sat back and pushed her glasses up her nose a little defiantly.

And if what Percy did threatens not just you and me but...everybody? And we don't even know what he was doing! I saw the movie! That King was really scary! Why is everyone wearing masks all of a sudden! What does that mean? Do I have to drop my mask? Do you?"</p>\n<p>"I don't think that was the metaphor they were going for..."</p>\n<p>"I mean, what are we underneath? Who are you, under your mask, Temperance?"</p>\n<p>"I don't wear a mask!"</p>\n<p>"I saw that girl kiss you."</p>\n<p>"And I didn't like it!"</p>\n<p>"That's deeply disturbing," said Charleston, walking into the room and flopping down in an armchair. "She gave you a sign of affection and you hated it?"</p>\n<p>"I didn't like it. It made me uncomfortable. It was unsolicited. And I'm a good Catholic girl," said Temperance coldly.</p>\n<p>"We all pretend a little bit to be people we're not," said Lisa. "You went out to find information today, Temperance. Can you say you didn't lie to anyone?"</p>\n<p>"I didn't tell everyone the truth, but that doesn't mean I bore false witness."</p>\n<p>"No, it means you were concealing something. Like you were wearing a mask."</p>\n<p>"You're reaching for a metaphor."</p>\n<p>"Maybe I am. I'm not an artist like Candace. You don't understand because you haven't been married yet. Everything changes. Now you're some man's husband, not who you used to be. You can't have your own money--it's all your husband's. You think it's an accident you put on a veil when you get married? I'm not some crazy women's libber type, but the symbolism is important! You lose your name! Another name drops down on top of it. I wasn't always Elizabeth Schicksal."</p>\n<p>"There is an issue of identity, yes," said Temperance soothingly. "I don't mean to downplay that."</p>\n<p>"I could have kept my maiden name professionally, but I didn't feel like it," mused Lisa. "I liked Percy. I thought he was a good man. He just got crazier as he got older. I mean, you know, that's how men are." She sat down in a glower and lit a cigarette. "All I know is that movie\xa0<em>shook</em>\xa0me. I feel...<em>unmoored</em>."</p>\n<p>"I may not be an artist," said Temperance, "but I understand the artistic world. Your husband had an obsession. He's chasing the horizon."</p>\n<p>"He's not my husband any more. I only use the name because, fuck it--" Temperance raised her eyebrow: she'd never heard Lisa swear before.</p>\n<p>"Almost every artist I know is the same way," said Temperance. "They can paint the most perfect painting, type the most perfect words, but it will never be good enough. That was a masterpiece we saw at Asylum!"</p>\n<p>They could hear the sound of furious typing coming from Candace's room.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460867/#Comment_460867" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-03T15:42:10+00:00" title="March  3, 2017  3:42PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2017 3:42PM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: You Want It Darker (Part 15)</b>\n<p>"That was Amadou," said Lisa.

They're wounded," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"So was it worth it? Should we stop?"</p>\n<p>"They say it was worth what they went through, yes."</p>\n<p>"If we keep going, we're not going to stay the same. Everything is going to get stripped away from us.

He was wearing a smoking jacket and slippers, and was high on Yellow, of course.</p>\n<p>"Can you smell those?" said Lisa sarcastically. "I mean, you watched the movie and you're blind. And then there was the levitation."</p>\n<p>"Parlor tricks."</p>\n<p>"I've seen that, true, in a magic show. Not in real life."</p>\n<p>"I tell you how it works, and you're angry?" said Charleston. "What do you want out of life, to start fights for no reason?"</p>\n<p>"Temperance is pretty feisty."</p>\n<p>"I'm\xa0<em>feisty</em>?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Ladies, if you have something you don't like, and somebody offers you a way out, you take it! Honesty isn't worth all that much!\xa0Trust me. Trust me."</p>\n<p>"Well what about you, Mr. Chiu? What's lurking behind your mask?"</p>\n<p>"My mask? I'm an open book! What would you like to know?"</p>\n<p>"Have you seen stuff--sorry, poor choice of words--have things like this happened to you before?"</p>\n<p>Charleston chuckled bitterly. "From time to time. I've done stuff like this to others."</p>\n<p>"What were you like before it all happened?"</p>\n<p>"I would say a lifetime of experiences have really opened my eyes. It seems a little odd at first, I'd imagine, when you initially encounter the fact that people can do things you never thought possible. But really, when it comes down to it, who you are and what you want never really changes. Just because you get the access and the ability to do things other people can't doesn't mean that you're going to turn into a better a person\xa0<em>or</em>\xa0a worse person. What it means is that the ability to embrace a power that nobody else can stop is in you, that's when you find out who you truly are. When no one can stop you, when no one can tell you what to do, when you can embrace all your true desires, what you see come out at that time is really who you are at your core."</p>\n<p>"That sounds like godlike power," said Lisa defiantly. "Humans can't have power like that."</p>\n<p>"It's not necessarily godlike power, but it sure is a godlike feeling. The best part of finding out who you are is that if you find out you don't like it, from that point onwards you can try to change it."</p>\n<p>"That's easy for you to say, you don't have to change your name back."</p>\n<p>"Why not change your name back if you want," said Temperance. "Come up with a new last name."</p>\n<p>"My old last name was kind of stupid anyway," said Lisa.</p>\n<p>"This is all about a\xa0<em>label</em>?" said Charleston. "Hyphenate!"</p>\n<p>"That seems too European. It was a city, my old last name. I should pick a different city, maybe. What's a good city name?"</p>\n<p>"It's not a city, but how about\xa0<em>Queens</em>?"</p>\n<p>"That would be appropriate. Lisa Queens?"</p>\n<p>"How about Elizabeth Queen?"</p>\n<p>"It's got a ring to it," said Temperance with a smile.</p>\n<p>"Yeah...but maybe not Elizabeth. Simpler. Beth."\xa0</p>\n<p>"Gives a name to your aspirations," said Charleston. "Let's people know who you are, who you want to be."</p>\n<p>"I do kinda like that," said Beth. "Sounds better than Auckland at least. That was a hard name to use."</p>\n<p><em>[And Jimmy wasn't there to hear this big reveal!

He whipped up a couple of drinks and held his glass aloft in salutation: "A toast...to Miss Queen."</p>\n<p>"Wait!" said Beth. "That's\xa0<em>Doctor</em>\xa0Queen." She took a drink. "What the hell is that stuff?" she spluttered.</p>\n<p>"Your reaction was an exaggeration, right?" said Temperance. She took a drink. Her eyes got very far away. "I have to go to the bathroom now."</p>\n<p>"I can't decide which is worse," mused Beth. "Being like Charleston, or being like Jimmy.

Like how Andy, her husband, had done before going away to war. And she felt...a movement in the air, a prickling of the skin on the back of her neck, as if someone was almost,\xa0<em>almost</em>\xa0touching her...</p>\n<p>It was gone. She sighed, pulled the cover over her typewriter, and rolled into her hard hotel bed. She was asleep almost instantly.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"You know how to shoot, right?" Beth asked Temperance over breakfast the next morning.</p>\n<p>"Yes, a little."</p>\n<p>"I was wondering if you would like to go to the gun range with me. I grew up on a farm, I know how to shoot."</p>\n<p>"Is this because of all the\xa0<em>excitement</em>\xa0lately?"</p>\n<p>"Well, I saw Mr. Wright do something...and if that kind of thing keeps happening, I want to make sure I'm prepared."</p>\n<p>They found a place in Alameda County that didn't mind some ladies up from San Francisco doing some target shooting. They shot off an entire clip each from the .32 automatic pistols Colonel Murphy had helpfully put in their camper's gun rack. Nothing too good for his little girl, after all.</p>\n<p>The targets scooted back to them on their wires. Temperance's hits were mostly aimed to be non-lethal if possible: tight groupings in the shoulders and a couple of hits center mass. Beth's...well, Beth...</p>\n<p>"I guess I'm still a little rusty," she said, and bit her lip. She'd missed the target entirely with every round. "Maybe shooting isn't my thing anymore."</p>\n<p>Temperance tried to do what she could with some tips, but it soon became apparent that Beth couldn't hit the broad side of a barn even if she was standing inside it.</p>\n<p>"Are you perhaps a lefty?" asked Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Maybe I'm more near-sighted now than I remember. I guess this isn't my...m\xe9tier."</p>\n<p>"There's something that my mother learned that you might find very useful, and you can probably find a teacher around here: the ancient art of\xa0<em>karate</em>..."</p>\n<p>A day later Beth sat down in Temperance's room, her arm in a sling. "Nope," she said.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy reviewed their options while shaving. Lawrence Bacon was holed up in his house. Amadou Lalin had been shipped off by the Neurotologists to an unknown location. He'd been staking out Bacon's house for a while and he was sure nobody had come in or out for several days.\xa0</p>\n<p>And each of them had seen something different when they watched the film of\xa0<em>The Unanswered Question</em>.</p>\n<p>"Maybe we should go down and check out the Neurotologists," suggested Temperance over breakfast.</p>\n<p>"Maybe their records," murmured Jimmy. "I was able to pull the building plans for Bacon's house. He doesn't have any bunker or anything there. Tuck said he comes out to feed on derelicts ever two to six weeks, so sooner or later that will probably happen."</p>\n<p><em>[Bureaucracy spend by JP.]</em></p>\n<p>"Jimmy, don't even think about it," said Temperance. "I know it would be easy for you to look like a homeless person."</p>\n<p>Jimmy sighed. "Then maybe the office."</p>\n<p>"One target: their files. We don't stay long."</p>\n<p>"We do it quick and quietly, agreed."</p>\n<p>"This is really alarming coming from you, Temperance," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"It's the least violent thing we can do, and there isn't anything in the Bible about breaking into a house to\xa0<em>not</em>\xa0steal anything. And don't you two start casting stones at me!"</p>\n<p>"I'm not the one who presents herself as holier-than-thou."</p>\n<p>"I never! Oh, I'm sorry when someone hit on me at a crazy party. And I'm not comfortable when a woman did it to me. I didn't make it my problem that you went off with that lady!"</p>\n<p><em>Why,</em>\xa0thought Jimmy,\xa0<em>have I spent most of my life surrounded by crazy women?</em>\xa0"What the hell happened to Beth, by the way?" he said out loud.</p>\n<p>"Don't give her a gun, first," said Temperance. "Have you ever heard of\xa0<em>karate</em>? She wasn't very good at it."</p>\n<p>"Your mom wasn't any good at it!"</p>\n<p>"Did my mother ever dislocate her own arm?"</p>\n<p>Jimmy frowned. "I can't remember. She lost two of them, however."</p>\n<p>"I am willing to go on this excursion.

Jimmy cased it for a while during the day, then brought the others over to it late that night. He noted that Temperance was dressed sensibly in black with gloves and Candace was wearing an expensive black sweater. He shook his head and led them down the back alley to the rear door of the office.</p>\n<p>He must be rusty; it took him a long time to pick the lock. Maybe it was the arthritis. But after ten sweaty minutes he felt the lock click and he swung through the door into a utility room. Peter's office wasn't far beyond it.</p>\n<p>He rested in the corner while Temperance got to work on the file cabinets. She rifled through the files, noting they had files on herself and Jimmy under their aliases. The file on Amadou Lalin had been emptied out. The files on local Neurotologists were thick and detailed; they had the transcripts of their "Debriefing" sessions. She figured there was a small fortune in blackmail there. She grabbed a bunch of random files, Peter Morrison's own file, and her own file.</p>\n<p>They heard somebody come down the stairs. They all hid in the corners as Peter Morrison walked by and went into the kitchen. Peter opened the fridge, took out a beer, and pulled off the tab. He closed the door, revealing Jimmy Wright standing behind him.</p>\n<p>Jimmy cold-cocked him with a sock full of ball bearings. Peter staggered back. "You!" he said. He pulled out a whistle from under his shirt and began to blow on it. Jimmy didn't hear any sound, so he smashed him again with the sap.</p>\n<p>Peter fell into the corner, bleeding, the fight all out of him. Jimmy noticed however that he had a rather smarmy grin on his face.</p>\n<p>"If I were you," said Peter, "I'd\xa0<em>run</em>."</p>\n<p>Jimmy turned around and ran back to the rear door, followed by Temperance and Candace. They sped out into the alley. Fog rolled down it from the street. A shadow suddenly seemed to fall across the exit.</p>\n<p>And then there were two men in bad black suits standing there. One held out a badge. "We're with Security," he said. They had the same waxen features of the other black-suited agents they had seen before.</p>\n<p>Temperance faded into the side of the alley as the two agents walked down the alley. "Mr. Wright, we want to have a word with you," one said.</p>\n<p>"No thanks."</p>\n<p>"Hit him, Mr. Stapler." The other agent smacked him with his open hand. Jimmy winced with the pain\u2014he'd been\xa0<em>cut</em>, like with claws.</p>\n<p>Candace smashed her crowbar into the agent's knee, as hard as she could. There was a crunching noise, and for a moment she thought she'd crippled him. Then the agent\xa0<em>hissed</em>\xa0at her; he'd felt the blow, but it hadn't slowed him much.</p>\n<p>Temperance shot out from the shadows and smashed her heavy sack of equipment into the same leg. Something splattered out of the wound. It wasn't blood. The agent collapsed to the ground and began to\xa0<em>dissolve.</em></p>\n<p>She ran. Jimmy was right behind her, and Candace just a little way ahead. The other agent slashed at her as she came by, rending her sweater, tearing into the flesh of her side. She could feel blood pouring out of the wounds and she staggered, but Jimmy threw his shoulder under hers and dragged her to their car.</p>\n<p>When they got back to the hotel, Beth threw up her hands. "What the hell is wrong with you people! Mr. Wright! Look how inflamed that wound is!"</p>\n<p>"I feel terrible," said Temperance. Beth sighed and began to clean the wounds. Jimmy handed her a broad-spectrum antibiotic from their medical kit, and then helped her put in a few stitches.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy sorted through the files they'd stolen while Temperance tossed in uneasy dreams. There was one thing he thought they might be able to use: two tickets to a fundraiser in Los Angeles for Neurotology. The accompanying flier said that N. Quincy Lund himself would be in attendance. He kept flipping through the papers.</p>\n<p>"Charleston," he said, "I've got Bacon's number in here."</p>\n<p>"What would I say?" asked Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Just be yourself."</p>\n<p>Charleston shrugged and dialed the phone. After a few rings, someone answered. "Yes," he said, panting. "Who is this?"</p>\n<p>"I\u2019m looking for a Mah Jong partner. I hear Mr. Bacon can accommodate."</p>\n<p>"Mr. Chiu." Bacon's voice had changed; it was hoarser and he panted out each word as if he was having trouble breathing.</p>\n<p>"The one and only. Well, as far as I know."</p>\n<p>"Interesting. That you. Should call. Perhaps I am. Ready. To have that Interview. Come to. The House. Whenever. You wish."</p>\n<p>"Can I bring the whole gang? It sounds like quite a party.</p>\n<p>"It won't. Matter." Bacon hung up.</p>\n<p>"I've got good news, and really good news," said Charleston to the others. "The good news is, I think I made a friend. The better news is that he invited everyone to come to his place."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461115/#Comment_461115" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-14T17:15:53+00:00" title="March 14, 2017  5:15PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...So, if Millicent were to hang around Charleston for a long time, she'd make a Charlestonspeak glossary.<br/><br/>...oh, wait, she may have dealt with him in the Other Place.

They drove from their hotel down to Pacific Heights. All around them families, dressed in their best, were traveling to their families or dropping in on friends' houses.</p>\n<p><em>[There was a brief visit to the hospital by Jimmy\u2014after all, he's a veteran\u2014to get healed up.</em></p>\n<p><em>That it's now Thanksgiving makes a complete hash of the timeline!

Everyone window had the blinds pulled down, and there was a subtle feeling around it, as if it had already been abandoned. Charleston went to knock on the door but it creaked open as soon as he touched it.</p>\n<p>Charleston took a swig from the flask he had of rum mixed with Yellow. His third eye opened up and he stepped over the threshold into the house. The rest followed him. The house was dark and gloomy. They could see someone sitting in an armchair in the deepest shadows of the room.</p>\n<p>To Charleston's mystic sight, he was glowing like the sun. "Mr. Bacon, I presume," he said.</p>\n<p>"I'm not sure. I still can claim. That name. I'm not sure. That I have a name. I made an Oath long ago. For knowledge. And that promise. Has come due." He stood up and stepped into the dim light from the open door. His skin was scaly and hardening, and his body was becoming somehow amorphous or amphibian-like.</p>\n<p>"For," said Bacon. "<em>He is coming</em>."</p>\n<p>"You sound so fatalistic. It seems to me you are moving on to wonderful things."</p>\n<p>"I understand now why so many sorcerers wanted to kill you."</p>\n<p>Charleston uncomfortably denied knowing what he was talking about. Bacon retreated to his chair and gestured around the room. Jimmy, Candace and Temperance began to look around as their shock dissipated. There was a copy of the\xa0<em>Turner Codex</em>\xa0that Jimmy uncovered. Candace found a copy of\xa0<em>L'homme errant au bord du lac</em>. It was the same text as Temperance's copy of that book, but this one had extensive notes in Bacon's handwriting. Temperance found his daily planner which meticulously detailed his activities; she noticed he had called a number in Los Angeles several times over the last few days. Jimmy found a piece of paper:</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PROJECT TAROT PRINCIPALS (1951-1953)</p>\nPercy [Percival Schicksal]<br/>Carl [Simon]<br/>Juliet [M- ?]<br/>Barbara [?]<br/>Solomon Molinari<br/>N.

Mr. Lund intends to repeat Mr. Schicksal's experiment."</p>\n<p>"That worked really well for him. He seemed pleased with the results..."</p>\n<p>"Lalin is the key. He will summon the city. It will be easier to bring the Presence into the world that way."</p>\n<p>"That sounds fabulous. Could we see him?"</p>\n<p>Bacon explained that Amadou had been taken by Lund, along with Dr. Montague. "One day she will be more like me," he rasped.</p>\n<p>"Perhaps we all will be."</p>\n<p>"I very much hope not. For all your sakes. I think perhaps now would be a good time for you all to leave. While I can. Contain. Myself."</p>\n<p>Temperance noticed that the arms of the chair Bacon was sitting in had been crushed almost to powder under his grasp. She nodded at the rest and they backed quickly down the hall.</p>\n<p>"You can't escape him Mr. Chiu! He will come for you!" shouted Bacon as they darted down the porch.</p>\n<p>"Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Bacon!" shouted Charleston as nonchalantly as possible.</p>\n<p>Before they got in the car, he finished his flask of Yellow and then smashed it. He slit his hand with the shards and then wrote some symbols in blood next to the door to Bacon's house. If it worked, it would keep any innocents from entering the house, by shifting them to a slightly out of phase time.</p>\n<p><em>[That was CP's Yellow-mandated Art spend. And was quite interesting, considering my own ideas about the Yellow Mythos...]</em></p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Back at the hotel they reviewed the books. Candace found Bacon's criticism quite insightful\u2014she had that moment so uncomfortable for an author when they realize the critic seems to have understood the work better than the creator. Everything led to an unusual conclusion: that Lalin's work was the key to a powerful summoning, and that there were elements of that summoning that Lalin was not aware of himself.</p>\n<p>Jimmy and Candace ran down the numbers in Bacon's diary. Most were to the Neurotology Headquarters in Los Angeles (just outside Santa Monica), but a couple of exchanges were for somewhere out in the San Fernando Valley.</p>\n<p>Candace went down to one of the few bars open on Thanksgiving where Kerouac and Neal Cassady were drinking. "The fair Candace," said Neal. Behind him Kerouac shouted something and slipped off his stool. "I'm always willing to hear what you are laying down."</p>\n<p>"My friends and I are thinking that the scene here in San Francisco is over, and want to go check out LA. So how's a road trip sound to you?"</p>\n<p>Neal wanted to know what conveyance, chariot, vehicle they had brought, and Candace told him about the RV. Neal then wanted to know just how much he could push the RV on the trip.</p>\n<p>"Whatever it takes," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"'Whatever it takes' are my two favorite words in the English language."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461127/#Comment_461127" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-15T17:45:40+00:00" title="March 15, 2017  5:45PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, you actually make me feel a little sorry for Bacon-the-serial-murderer.

Temperance hid in her bedroom. Jimmy took a nap.</p>\n<p><em>[It cost a point of Stability to sit up front with Neal; he was a demon on the road.]</em></p>\n<p>Temperance, as their dedicated square was the natural choice to go to the Neurotology party. And to accompany her, Jimmy had rented a tuxedo and was slowly trying to put himself back into presentable shape. It used to be easier.</p>\n<p><em>[JP used a point of XP to buy a point of High Society in order to fit in at the party; you can imagine the montage of Jimmy gradually turning from derelict into something presentable. Quoth JP, "That's what XP are for\u2014to fill in those gaps." I should mention it also nicely makes sense\u2014Jimmy had once been a big shot in LA, so it's natural that he would be able to grudgingly return to his old form.]</em></p>\n<p>Candace called Vladimir from their hotel\u2014once they had found one that would look the other way at hosting a jazz band\u2014to see if he had received the first draft of her novel she'd sent him. Nabokov wasn't sure he could follow it; he wondered if Candace had been under the influence of anything while writing it.</p>\n<p>"Only the influence of Art," she said.</p>\n<p>"I have to think about it all. The writing is fine, I'm not sure I follow the actual story. I do note something quite interesting: you are aware that you are writing the novel in blank verse. If I put the line breaks in, it flows quite naturally. Almost as if you were writing a Shakespearean play. I can only assume this was your intention."</p>\n<p>"Yes\u2014I mean...I met some poets out here..."</p>\n<p>"Well, I suppose if it was good enough for\xa0<em>Melville</em>, then that's all right...I guess..."</p>\n<p>She hung up the phone. "Jack, Neal, want to hit some bars?"</p>\n<p>It turns out that the two of them knew all the best dive bars in Los Angeles, and took her to all of them. And Neal, it developed, was quite a tender lover.\xa0</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The party was at a tony Beverly Hills hotel. There was a sedate mambo band in one corner, and the usual glittering array of society dames surrounded by their escorts in black tie. Temperance saw a man holding court in one corner of the room. He was in his late forties but had a robust charm that made him look younger; his hair was curly and he sported a thin mustache. She knew him from his pictures, especially the one on the dust jacket of\xa0<em>Diametrics</em>: Nathan Quincy Lund, the founder of Neurotology.</p>\n<p>Jimmy saw Temperance skating over to talk to Lund. He wanted to keep a close eye on her in case anyone made them. Which is why he didn't see the woman who bumped into him from behind. "Oh my goodness, I'm sorry\u2014<em>Jimmy</em>?"</p>\n<p>It was Janet Winston Rogers. Of course. "What on earth are you doing? What are you wearing? I suppose a tux is magic\u2014when you wear one, I see you," she said. But she smiled.</p>\n<p>"I heard about this event," he started.</p>\n<p>"What's that you have around your neck?" she said. Jimmy tucked the engagement ring he had given her once and now wore as a necklace back under his shirt. "What's wrong with you? You look pale, like you've seen a ghost. Am I that frightening to you?"</p>\n<p>"Absolutely not. You just...caught me off guard."</p>\n<p>"Jimmy, what happened to you?" She put a hand on his arm.</p>\n<p>"War, death, homelessness."</p>\n<p>"You didn't have to be homeless, you know."</p>\n<p>"I think I did."</p>\n<p>"Have a drink with me, at least."</p>\n<p>"Why not two?"</p>\n<p>She smiled again. "I think you're going to need more than just a double."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"There I was," said Lund. "Standing in the middle of a desert. And that's how I found the way to write this book. The old Tibetan guru had given me the idea, and I made it come to life." Temperance slid up next to him.</p>\n<p>"Hello my dear," he said to her. "I don't think I've ever seen you at one of these before."</p>\n<p>"I only show up on random occasions."</p>\n<p>"You look a little familiar, can't place you..."</p>\n<p>"My last name is Murphy."</p>\n<p>"Not the same as that ridiculous man with the campers...you are? I bought one of those from him. It was actually useful for me, I bought some land up in the Valley a few years ago and while we were building the development it was useful for me to go out and keep an eye on the workers. Was able to get a good price on the land. Strange area."</p>\n<p>"I've only been up there once or twice."</p>\n<p>"You remember that blackout back in '26? I suppose you weren't born yet. Old-timers like me...anyway, the place I bought was where the transformer that blew and started the blackout was located. And some crazy religious cult burned down a building there."</p>\n<p>"A religious cult? Imagine!"</p>\n<p>"All sorts of weird things in California. N. Quincy Lund," he said shaking her hand. "This is my shindig."</p>\n<p>Temperance studied him. He had the air of...the cat who had eaten the canary. She could tell that he was a smug bastard most of the time, but something made it even more pronounced right now.</p>\n<p><em>[Mostly High Society and BS Detector to ping this; I think I wrote the clue to actually work for Psychology, but it was harmless enough to give out for the other skill.]</em></p>\n<p>"You should come out and take a look at it," he said. "While there's still space available. I'm putting up a housing development. Everything new and wonderful. Incorporating the place as a town, calling it Chambersburg." He lit a pipe, and then looked up. "Clark! Wonderful to see you!"</p>\n<p>While Lund talked to Clark Gable, Temperance quietly slipped off into the crowd.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"Jimmy, you keep running into me after coming out of the cold for the first time in fifteen years," said Janet, as they started their second round of drinks.</p>\n<p>"I'm doing a favor for Bradley. Sort of strongarmed me out of the cold, I guess you could say."</p>\n<p>"You really shouldn't be a stranger, Jimmy. I know things have been hard between us. If I had known where to find you...I would have apologized."</p>\n<p>"You...you don't need to\u2014"</p>\n<p>"I was very rude to you."</p>\n<p>"I am pretty sure I could have handled the situation better," Jimmy started.</p>\n<p>"You mean how you broke my heart? Yes, I suppose that could have been\xa0<em>better handled</em>." She finished her drink and waved to the bartender. "There hasn't been anyone serious since you."</p>\n<p>"There's...not been anyone at all. Wandering around the desert..."</p>\n<p>"Jimmy, you always were a sentimental old fool. Now I suppose we're just old fools together."</p>\n<p>"Cheers."\xa0</p>\n<p>The next morning they slept in together, the Los Angeles sunlight streaming through the curtains of her Hollywood bungalow, illuminating her hand running over his chest, fingering the ring he wore around his neck.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461157/#Comment_461157" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-17T15:43:43+00:00" title="March 17, 2017  3:43PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Came So Far For Beauty (Part 5)</b>\n<p>Janet dropped him off back at the hotel. Betty the dog came padding out to him, saw Janet, and howled. Beth followed her out of the room. "Was that an old friend of yours?" she said, trying to keep the hurt out of her voice.</p>\n<p>"Where did you go last night?" demanded Temperance from inside.</p>\n<p>At that moment Candace came gliding down the hallway in a dishevelled cocktail dress. "Morning everyone," she said.</p>\n<p>Charleston didn't yell at him; he and Helen had slept in the RV that night. Charleston had been sweeping the emergency channel on the CB listening for reports of people being murdered by having their skin cut off.</p>\n<p>"Well, I found out some information, at least," huffed Temperance. "Mr. Lund has some property in the San Fernando Valley. A town called Chambersburg."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>As soon as everyone was more or less presentable they tumbled into the RV and drove up to the Valley, following the 101 through Hollywood and into the rapidly-surburbanizing neighborhoods where once oranges had blossomed. It took a few hours, but they finally happened upon Chambersburg, a pleasant, smallish housing development arranged in a broad semicircle around an artificial lake. Straight roads ran radially from the center of town, connecting curving cul-de-sacs lined with identical California split-level houses. A broad village green jutted like a tongue through the town; a Christmas tree had been erected in the center of it. At the end of the green, on the shore of the lake, was a half-ruined building with an amphitheater looking over the water. One wing of the building had been abandoned, the other currently housed the town hall and the high school.</p>\n<p>Jimmy reached into his pocket and tightly gripped the engagement ring. He recognized the building, the "New Temple of Joy" that had been the site of certain unpleasant events in his life back in 1937. Temperance stared at him. "You only do this when you see something that could harm us," she began.</p>\n<p>"Nothing. Old history."</p>\n<p>"Old history that could come back to bite us on the...ass?"</p>\n<p>"I don't know the future. I don't know. I only know the past."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The people of the town looked like they could have filled out a casting call for a sitcom set in Anytown, USA. Children played on the sidewalks, watched over by their mothers, who had their hair tied up neatly under scarves. They passed a soda shop named Doc's, and a bar. They grabbed some lunch at Flo's diner and tried to get the lay of the land.</p>\n<p>Flo wanted to know if they were in town for the Shriner's convention being held "up the road a piece." Candace allowed that they might be interested in buying some property in the area. "We got lots of lots to sell," said Flo. "But I should warn you, we have some\xa0<em>pretty stringent requirements</em>."</p>\n<p>She told them that there was a hotel just outside town, the El Rey, although with the convention they might not have any rooms. Temperance half-listened to the conversation. She'd noticed something odd: she hadn't seen a church, even a storefront Pentecostal place, anywhere in town. Which seemed out of character for the kind of town they were claiming to be.</p>\n<p><em>[Anthropology use by TP.]</em></p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Neal Cassady drove Candace up to the motel, a rather typical example of its type: long rows of identical windows and doors, a semicircular drive and a porte cochere in front of the rental office. "I only have two rooms," the desk clerk said. Candace paid anyway, and took the keys from the clerk. He handed her a couple of matchbooks. She saw the full name of the motel written on them: El Rey de los Jirones. It took her a while to find someone who could translate that for her: the King of Tatters.</p>\n<p>Jimmy went down to Sam's Bar off the green. It was a pleasant Californy-type place: clean leatherette booths, high stools with green leather seats, a smooth wooden bar with brass finishings. Behind it was a man wearing a white jacket and a bow tie. "My name's Sam," he said. "What can I get you?"</p>\n<p>"James."</p>\n<p>"You a Shriner, James?"</p>\n<p>"Yes."</p>\n<p>"Good, we have a discount for Shriners; half-price beers." Jimmy bought one and got a dish of water for Betty. He sat down at the bar next to a rather nervous-looking little man. He was bald, with thick round spectacles. "So you're a\xa0<em>Shriner\xa0</em>too," he said. "Henry Lister. I'm with the San Francisco chapter. Pleased to meet you. I bet you're very excited about the convention."</p>\n<p>"I may not look it, but I am excited." Jimmy could see a copy of\xa0<em>Diametrics</em>\xa0tucked into his jacket pocket. "You read\xa0<em>Diametrics</em>?"</p>\n<p>"Of course. We're both\xa0<em>Shriners</em>."</p>\n<p>"I was at the charity event."</p>\n<p>"You saw Mr. Lund? How lucky! I think he's going to try and do a repeat of the '53 Summoning."</p>\n<p>"Too bad what happened the first time."</p>\n<p>"There was interference. If it hadn't been for that busybody...I don't know what you know, so I don't want to get too far into it. What a charming dog. Do they allow dogs on the other side?"</p>\n<p>"We're certainly going to find out. An exciting experiment."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance went down to Debbie's Dos, a hair salon on the other side of the green from Sam's Bar. (Flo had intimated that Debbie and Sam had a\xa0<em>thing</em>.) Debbie was a middle-aged brassy blonde with a pencil stuck behind one ear. "What are you here for, darlin'? Permanent, manicure? Maybe do something about those brows I think..."</p>\n<p>"My brows...oh, no. I have an important event tonight\u2014"</p>\n<p>"You're going caroling?"</p>\n<p>"Yes. I was invited to go and want to look my best."</p>\n<p>"It's supposed to be quite an event. Don't know what to expect, but it should be very\xa0<em>entertaining</em>. Sure been practicing those new songs a lot."</p>\n<p>"I don't know too much. I was invited by an old school friend."</p>\n<p>Temperance sat down for a set and a permanent. While she was under the hairdryer, she noticed another woman glancing over from time to time. She was a youngish woman, with blonde hair done up in curlers. She introduced herself as Joy, Mrs. Joy Harris that is. "You're not from around here, are you? Are you here for the caroling? An old friend? Are you Midwest Chapter?"</p>\n<p>"Signed up in Los Angeles."</p>\n<p>"They sure sent you up here quickly."</p>\n<p>Temperance spun up a tale about going through a rapid induction process. "Don't worry," said Joy. "We're all Neurotologists here. I'm...a little worried about the ceremony. I'm frightened for my kids. I don't know what's going on, and you're not from around here, so maybe you can look out for them? Little Jack Junior, and Jenny, and Ray is only 8 months old..."\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance cooed (she hoped) over the pictures Joy showed her. "You can put them in our vehicle."</p>\n<p>"There seemed to be some disreputable people there...I think I saw...a..."</p>\n<p>Temperance grimaced. "Mencius is very nice and helps out with the...cleaning."</p>\n<p><em>[Me: Oh God, people were so racist...then.

Charleston held up a roll of quarters. "Help a guy out who can't see. Why don't you play some of the new stuff you kids like."</p>\n<p>"You would like...Little Richard?" smirked one of the clean-cut youth of America.</p>\n<p>"You met him? He's a\xa0<em>crazy</em>\xa0cat."</p>\n<p>"I do like him, don't understand why he sings like a girl."</p>\n<p>"Doesn't come through right on the record. But you get a chance, go see him, no matter what it takes."</p>\n<p>"You're clearly pulling my leg, but I'll put him on anyway." He snatched the roll of quarters, dropped one into the jukebox, and chose a three-song set: "Tutti Frutti", "Maybellene", and of course "Rock Around the Clock."</p>\n<p>"Should we dance or something?" said Helen. Charleston shrugged and they swayed together for a while. "What else do you like here?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"We like Pat Boone," said one fresh-scrubbed young platinum blonde girl. "Or Perry Como. And Frank Sinatra is pretty good, even if he is a little old."</p>\n<p>"I met him once," muttered Charleston as the girls punched up some Pat Boone. "This is better than what we have to sing tonight," said Platinum to Charleston. "I don't know why we can't just sing regular carols like everyone else."</p>\n<p>"Making music is a wonderful thing," said Charleston. "What even is this?"</p>\n<p>"Something out on the green. We're singing some kind of new songs."</p>\n<p>"They're like all in\xa0<em>French</em>," said another girl.</p>\n<p>"French! What's happening to our country!"\xa0</p>\n<p>"It's all for our parents. They're so impressed Mr. Lund is coming tonight. I think they're all crazy. They're all in that church, that Neurotology thing."</p>\n<p>Helen elbowed Charleston. "Doc is looking at us," she hissed.</p>\n<p>The girls had noticed Doc's interest. "I think we have some homework," they said and began picking their books up.</p>\n<p>"Maybe I'll see you tonight," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I doubt it," said some smart-aleck, and the kids laughed as they left.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>As evening began to fall, the population of the town gathered on the green. The Christmas tree blazed with yellow lights. It was a cold and clear evening; as the sun sank, the first stars came out. High above the apex of the tree Jimmy could see Aldebaran blazing an intense, angry red. It was brighter than he'd ever seen it before.</p>\n<p>Temperance stood next to Joy; she'd already secured her children inside the RV, where Beth, Van, and the band were keeping watch and trying to entertain them. The crowd started to softly sing Christmas carols\u2014some so old that Temperance didn't recognize them; a few were in other languages, mostly French and German. In between they chanted slow ritual phrases. With a start she realized that the chants were the "songs" from\xa0<em>L'homme errant au bord du lac</em>, Amadou Lalin's strange book of dreams and poems.</p>\n<p>As the sun set, a fleet of limousines drove through town. To Jimmy's expert eye, they were clearly armored, with heavy bulletproof glass in the windows. Candace got a fleeting glimpse of Amadou Lalin huddled in the back of one of them, wrapped in a blanket and a muffler. The temperature was dropping fast now that the sun was below the horizon; it was colder than any of them, even Temperance, had ever known California to get in December.</p>\n<p>The cars drove to the other end of Lake Till, as the huge ornamental pool was called, and stopped. A sound system turned on with a whine of feedback. Amadou's thin, weak voice began to be broadcast, singing a strange song that was not from his book but very much in its style. As he sang, his voice got stronger, deeper, richer, and the words struck their listeners to the core. If Rilke had written music, it would sound like this; if Wallace Stevens had written lyrics, they would be like these.</p>\n<p>Mist rose over the surface of the lake, quickly becoming opaque in the twilight. It seemed to hump itself up as something thrashed in the water, then swept in toward the town, breaking like a wave over the green. Something was moving in the fog, a large\xa0<em>flock</em>\xa0of some kind. There was an insectile chattering as\xa0<em>things</em>\xa0flew over them. Then just as suddenly as they had arrived, they swept back over the water. Through the mist a multitude of small lights gradually became visible.</p>\n<p>At the far end of Lake Till was the skyline of an enormous city, with towering skyscrapers blazing against the black sky.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461229/#Comment_461229" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-21T14:42:33+00:00" title="March 21, 2017  2:42PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Came So Far For Beauty (Part 7)</b>\n<p>The mist sprang up again. The crowd seemed to vanish around Temperance; she couldn't see any of her friends either. (Had she known it, each of them was similarly alone.) Ahead of her, the only thing she could make out in the thick fog was...a turnstile. It sat, completely incongruous in this featureless netherland, an ordinary mass-transit turnstile that would have been at home in any of the great metropolises of the world.\xa0</p>\n<p>She trembled, more in fear and shock than because of the clammy air. She pushed forward, into the gate, and heard the oddly comforting and oddly ominous grumbling as the bars clicked forward. Then she was through...</p>\n<p>For an instant she had a glimpse of a vast train station, a crystal ceiling at least a hundred feet above her, marble fixtures and an enormous departures board. Then a crowd of people rushed into her, pushing and pulling her along with them.\xa0<em>Just like rush hour in New York</em>, she thought in a flash as she was swept into a waiting train car.</p>\n<p>The doors slid shut behind her and she grabbed onto a nearby pole. There was a lurch and the train began to move forward, shooting out of the darkness through a tunnel and then out \xa0onto a broad, elevated track. Around her people were chattering in what at first was an unfamiliar language; but soon, with the logic of dreams, it became comprehensible.</p>\n<p>They looked like people. They looked like the people she might see on an elevated train anywhere in America, except that she saw every shade of skin possible (and a few she didn\u2019t think were possible) in the crowd around her. The men were wearing suits and hats that looked very much like fedoras, the women dresses or skirt suits. All of their outfits had something a little antique, a little outre, a little out-of-place: the chalkstripe suit of one man was purple, not black or grey; one woman had an enormous toucan pin perched on her shoulder, looking for all the world like an actual bird was sitting there. And they all wore masks.</p>\n<p>The masks had enormous variety, although most were of the type called\xa0<em>columbina</em>: porcelain or metal, covering the eyes, cheek and nose. Here and there she saw a few masks that covered the entire face, and a few people wearing only a petite domino. Several people gave her a dirty look; she was the only unmasked person in the car.</p>\n<p>Over the PA system came a voice she assumed was the conductor's: "This is the Orange Line to Palace Terminal,\xa0stopping at Uoht, Noatalba, Aldones, Aldones Plaza, Demhe Banks, and Palace Terminal. Uoht will be the next station stop. Uoht."</p>\n<p>She looked around in a daze. The train seemed very modern to her, much like the subway cars in New York City. Strange advertisements were held in the molding between the windows and the ceiling; the script resembled no characters she recognized, but much as the chatter around her had, they soon resolved in her mind to a readable state. The pictures were of products she recognized\u2014a coffee pot, a beauty cream, some kind of movie\u2014but the names were strange or completely nonsensical.</p>\n<p>Below her a twilight metropolis unfolded. To her right was a vast lake, so large that it went to the horizon. She could see a large suspension bridge to a rocky island that had some kind of large building complex on it; the lights were just turning on along the cables and towers of the bridge. The sun was somehow oranger than she thought the sun should be, and perched half-submerged at the rim of the world; above it was another sun, a glowing red coal that was also sinking to the horizon. Against the bright orange and yellow sky she saw dark pinpoints of\xa0<em>unlight</em>, like black stars caught in the firmament. To her left, the sky was already dark; brilliant stars were becoming visible, especially a bright red one, brighter by far than any star she'd ever seen, that seemed to hang from the zenith.</p>\n<p>A great city curled in a vast semicircle around one end of the lake. She could see broad avenues\u2014and narrow cobblestone streets\u2014vast parks purpling in the gloom\u2014broad plazas\u2014great towering skyscrapers in the center\u2014small dark tenements\u2014throngs moving down the boulevards\u2014children playing in the alleys...a great amalgam of every city she had known, full of the energy and vitality only an American metropolis seemed to have.</p>\n<p>And yet...the people in the car had a strange air about them, something more than just their alien clothes and habits. A suppressed anxiety and tension, as if tonight was important somehow. She craned her head around to look at the back of a tabloid a man was reading. Half of it, as she expected, was devoted to a sporting event although what it was she couldn't guess\u2014the headline, "Laht takes 7 chukka while saving a nelson in an all-outer"\u2014was gibberish. The front page, however, showed a blurry photograph of a figure in white robes hurrying down a street; the headline blared "<strong>PHANTOM OF TRUTH?</strong>" while the subhead assured everyone that the royal family was doing everything it could to protect the city.</p>\n<p>The name of the paper was the\xa0<em>Carcosa Evening Standard</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[BS Detector pegged the mood of the train, Notice got the headlines on the paper.]</em></p>\n<p>The train swept down its elevated course, heading straight at a large building that crouched over the right-of-way; they shot\xa0<em>through</em>\xa0it like a tunnel, the lights flickering. For a second she had a vision of ordinary life in Carcosa: a secretary packing up her purse and getting ready to leave, a man wearing a sad-eyed mask staring out of his office window and smoking a cigarette...the lights flickered on and off. And each time they came back on there were fewer people in the car.</p>\n<p>Suddenly there were two men wearing black suits at the end of the car. "Mr. Cable," said one to the other.</p>\n<p>"Mr. Lamp," said the other. "There's the intruder."</p>\n<p>Temperance stuck out her hand. "Take me to your leader," she said as confidently as she could manage.</p>\n<p>"We don't have orders to take you in," said \u2018Mr. Cable\u2019. "We have orders to stop you."</p>\n<p>"Oh..." said Temperance. The lights kept flickering...and each time the men were a little closer.</p>\n<p>"Demhe Banks coming up," said the conductor. Temperance turned and ran, banging open the door to the adjoining car and running through it. A little boy tugged at his mother's sleeve. "She's not wearing a mask!" he said. Temperance paused, then swept the mask off of his mother. She gasped and covered her face as Temperance sprinted to the next door.</p>\n<p>The lights flickered again. When they came back on, the car was empty. The two strange men were standing at the opposite end. Above the windows, all the advertisements had been replaced by the glowing, twisting Yellow Sign. "Stop," said one of the men.</p>\n<p>The train suddenly began to skid to halt. Temperance burst into the next car as the train shuddered to a halt and the doors slid open. "Demhe Banks," said the PA. She sprinted through the doors as they snapped shut behind her. As the train pulled away, she saw the two men pressed up against the windows of the doors.</p>\n<p>She sighed, and tied on her mask. She was standing on an open air platform, covered by a tiled roof. A set of stairs spiraled down from the platform. With a start she realized she was much closer to the lake now. In the fading light, what she took to be large seabirds were circling above the water.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461267/#Comment_461267" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T15:48:38+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  3:48PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Came So Far For Beauty (Part 8)</b>\n<p>Charleston pushed through the turnstile without hesitating. He could see it. He could see everything...</p>\n<p>...he was swept through the great train station and then with dream logic found himself standing on the sandy shore of the lake, looking almost directly into the sunset. He spun around slowly. A moon was rising behind him, in front of the city. Mist rose over the lake, sometimes rearing up like a wave. A long boardwalk curved to either side of him; boarded up kiosks and little shops lined it. Everything was a bit forlorn, dripping with moisture.</p>\n<p>When he turned back to face the suns, a figure was standing there. She was wearing rich robes out of some medieval pageant; her hair was bound up in a headdress like a crown. The whole effect was rather Chines; perhaps it was the red silk robes she was wearing. Her mask was ornate, faced in gold and lapis lazuli. But even so, he recognized her. Noor. Noor al-Buraki, his erstwhile friend and assistant, thirty years dead.</p>\n<p>Suddenly he realized this was the place he had dreamed of before.</p>\n<p>"Hello Charleston," she said in her familiar Egyptian accent.</p>\n<p>"Hello," he said, distracted. "Sorry, getting over the multiple suns."</p>\n<p>"It has been a long time."</p>\n<p>"It hasn't."</p>\n<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>\n<p>"I just had this dream a few months ago."</p>\n<p>"That's true, but it has been a long time since we saw each other."</p>\n<p>"Maybe for you.

Noor walked toward him and sat down on the edge of the boardwalk. He moved a little closer but remained standing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461268/#Comment_461268" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-22T15:49:03+00:00" title="March 22, 2017  3:49PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2017 3:27PM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Came So Far For Beauty (Part 8 cont'd)</b>\n<p>"I don't think it worked out all that well," he said.</p>\n<p>"No, not for me," she replied with an ambiguous smile. "I mean, I'm dead."</p>\n<p>"I went crazy, you went dead. Didn't seem to help either of us in the end. Helped some other people go crazy. Possibly crazier than me."</p>\n<p>"You did stop the Dark Lord, after all."</p>\n<p>"As much as I enjoyed that\u2014and to be honest, I really enjoyed that\u2014I don't think it really made much of a difference in the grand scheme. I'm sure he's still scurrying about somewhere."</p>\n<p>"I'm sure. But you stopped that plan, and that plan was very dangerous."</p>\n<p>"Wasn't much of a plan, either."</p>\n<p>"I suppose that's what the Dark Lord wanted people to think."</p>\n<p>"So this was all part of his plan?"</p>\n<p>"Who can say?"</p>\n<p>"Can I ask you a question? Where the hell am I?"</p>\n<p>"This is the city of Carcosa."</p>\n<p>"I don't know what that is, but it sounds familiar."</p>\n<p>"I'm sure we read about it. And, as is always the case when one arrives in Carcosa, we are here at the night the King in Yellow enters the city."</p>\n<p>"Isn't that every night?"</p>\n<p>"Yes, it is. But we are together for the first time so long." She reached out and took his hand into hers. He started back. "That's new!" he sputtered.</p>\n<p>"Of course I have physical form here. Don't be afraid. I am warm and alive...well, close enough for sorcerer's business."</p>\n<p>He tentatively reached out his hand and stroked her cheek. He slowly lifted the mask from her face, exposing the simple, open features of the Bedouin girl he had known so long ago. She blinked and took out a pair of thick horn-rimmed spectacles. She put them on, then took off her headdress.</p>\n<p>"This is so much more...this is better," he said.</p>\n<p>"You sound almost as if you missed me."</p>\n<p>"I thought if I did see you again, you would hate my guts. Because it's my fault you got turned inside out."</p>\n<p>"I think I had some say in that, didn't I?"</p>\n<p>"It's tough for me to remember that period of my life and think anyone was in charge except for me."</p>\n<p>"No, you were not always as much in charge as you thought you were."</p>\n<p>"I don't think I was\xa0<em>ever</em>\xa0in charge, in reality. But reality is a very soft thing."</p>\n<p>"Strange that you learned wisdom."</p>\n<p>"Got to break a few eggs to make an omelet."</p>\n<p>"I do want to know one thing, Charleston," she said, beaming and drawing him closer to her. "Why in all this time haven't you detected my bullshit?"</p>\n<p>The knife was in her hand as quick as thought. He felt it stabbing into his gut and chest as her other hand clenched like a vice with an inhuman strength around his wrist, holding him immobile. Finally she let go and he fell to the sand, bleeding profusely from many, many wounds. He was still clutching her mask in one hand.</p>\n<p>Noor had vanished. Instead, towering above him was a man in a tuxedo. The tie was undone and hung slackly around his neck. His face was indescribable. It contained cruelty and cold amusement and an infinite, infinite contempt. It seemed to gaze down from some incredible height, beyond understanding or sympathy. The man lit a cigarette and smiled.</p>\n<p>"Ah, Chuckles, it's been such a long time," said Nyarlathotep. "Do you know how hard it is to get into this place?"</p>\n<p>"For me it was easy," said Charleston, coughing. "Must have something you don't...besides a bunch of stab wounds."</p>\n<p>Nyarlathotep gazed out over the lake. "You know," he said almost wistfully, "for a long time I thought you and I would really have something together. Now you have about fifteen minutes before you bleed out. You see, I finally figured out something about you. I thought you were saying\xa0<em>no</em>\xa0to me because you were that strangest of all monkeys, the kind of monkey that could stand up on his hind legs and say 'No!' like Don Giovanni...ah, opera is lost on you. But now I understand that what you are, what you really are, is a goddamned coward."</p>\n<p>"You came all this way to tell me that?"</p>\n<p>"No, I came all this way to torture you." The Dark Lord threw his cigarette into the lake where it hissed. Something began to thrash the water in the place it fell, and he reached over, without moving, into the water and pulled some kind of gelatinous mass out of it. Charleston couldn't see what it was from his angle; he was flat on his back and in intense pain.</p>\n<p>"You ever wonder when you had your little gun, what those things were, where they came from?" said Nyarlathotep, quite casually. "Or ever let one grow up a little?"</p>\n<p>He stood above Charleston now, legs straddling his head, holding a squirming mass of tentacles, some kind of arachnid\xa0<em>thing</em>. "Open wide," he said with a malicious grin, and shoved the creature down Charleston's throat.\xa0</p>\n<p>He felt it crawl down into him sickeningly. Pain thrilled down every nerve; his stomach felt like it was erupting as tendrils burst through it and began to knit themselves to his bones, his muscles, his blood vessels...</p>\n<p>"Good news, bad news," said Mr. N, lighting another cigarette. "This thing can heal you. Bad news is, when it does, it will leak a little bit of itself into you."</p>\n<p>"Is it possible a little of me will leak into it?" Charleston coughed up a tentacle, and what looked like part of his liver.</p>\n<p>"Not really."</p>\n<p>"Are you just bitter because I stabbed you?"</p>\n<p>"Could be," sneered the man in the tux.\xa0</p>\n<p>"All these times I looked over my shoulder, you were never there," said Charleston. Black ichor leaked out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>"That was what made it fun. Speaking of which, I don't want to get in the way of tonight's entertainment. Quite the program."</p>\n<p>"You always think\xa0<em>you're</em>\xa0the program."</p>\n<p>"I\xa0<em>am</em>\xa0the program, Chuckles. Always have been. Ask your friend Jimmy about that."</p>\n<p>"He's not my friend!"</p>\n<p>"You're righter than you know about that. You'll find out. Spoilers. See you around, kid." The Dark Lord snatched a newspaper out of the thin air and threw it over Charleston's face. Of course it landed open to the funny papers; right in front of his nose was an amusing little strip where a comically drawn Chinese man was stabbed to death.</p>\n<p>He swept it off of his face and dragged himself up onto the boardwalk. There was no one else there.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461298/#Comment_461298" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-23T06:09:31+00:00" title="March 23, 2017  6:09AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard for N. to manifest in Carcosa?

In front of her was an enormous long, low building. It had a columned portico that swept in two wings along its vast facade. A broad set of stairs led up to the enormous bronze doors of the place; flanking these stairs were two huge recumbent statues of griffins holding bowls filled with fire in their front paws. The effect was almost like the New York Public Library built to the scale of St. Peter's Basilica.\xa0</p>\n<p>Above the door, carved in weird characters that quickly became comprehensible to her, was written: Royal Library of Carcosa.</p>\n<p>She climbed the steps in a dreamlike state. The doors proved easy to push open; they must have been counterweighted. Beyond them was a cavernous entry hall. Chandeliers of brass lamps hung forty or fifty feet in the air above her. She stared, open-mouthed, at the wonders of the place, until she heard a polite cough behind her.</p>\n<p>She turned and saw a young woman wearing a plain blue mask and a navy uniform of some kind. The woman started when she saw Candace's face. "You're...you're not wearing a mask."</p>\n<p>"Why would I be wearing a mask?" demanded Candace.</p>\n<p>The woman shook her head and opened a drawer in her desk. She handed Candace a simple black domino mask. "We keep a loaner here in case people lose theirs," she said apologetically. As soon as Candace had fastened it to her face, the woman's face lit up. "Oh! I didn't recognize you before! You must be here for your exhibit." She held up a flyer which advertised the Candace Heartbrooke room at the Royal Library.</p>\n<p>Still in a dreamlike daze, Candace followed the woman up a long central staircase to a beautifully decorated reading room. The walls held floor-to-ceiling bookcases. The woman indicated a button to Candace. "Ring the bell if you need anything," she said and backed out of the room.</p>\n<p>Candace examined some of the books. Her picture was on the back of them. She didn't recognize the title of the book, but it seemed to be written by her. She opened one of them to a random page:</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She stood in the library, looking around at all the books, her books, books she had yet to write, books she had yet to even\xa0<em>conceive</em>. And all in such a place of high honor! She couldn\u2019t help but feel a little giddy.</p>\nAs she stood in the room, she seemed to sense the presence of someone else\u2014dimly at first, but then stronger and stronger. She looked around, but there was no one there. And yet\u2026she couldn\u2019t help but feel that there\xa0<em>was</em>\xa0someone there, unseen, always behind her. It seemed to be getting closer and closer. She held her breath, but she could hear nothing. But there was a faint tickle at the back of her neck\u2026as if the hairs were standing on end and being disturbed by a faint breeze, or the breath of a loved one. She tensed herself, expectantly, waiting for the familiar touch\u2026<br/></blockquote>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>She looked up. She could feel something in the room. Something behind her. Something that reached out and gave her shoulder the gentlest of caresses, a touch both familiar and faintly sinister. And yet, she found herself thrilling to an awakening of her art, as if inspiration itself were touching her...</p>\n<p>There was a loud bang. The spell seemed to break. She looked up and saw a figure in a white robe flying out of the room. She ran through the door right behind it, pursuing the figure up and down long staircases and through dark, narrow passages. Always ahead of her she could hear the heavy tread of booted feet, even though she had long since lost sight of the figure. She pushed through some doors and came into a wide-open space...</p>\n<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461308/#Comment_461308" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-23T15:33:10+00:00" title="March 23, 2017  3:33PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2017 3:33PM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry broken edit caused this double post.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461332/#Comment_461332" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-24T14:48:24+00:00" title="March 24, 2017  2:48PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Came So Far For Beauty (Part 10)</b>\n<p>Jimmy pushed through the turnstile...</p>\n<p>...he and Betty were standing on a dark city street made up of dilapidated tenements and tired-looking storefronts. He saw a diner on the corner, filled with people wearing workaday clothes...and masks. He glanced down the street and saw a man walking a dog; both the dog and he were wearing a mask. Betty looked Jimmy askance.</p>\n<p>He began to stroll down the street. He noticed that the few people out and about would scurry away when they saw he wasn't wearing a mask.\xa0</p>\n<p>The sky bothered him. He'd always been interested in astronomy and years of living rough had made him familiar with the night sky. So the blazing red star at the zenith...that could only be Aldebaran...was far, far too close. He tried to remember the configuration of the stars above in case he ever got back to Earth and could access a celestial atlas.</p>\n<p><em>[Astronomy use here by JP.]</em></p>\n<p>He turned a corner and saw, halfway down the street, a neon sign hanging from the side of a building. It depicted a large eye that sometimes blinked; below, in the weird characters of Carcosa, it said "Private Investigations."</p>\n<p>"Might as well," he said to Betty. He went into the building and climbed the disheveled stairs, pushing through the office door on the second floor marked simply "P.I." Beyond it was a tired looking office, with the usual receptionist's desk and usual faded carpet and ratty chairs.</p>\n<p>A woman was sitting behind the desk filing her nails. She looked up at Jimmy as he walked in, and behind her mask her eyes registered surprise. She pressed a button on the intercom and said, "Boss? It's...him..."</p>\n<p>A wooden door with a pebbled glass window in it opened up and out stepped a man in a neat grey suit. He undid his mask, and Jimmy saw his own smiling face staring back. It seemed younger somehow or...no, that wasn't it: less weathered. Whoever this was, they hadn't had nearly as rough a time over the last twenty years.</p>\n<p><em>[2 point Stability loss here.]</em></p>\n<p>"Let me explain," said the man. "First, you should probably call me J. W. It will be much easier. See, the name I used to use kind of doesn't apply in this situation...old friend."</p>\n<p>Jimmy's jaw dropped.</p>\n<p>"I know what you're thinking," continued J. W. "Time was altered, lots of things were made to\xa0<em>never have been</em>, including the version of the Yithian Kakakatak that you used know. Think of me as an echo, placed here in Carcosa, a world outside of time..."</p>\n<p>Jimmy wrapped him up in a hug. "I know, I know," said J. W. "I feel the same way, pal. How you been?"</p>\n<p>"Lotta mileage."</p>\n<p>"I've been the same. Things are always the same here. Well, it's complicated. Carcosa doesn't exist in time the same way as your reality. We kind of stand...next to it. Whenever you come to Carcosa, it's always the same time: the evening of this day. What might actually happen can be different; but this night will always end with...Him arriving. Don't worry, if everything breaks right you should be able to get out ahead of that. Lots to do; we have to go to a museum."</p>\n<p>"So like old times."</p>\n<p>"I'm...not sure. I don't know what branch Kakakatak Prime sorted out. True or false: Ruby Fitzgibbons is the President of the United States of America?"</p>\n<p>"Horribly false."</p>\n<p>"Whew. Boy, you dodged a bullet there. Japan win or lose World War II?"</p>\n<p>"Lost."</p>\n<p>"Nuclear weapons?"</p>\n<p>"Yah."</p>\n<p>"No spoilers. Long-term, you're screwed. Anyway, my car is outside."</p>\n<p>"Is it armored?"</p>\n<p>"You kidding? We live in a bad neighborhood but it\u2019s not that bad. Like the dog, what's its name?"</p>\n<p>"Betty."</p>\n<p>"That's terrible. And funny. By the way you haven't met...the real Betty, have you?"</p>\n<p>"No."</p>\n<p>"That's good." They clomped down the stairs and walked over to J. W.'s car, a sleek thing that looked poured out of a science-fiction magazine from the 1930s. "We have a lot to catch up on," said J. W. as they climbed in. "But gotta go now. We'll never beat the Palace traffic otherwise."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461373/#Comment_461373" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T02:10:17+00:00" title="March 25, 2017  2:10AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of curiosity, what made the bang that interrupted Candace's contemplation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461374/#Comment_461374" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T03:43:19+00:00" title="March 25, 2017  3:43AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Stranger/Phantom of Truth leaving the room and the door banging shut behind them.

Ahead of her she saw a sandy beach and the vast sheet of water and mist that was Lake Hali. The larger of the two suns was setting, and the sky getting darker.\n<p>She saw a person crawling in the sand, and she approached him cautiously. "Charleston, is that you?" she said when she drew near.</p>\n<p>"Stay the hell away from me!"</p>\n<p>"That's Charleston. It's me, Temperance. Actual Temperance," she added as an afterthought.</p>\n<p>Charleston motioned her down and then reached up to feel her face. She pushed him back down and stared as his rent clothes and the stains of blood and ichor. She tried to probe the wounds but Charleston swept her hands away and stood up.</p>\n<p>"Charleston, you have eyes," she said. "Can you see?"</p>\n<p>"No," he replied, distracted. He swept up the shiny gold mask "Noor" had been wearing.</p>\n<p>"What happened to you?"</p>\n<p>"Nothing. What happened to you?"</p>\n<p>"Nothing happened to me, I'm not the one covered in...you can explain later..."</p>\n<p>"Let's get the hell out of here." This struck them as a good idea; something was bubbling out of the misty waves. It seemed to have tentacles.</p>\n<p>They limped up to the boardwalk, making sure they did not look back at whatever was coming up on the beach. Charleston looked at the city, lit up against the black sky in the west, with both his new eyes and his Third Eye. He only saw the visible forms with both; this vaguely relieved him, as he was sure the entire experience was being mediated somehow and the actual Carcosa was far more inhospitable to the human mind.</p>\n<p><em>[Cthulhu Mythos use here.]</em></p>\n<p>"You've been in the city?" he asked Temperance as they began to stagger down the boardwalk.</p>\n<p>"I was on a train, then I was attacked by those strange men in suits, then here."</p>\n<p>"I don't know what that means, but we're supposed to be in a city."</p>\n<p>"We are, it comes right up here."</p>\n<p>"Right up where?"</p>\n<p>"Oh dear. I think one of us is losing their minds."</p>\n<p>"I think we both are."</p>\n<p>"If you told me you can't see the city I would believe you because, A, you're blind, and B, this is not a normal place."</p>\n<p>"This isn't a normal place even for abnormal places."</p>\n<p>"Charleston, I need to know...is this what it's like to use a hallucinogen? I've never experimented like the others. Can you share a hallucination? Could we be the victims of some kind of drug attack, and we're still in that field?"</p>\n<p>"Of course, that's probably the most likely explanation," said Charleston in a way he thought was reassuring.</p>\n<p>"So it's not true then."</p>\n<p>"Temperance...human beings don't just grow eyes back. The only reasonable explanation is hallucinogens. Whenever you see anything you can't explain, that's the reason. I stake my reputation on this."</p>\n<p>Temperance looked askance. "I'm just eliminating possibilities. I can accept this as bizarre and strange if that is what it is; I just don't want to waste time chiseling out some weird sign in a wall if we're in fact in a field somewhere. Wasting time is wasting time."</p>\n<p><em>[TP, after Charleston's speech: Yeah, I have BS Detector.</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: TILT! TILT!]</em></p>\n<p>"I don't know what to tell you, Temperance. You're arguing with one of your hallucinations then."</p>\n<p>"I will throw you in the water with that\xa0<em>thing</em>," began Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Don't acknowledge the thing! Let's finish this argument inside the city."</p>\n<p>They made their way along the boardwalk. Out over the surface of the lake huge banks of mist would gather and rush toward shore, breaking like waves against the beach. The kiosks lining the boardwalk were all closed and locked up, forlorn in the gloom and covered in glistening droplets of condensation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461506/#Comment_461506" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-28T17:18:55+00:00" title="March 28, 2017  5:18PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Came So Far For Beauty (Part 12)</b>\n<p>As they rounded a curve, they saw a woman sitting at the end of a little pier that jutted out into the lake. She was wearing beautiful, well-made but antique clothes: a white silk dress trimmed in gold, ropes of thick gold chains around her neck, and a mask of porcelain and silver. Her hair was done up in an elaborate series of braids. Temperance thought it looked like a theatrical costume of some kind.</p>\n<p><em>[Art pegged that clue.]</em></p>\n<p>As they approached, the woman sang in a lovely soprano:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Along the shore, the cloud waves break,</p>\nThe twin suns sink behind the lake,\xa0<br/>The shadows lengthen\xa0<br/>in Carcosa...<br/></blockquote>\n<p>She stopped when she saw them. "Who are you?" she demanded. "Neither of those masks belong to you!"</p>\n<p>"None of your business," muttered Charleston. "People have to wear the mask they have."</p>\n<p>"You really are strangers," said the woman, surprised.</p>\n<p>"We think the same of you."</p>\n<p>"You don't know who I am?"</p>\n<p>"No."</p>\n<p>Temperance tried to say something, but the woman cut her off. "My name is Yolanda Lareine," she said. "I don't know who you are."</p>\n<p>"We're fans of a play," said Temperance. "We've come to Carcosa to watch it."</p>\n<p>"Oh! In that case you'll be wanting to go to the Palace." She smiled to herself and reached into her robe and took out several oblong pieces of stiff paper. "Sorry, didn't realize you were fans. Take these passes for tonight's performance. And since you're strangers in town and don't know your way around...Noss!"</p>\n<p>A man came down a flight of stairs, wearing a chauffeur's uniform. "Yes ma'am," he said, then stopped when he saw Charleston and Temperance.</p>\n<p>"We're new," said Temperance drily.</p>\n<p>"Clearly! So first stop is a mask shop, then we'll head to the Palace. Gotta stop at the Museum on the way to pick someone up." He led them up the stairs to a parking lot; the only car in it was a rather odd-looking long vehicle, evidently a limousine of some kind. It had a certain old-fashioned look about it, although it was sleek and futuristic in some ways; Temperance decided it was the kind of thing you might have seen on the cover of Amazing Stories back in the 1930s.</p>\n<p><em>[Carcosa is very retro-future. TP and I had a brief description of masks in Carcosa; it was evident to Temperance that the masks contained complex markers of class and faction, as well as revealing certain aspects of the wearer's personality. And of course, Carcosans couldn't recognize each other without their masks. "Carcosans as a people are given to rather heavy-handed metaphor," I said.]</em></p>\n<p>"You don't have to call me Mr. Noss or anything," said Noss as he opened the car. "It's just plain old Bill. I'll drive you done to Techarn's, he usually has a good selection. Probably really busy, it's a big night."</p>\n<p>"When was the last time you had a night this big?" asked Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Well, I work for Yolanda, everything is big with her."</p>\n<p><em>[I grinned at CP. "Good luck."]</em></p>\n<p>"Can you give us some help finding a mask...we don't want to look any more\u2014" began Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Ridiculous?" snorted Noss. "Hard to look more ridiculous than you do now. Like you're a dairy processor fourth class, lady."</p>\n<p>"What should we expect tonight? I don't want to do anything rude..."</p>\n<p>"Apparently there's a special guest at the performance, so who knows."</p>\n<p>"Big surprise at the end?"</p>\n<p>"We do like our spectacle. Tonight we're doing a play called\xa0<em>The Unanswered Question</em>."</p>\n<p>"What was the last play you did?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Does\xa0<em>East Side Story</em>\xa0sound familiar?"</p>\n<p>"Vaguely."</p>\n<p>They drove through the rapidly fading light, past the storefronts that poured golden light out onto the streets. Most were closing up for the evening, and the sidewalks were packed with throngs of people. Both Temperance and Charleston were picking up on a strange, electric sensation in the air; like the tenseness in the atmosphere before a summer thunderstorm.</p>\n<p>When they reached the mask store, the clerk had just put his hand to the "Closed" sign. He sighed, an in an accent that was surprisingly close to that of New York City, asked them what they wanted.</p>\n<p>"Busy day today?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Every day's busy."</p>\n<p><em>[Me: Keep trying, man.]</em></p>\n<p>"We need masks," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Do you have the paperwork? Of course not, you're strangers. Going to the Palace? Of course you are, strangers always go to the Palace. Have you see that Phantom of Truth? Nobody knows who that is." He handed Temperance a mask and turned to consider Charleston. "Your eyes weren't always green, were they?"</p>\n<p>"Of course they were," said Charleston dismissively.</p>\n<p>The clerk handed Charleston a harlequin mask.

They dashed through the entrance. Inside, the museum proved to contain wonders to delight and frighten...</p>\n<p>The entry hall was lined by massive statues that resembled, vaguely, the WPA style of the late 1930s: stylized, Art Decoish representations of the Queens of Carcosa. Their consorts were on the other side of the hallway in various poses. They heard a door bang and Jimmy saw Candace walk in.</p>\n<p>"Candace," he said, waving her over. "This is J.W."</p>\n<p>Candace stared somewhat agape.</p>\n<p>"I know what you're thinking," said J.W. "I'm better looking."</p>\n<p>"I think the only thing better looking than me is a baboon's ass, and it's a close call," muttered Jimmy.</p>\n<p>Candace noticed that between the statues there were paintings of people that looked like they could come from Earth; at least, they weren't wearing masks. As she approached, she saw they had little plaques and birth and death dates noted as "E.D." which she took to mean "Earth dating."</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Robert W.

The Museum didn't have the large, straight hallways linking exhibition halls they were used to back on Earth; instead, twisting and narrow passageways opened up from time to time into larger rooms. They were never sure of what to expect next: a grove of trees erupting out of the marble flooring, a room full of glass vitrines filled with seemingly-identical carvings of a goldfish out of marble, and everywhere bookcases, bookcases, bookcases. And the details of the exhibits themselves were strange: a suit of armor powered by steam, looming twelve feet high; a ship sailing across a desert under three suns; a room full of marionettes reenacting a ballet very similar to\xa0<em>The Rites of Spring</em>.\xa0</p>\n<p>And strangely enough there seemed to be some kind of afterhours party going on; they often passed little cabaret tables lit by candles or small lamps, surrounded by little knots of people in evening clothes, wearing their fanciest masks. There was an odd sounding music in the air\u2014something a little like atonal French jazz played by a Latin swing band. And everyone had that nervous, chattery despair that people get during moments of great national stress: Jimmy recognized it from people he saw in London during the Blitz.</p>\n<p>J.W. led them to the Hall of Weapons. It was filled with polearms, armor with spikes in unusual and anatomically dangerous areas (and armor for people with more limbs than customary in humans), unusual muskets with bizarre carvings.</p>\n<p>Jimmy lifted a polearm inquisitively. "Put that back!" barked J.W. "We don't have much time left. This is what we came for."</p>\n<p>He pointed to a long case lined with red velvet. Lying unsheathed in the case was a long single-edged sword: a scimitar of some kind. It took Jimmy a moment to recognize it: the Sword of Akmallah.</p>\n<p>"James," said J.W., "you know what that sword is, don't you?"</p>\n<p>"Extremely sharp," said Jimmy, staring at the blade.</p>\n<p>"You saw Freddie carry it. You saw Geronimo carry it. Don't you think...it's time for\xa0<em>you</em>\xa0to carry it?"</p>\n<p>Jimmy put his hand on the haft. "It fell outside of time," said J.W. softly, "and so it came to Carcosa, the world outside time."</p>\n<p>"I'm worried about the things I might do with it," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"The sword cuts both ways. Who do you think is better to carry it than you?"</p>\n<p>Jimmy lifted up the sword. Its blade flowed like water, flashing in the dim light, resolving into a well-balanced longsword with a simple crosshilt.</p>\n<p>"Now put that pigsticker away," said J.W., handing Jimmy the scabbard.\xa0</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461529/#Comment_461529" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-30T16:05:41+00:00" title="March 30, 2017  4:05PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Came So Far For Beauty (Part 14)</b>\n<p>Candace had wandered away from the boys and their toys some time before. She followed a narrow corridor until it suddenly opened onto the largest open space she had seen so far in the museum.</p>\n<p>It must have been a conservatory of some kind. A glass dome towered overhead, bigger than any she had ever seen, on the scale of St. Paul's or the Pantheon or the U.S. Capitol. She craned her neck back. Directly overhead was the angry red glare of Aldebaran, bright enough to cast faint shadows from the vegetation around her. It was almost night now; the stars were coming out, a spectacular scattering of light far denser than any nighttime sky she had seen on Earth; had Jimmy been there, he might have speculated that perhaps they were close to a star cluster, such as the Hyades. The moons were rising in front of the city. Somehow overhead she sensed the malevolence of the black stars, invisible now against the sky, circling warily.</p>\n<p>The air was heavy, steamy, and chokingly scented with a wild melange of tropical perfumes. Strange and exotic plants were everywhere she turned, many with night flowers that opened and displayed a sickly radiance. They were unusual colors, deep purples trimmed with gold, bright, bright blues, reds the color of innocent blood. She walked along the winding path until she reached the center of the room. She stopped short. A man was standing in front of her, holding a leatherbound book; he seemed to be gazing through the dome at the illuminated skyscrapers in the center of the city.</p>\n<p>He turned around and she realized it was Amadou Lalin. "Candace Heartbrooke," he said with a smile, holding out his hand. "We met at Asylum, back on Earth."</p>\n<p>"Yes, we did." She stared at his mask, which was made of leather dyed midnight black and outlined with a faint tracery of white or silver. He noticed her gaze and smiled again. "You should really get a better mask if you're going to stay her for a long time."</p>\n<p>She paused. Amadou seemed a different man in Carcosa: in control, present, alert. Whatever had been missing from his psyche, his\xa0<em>soul</em>\xa0on Earth was returned here.</p>\n<p>"I actually know some lovely places," he continued. "We can go after the play is done. Are you here for the play? Or to stay?"</p>\n<p>"For the play. Is it the play we saw at Asylum?"</p>\n<p>"Everything's the play. But there will be a performance to come. We all have a role. And they recur."</p>\n<p>"I'm not quite sure what mine is."</p>\n<p>"There's a certain amount of latitude that every performer has, don't you think? I've seen many different Lady Macbeths. Each one slightly changed. I've known many people who I hope will one day play my small part in this production. So it's not always easy to tell what your role is, that's true; but I think you have a place in this play. Yes. Most definitely."</p>\n<p>They sat down on a cast iron bench nestled under trees that bore a strange yellow fruit. "Did you see your book?" said Amadou. "You're held in great renown in Carcosa. Possibly because I liked you so much when I met you. Are you here with your friends?"</p>\n<p>"I'm not sure. I saw one just now."</p>\n<p>"Mr. Wright. And J.W., that scamp. Yithians are such funny people, when you get to know them. Most people don't know that about them. Wonderful sense of humor, not like the mi-go at all."</p>\n<p>"Yes," said Candace, mystified.</p>\n<p>"I think...your friends will be arriving soon. Perhaps we should go find Mr. Wright." He held out his book to her. "I like reading this book. It's the poems I haven't written yet. I guess I'm slightly sad about one thing: I won't write them now...not on Earth."</p>\n<p>"I guess if you don't return..."</p>\n<p>"I don't mean to return. What's on Earth for me? I missed my chance once before, I let Percy go. And I loved Percy very much; but I was too afraid then. Cowardice is not a good look. But now I am here, and have built all this."</p>\n<p>"You seem at home."</p>\n<p>"Yes, I do.

They came across Jimmy, holding a sword in a scabbard, walking out of a room full of obscure and bizarre weapons.</p>\n<p>"Hey, Mr. Wright," said Noss. "J.W."</p>\n<p>"Hiya Bill."</p>\n<p>"Who's that?" said Jimmy, alarmed.</p>\n<p>"That's just Bill Noss."</p>\n<p>"Mr. Wright," said Temperance, looking at both Jimmy and J.W.</p>\n<p>"I know, he's not wearing a mask, it's disgusting ain't it?" stage whispered Noss.</p>\n<p>"Keep talking and I'll take off your mask," said Jimmy darkly.</p>\n<p>"C'mon Mr. Wright, I can't afford too many masks on my salary. I'm just a working guy!"</p>\n<p>"Sorry," said Jimmy gruffly.</p>\n<p>"You probably need a drink. Let's go pick up Amadou."</p>\n<p>Noss led them to the Conservatory. Amadou looked up as they came into view. "Hello, everyone. Lovely night, isn't it?"</p>\n<p>"No," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Mr. Wright, why don't you like Carcosa? It's my heart's delight."</p>\n<p>"Well currently you and I have different hearts."</p>\n<p>"I haven't had a chance to sound out your heart yet, Mr. Wright. I suppose I could ask J.W...."</p>\n<p>"Nope," said J.W. firmly. "That would be cheating. Gotcha back, Jimmy." He glanced over at Charleston. "Oh, you brought\xa0<em>Chuckles</em>? Somebody was looking for you. He find you?"</p>\n<p>"Yeah. We had a rendez-vous."</p>\n<p>"Who was it?" said Jimmy</p>\n<p>"Nobody important."</p>\n<p>"We should get out of here."</p>\n<p>"Did Edie bring you? Or Nathan?" asked Amadou.</p>\n<p>"Lund, yeah."</p>\n<p>"I'm worried about Nathan. I think he's making a mistake. I warned him many times, but Quincy is...have you met him?"</p>\n<p>"Once," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"What was your impression of him?"</p>\n<p>"Amiable, but a little full of himself."</p>\n<p>"So accurate, then. I think he has made a very dangerous error. I think he thinks Hastur and the King are the same thing."</p>\n<p>"Are they not?"</p>\n<p>"Do you know your Rilke?"</p>\n<p>"Not really."</p>\n<p>"It's all in the\xa0<em>Duino Elegies</em>. Here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026Denn das Sch\xf6ne ist nichts</p>\nals des Schrecklichen Anfang, den wir noch gerade ertragen,<br/>und wir bewundern es so, weil es gelassen verschm\xe4ht,<br/>uns zu zerst\xf6ren\u2026<br/>\xa0<br/><em>For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror</em><br/><em>which we are barely able to endure and are awed</em><br/><em>because it serenely disdains to annihilate us.</em><br/></blockquote>\n<p>"That's Hastur: the terror behind beauty. Death in the bloom. Nature red in tooth and claw. Something raw, beyond understanding. As Rilke says elsewhere in that poem:\xa0<em>Ein jeder Engel ist schrecklich</em>: every angel is terrifying. That is how it must be; the terror of Hastur is inseperable from the angelic nature of the King. But at the same time they are separate..."</p>\n<p>He turned to Candace. "You've been touched by him," he said. "You know the inspiration brought by the King. But Hastur is also in that. The wild part, the unknowable. When you stand outside at night and look at the stars and are awed, you stand in the shadow of the King. When you look up into the heavens and are terrified by the empty void behind them, you stand in the shadow of Hastur. If you try to bring Hastur but expect the King...you have lost wisdom."</p>\n<p>He looked at them with sad resignation. "You did not know any of this, did you? Why then are you in my city?"</p>\n<p>"We got dragged along for the ride," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"We were looking for you," said Temperance.\xa0</p>\n<p>"We were hoping to find you before you got to the city," added Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"You were the girl who fought Edie!" said Amadou, eyes lighting up as he looked at Temperance.\xa0</p>\n<p>"Is the Palace a way out?" demanded Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"There's no way out of Carcosa except through it...but...yes, the Palace would lead the way."</p>\n<p>"Is this what you and the others at TAROT were trying to do?"</p>\n<p>"You know about TAROT...Percy stumbled into these things accidentally. But when he came through, and led us here\u2014of course, it was Percy's city and a very different place...he didn't know what to expect. It's why we researched these things, how we learned the spells to summon Hastur, like he did. That did not work very well. We also didn't expect the bomb that night."</p>\n<p>"Somewhere near Vegas in '53?" asked Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Indeed. The bomb...I don't want to say it interfered, but it came at a very inopportune moment. We only brought Hastur into the world for a very brief time. But I think he may have escaped our control. You need monoliths arranged in a V-shape when you summon Him."</p>\n<p>"I saw some of those," said Temperance. "At Chambersburg. Back on Earth."</p>\n<p><em>[Preparedness spend by TP.]</em></p>\n<p>"If Quincy is summoning Hastur into your world, but doesn't realize who he is bringing...he won't take the right precautions. You should try and stop him here, if you want to stop him that is. Bill, you should take us to the Palace."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461608/#Comment_461608" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-03T15:02:43+00:00" title="April  3, 2017  3:02PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Came So Far For Beauty (Part 16)</b>\n<p>Noss whisked them in his limousine through the dark and empty streets of the city. The twilight was rapidly fading. There was no one out on the sidewalks; the few lights left on in the buildings were even more forlorn because clearly they had been left on by mistake.\xa0</p>\n<p>The city was deserted. Everyone must now come to the Palace.</p>\n<p>They raced over the suspension bridge. Beneath them the dark waters of the Lake of Hali were thrashing in agitation; above the dark stars beat down their malevolence. Candace remembered her Milton:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames</p>\nNo light, but rather darkness visible<br/>Serv'd only to discover sights of woe\u2026<br/></blockquote>\n<p>They skidded down the ramp from the bridge and approached the Palace: a wedding cake confection of flying buttresses and towers, but even at this distance it was obvious that it was an enormous theater: Radio City Music Hall, built on the scale of the Louvre. Above the entrance a towering marquee rose into the night:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ONE NIGHT ONLY</p>\nTHE UNANSWERED QUESTION<br/>OR, THE STRANGER AND THE QUEEN<br/>BY AMADOU LALIN<br/>AND N.Q. LUND<br/>SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY<br/>EDIE MONTAGUE<br/>AND THE TATTERDEMALION KING<br/></blockquote>\n<p>Noss screeched to a stop below the marquee and pushed them quickly inside. There was a bored usherette standing at the other end of the lobby; velvet covered ropes had been strung from stands to block off the other entrances into the main auditorium. She threw her cigarette to the floor and ground it out as they approached.</p>\n<p>"Royal Box," she said, taking their passes. "Right up that way." She nodded to a sweeping curved staircase behind her, and they quickly moved up it. Candace threw a last glance back at the lobby before she reached the top of the stairs. The usherette was smoking again; but from underneath her mask, a single tear was rolling down her cheek.</p>\n<p>They followed a plushly carpeted hallway for what felt like miles until they came to their box. To their surprise, they found a few people already sitting in it that they recognized: Joy and John Harris from Chambersburg were there, without their children; a pompous college professor type Candace vaguely remembered seeing at the hotel; and Henry Lister, who was peering nervously around. He smiled at Jimmy. Joy looked over to Temperance and silently mouthed\xa0<em>Thank You</em>\xa0at her.</p>\n<p>"Quentin Spencer," said the professorial man, shaking Jimmy's hand vigorously. He stopped when he saw J.W. "Are you twins?"</p>\n<p>"I'm the older," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Clearly."</p>\n<p>"He's the alien remnant of an entity I wiped out of time," said Jimmy, hoping it would end the conversation. He looked out at the stage. Below, a performance of\xa0<em>The Unanswered Question</em>\xa0was taking place; but at a scale appropriate to Carcosa. The movie screen was bigger than a couple of football fields; the sets were built to a grandeur impossible to attain in any stage production on Broadway. In the pit a huge orchestra was playing symphonic music that was plain but engraved with deep lines of sorrow and misery. A woman with a prodigious soprano voice was singing a lament; Temperance and Charleston recognized her as Yolanda.</p>\n<p><em>[I listened quite often to Gorecki's Third Symphony "Sorrowful Songs" while writing my notes for this session; at this point I was playing an excerpt from Colin Stetson's fascinating reworking of the piece called "Sorrow".]</em></p>\n<p>The auditorium was gigantic. A sea of faces looked up at them. It seemed impossible that the entire city's population could fit inside a single building but that was the impression conveyed by this immense dim cavern of a room. The inhabitants of Carcosa, in their finery both familiar and strange, their masks and feathers, tiny children and aged grandparents, all, all, had the expression of shock and the gradual realization that something they had long dreaded but never believed to be actually possible was now somehow coming to pass. Something terrible, and unavoidable.</p>\n<p><em>[Psychology picked this up; it was Candace who got the clue. "We here on Earth know nothing about how\xa0</em>that<em>\xa0feels like.\u201d Have I mentioned that this session took place on the first Saturday after the 2016 US Presidential election?]</em></p>\n<p>From her seat, Candace could see a little into the wings of the theater. She say N. Quincy Lund standing there, wearing a really theatrical costume of yellow robes and a tinsel crown. He was pacing back and forth, smoking a cigar, giving the appearance of someone desperately trying to remember their lines.</p>\n<p>Charleston looked up into the darkness. Hanging somewhere up in the dark gloom that hid the ceiling were...things...somehow insectile, somehow human, chittering and hissing in the blackness. They reminded him of the things that had swarmed in the fog at Chambersburg. They reminded him of the agents that Jimmy had encountered in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>The music died down. Yolanda and another woman stood near the center of the stage. And Edie Montague, wearing long white robes, stood next to them. Somewhere deep offstage, a gong boomed.</p>\n<p>And everyone took off their masks.</p>\n<p>All of them; the actors and the musicians; the shopkeepers and soldiers; the children and their parents; young and old; rich and poor; the frightened, the humble, the sick, the lame, the strong, the weak, the blessed, the cursed. They stood blinking and naked in the dim lights of the auditorium, almost pathetic, almost wretched.</p>\n<p>Yolanda turned to Edie. "Come, sir, you should unmask."</p>\n<p>"Indeed?" said Edie. She took out something that glittered from underneath her robe and held it tightly in one hand.</p>\n<p>"Indeed. We have all laid aside disguise except for you."</p>\n<p>Edie took a deep breath before replying. "I wear no mask," she said, and unfolded the straight razor she held in her hand. She placed it along her ulnar bone, and then sliced deeply into it, a long cut parallel to the bone that she worked gradually up her arm, to her bicep, up over onto her shoulder..."I wear no mask," she said, gritting her jaw with pain. "I wear no mask," she repeated, working the razor around her neck, changing hands and then working it down her other arm, her sides, slicing down one leg and then the other...blood gushed from the wounds in sickening bursts, pooling blackly around her feet.</p>\n<p>"No mask?" said the woman standing next to Yolanda. "No mask!" Her voice was strangely familiar.</p>\n<p>"NO MASK!" shouted Edie, and stepped forward.</p>\n<p>The skin parted off of her body like a bathrobe. It curled up at her feet as she stood in the klieg lights screaming, "NO MASK! NO MASK!"</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461667/#Comment_461667" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T14:58:59+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  2:58PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Came So Far For Beauty (Part 17)</b>\n<p>As the audience gasped in shock, Jimmy saw Quincy Lund striding onto the stage. \xa0Charleston motioned up at the ceiling.

And she knew at that moment, as she stood in the presence of a monstrous deity, that everything she had once thought was true about religion was a hollow joke. For some reason a Bible verse kept running in her mind, over and over again: "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God..."</p>\n<p><em>[Temperance challenges her "God's words will put me back on the path Statement; this kept her Stability positive, but still cost 2 Sanity...]</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy looked up and saw the eyes of Hastur, a wave of destruction and malignance and was struck, once again, by the utter insignificance he held in the sight of the Outer Beings: that only the ritual had caused the incomprehensible intelligence of this entity to notice him even for a fraction of a moment. And he knew that the dangers they were facing were graver than he had dared let himself realize, that if Carcosa was intruding into their world that no one would ever be safe again, not even Janet who he had done everything to protect. He recalled that when Sol Molinari had told him about his experiments with Hastur that the world had convulsed, one step toward liberation, one step toward annihilation. Betty began barking and barking, dragging him by his pants cuff until he lowered his gaze and began to back into the city. The last he saw of Betty she was standing in the gloom cast by the immense column of water, barking furiously at him as if pleading for him to go...</p>\n<p><em>[Jimmy challenged his Drive (At least Janet is safe) and his Solace (Betty is always there for me when I need her).

He thought about Noor, not the imitation the Dark Lord had used to fool him, but the goofy, brilliant girl who had shared his passion for...well, this: the universal. His third eye violently opened, even without Yellow in his system, and he felt again the strange currents of the universe that he had once read like a sailor read the winds, carry him up again. How could he have ever thought he was a\xa0<em>normal person</em>? Hastur the Unspeakable had reached into his mind and rearranged it. And he knew, he\xa0<em>knew</em>\xa0that none of this had been chance: that as Amadou had said, he was playing a role in a work written by a greater playwright. His connections to the world, his way of hiding himself in the cracks of a humanity he no longer felt, crumbled apart like damp cardboard in his hands. Oddly, at this moment, he thought of Helen: realizing, maybe, that she was the one \xa0person in the world who would understand him...</p>\n<p><em>[CP challenged every statement on his sheet, but of course Sanity went down by 2...]</em></p>\n<p>Candace ran.

"This way, come on!" she kept shouting, until they all shook themselves out of their stupor and saw a few blocks away a set of stairs leading beneath the sidewalk. Behind them, the spell broke and the eyes went out and the wave collapsed. Dirty water flooded into the streets, rapidly rising to ankle level.</p>\n<p>As they fought through the current in this eternal final night of Carcosa, they all began to feel\xa0<em>pursued</em>, of something dreadful following them. Temperance thought she saw the flash a piece of yellow cloth, silk perhaps, dragged suddenly around a corner, and the crushing sense of something\xa0<em>watching</em>\xa0with cold amusement as they fled increased.</p>\n<p>Night had fallen. The King of Tatters was coming to claim his own.</p>\n<p>They slipped and stumbled down the water that rushed in a cascade down the subway steps. Yolanda was in the front, craning her neck behind her to plead in gasps with them. "You're taking me with you, right? Carcosa is a trap, you understand? It's a trap!"</p>\n<p>They reached the platform and leaped into the flooded trackway, pushing through the knee-deep waters down the dark tunnel. Charleston laughed as he gathered the eldritch energies all around them. "I've done this before, don't you see! Except this time we're the bullets!"</p>\n<p>Jimmy shoved his way forward. He caught up with Yolanda and dragged her behind him, followed by Candace who was pushing forward with grim determination. Temperance kept turning around to see if anything was following them. The water had risen up to her waist. She saw something crest out of the water for a second.</p>\n<p>The Byakhee were swimming behind them. Two jumped out of the water and grabbed with their rear claws onto a metal beam that supported the roof. In the dimness she thought she saw great wings unfold.</p>\n<p>Jimmy was wading up behind her, the Sword already in his hand. He slashed blindly out at them, trying to push it back into its companion...</p>\n<p>And that was when Charleston's spell went off.</p>\n<p><em>[I asked for tests/spends here; JP and HP did Athletics, CP Cthulhu Mythos, and since TP was out of Athletics, the spend was Notice. Jimmy's attack on the Byakhee got him a benefit, so JP chose "Suppress" to keep them from attacking.]</em></p>\n<p>It was like being squeezed through some ever contracting tube of muscle, so tight that it crushed the air out of them. Before their ribs splintered, they felt a sudden release and then felt cold air moving over them.\xa0</p>\n<p>They were on the shore of Lake Till. There was a crowd of the people of Chambersburg around them. And it was snowing.</p>\n<p>Behind them the water of the lake humped up for a second...</p>\n<p>...and then collapsed. A cold mist rolled over them. For a second they could see yellow flashes around the eyes of some of the people around them. Then the mist dissipated. In the heavens, the fiery glow of Aldebaran faded and then was hidden behind a cloud.</p>\n<p>Jimmy heard it first: the sound of heavy equipment moving toward the town. He thought of halftracks on Normandy beaches and began to shout for everyone to scatter. Not long after, the first gunshots rang out.</p>\n<p>They followed. Temperance got glimpses of men wearing military uniforms without any insignia she could see moving through the town, barking orders and yelling. They turned a corner and saw a young soldier holding a M-14 rifle.</p>\n<p>"Hold it right there!" he yelled nervously. "All of you! Nobody move!"</p>\n<p>"Stand down, soldier!" barked Jimmy, hoping to bluff him.</p>\n<p>"Just down on your knees!" Two other soldiers were closing in now that they could see him trying to apprehend people.</p>\n<p>Charleston saw the young soldier glance at them and struck out quicker than anyone could have thought possible. He pulled the rifle out of his hands, spun it, and then clocked the kid in the forehead with the butt. He yanked the magazine out and threw it away, then sped toward the RV. Temperance grabbed Charleston before he turned the last corner. Then she peeked around it.</p>\n<p>Two soldiers were standing guard next to the RV. Beyond them they could see most of the population of the town being herded onto the town green.</p>\n<p>Temperance pushed Jimmy to the ground and grabbed him by the shoulders and dragged him toward the the RV. "Help! Help! His pills are in the RV!"</p>\n<p>"You're under arrest, ma'am!" shouted one of the soldiers, leveling his rifle. "You too, hobo. Why are you wearing a mask, lady?"</p>\n<p>"I'm a veteran," gasped Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Look, mac, nobody's in trouble. We just need to sort this out...is that a sword?

The soldiers and some agents in civilian clothes were interviewing the townsfolk. Temperance saw Joy standing in line on the green, clutching her children to her. The snowfall had stopped, although it was still much colder than normal.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Mina sat down next to Temperance. "I know your mother doesn't think very highly of me anymore," she began without preamble. "Understand that we had to do what we had to do, and quite honestly there was nobody more qualified than me for the job. I do intend to look for ambitious and able young women for my organization; it's still a man's world, whatever darkness leaks in. The President always wants us to take on another FBI agent or a lunkhead from the Marines. This is my card. I think we could use someone like you."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The next day the Majestic-12 agents dumped them in the middle of Los Angeles.

It rumbled through the darkness, splashing mud as it wallowed in the dirt road. Rain fell in great sheets, and lightning flashed on the distant hills.\xa0</p>\n<p>In the cab, the driver petted his old basset hound and hummed a song he'd heard on the radio the other day; one of those new jazz pieces that had gotten so popular since the doughboys came home. He took another swig of Canadian whisky from his flask.</p>\n<p>Somebody walked out into the road in front of him.</p>\n<p>He slammed on the brakes, frantically downshifting as she stood senseless of her danger in the glare of the headlights. The truck skidded and shook to a stop less than a foot from what he saw now was a woman. She was wearing a white gown of some kind, with heavy ropes of chains and pendants hanging from her neck. Her back was to him, and he saw her reach up and unfasten something from her face.\xa0</p>\n<p>He rolled down the window. "Are you all right, miss? You better come inside and get dry."</p>\n<p>She stumbled in a daze to the other side of the truck and after a moment yanked open the door and climbed inside. "Don't mind ol' Jim there," said the man. "He's just an old coon dog." Jim bayed softly.</p>\n<p>The woman slowly turned to look at him, eyes blank and expressionless. "...dog..." she said.</p>\n<p>"Yeah, dog." The woman switched her empty gaze to him and he shuddered for some reason. "I don't know what your problem is, ma'am, but you're not the only one with troubles tonght. There's a big blackout in Los Angeles, power's down all over the area. Everything's all messed up. Hell of a way to start 1926, you ask me, two weeks in and we have this. Them's all messed up in that town."</p>\n<p>She blinked again, and then smiled. Her face seemed to change, become warmer, more open, more recognizable. "Like she pulled on a mask or something," he told his wife later, and shuddered when he did; the change was so sudden and severe.</p>\n<p>The strange woman leaned forward and petted Jim. "I thank you so kindly for the help," she said, in a voice with the same flat Oklahoma twang he had. "My head was just not here yet.

This mostly has to do with real life, prep for the two final sessions...and, well, some of these episodes aren't all that satisfying to me, personally. They went over fine, folks had a good time; but the middle act just didn't gel all that well in my eyes. There were also some creative clashes that resulted in one PC leaving the campaign.<br/><br/>But onward. Starting in Episode 8 I largely began writing my own scenarios, using some elements from published adventures (most especially Graham Walmsey's fine <i>The Final Revelation</i>) and things...improved a bit, although they remained somewhat railroady. This is a problem with the campaign as a design and my own GMing style in it; and it gave me some grief, which is another reason the middle sessions weren't quite up to my own standards, with the exception of the rollicking Episode 7.<br/><br/>All that said, everyone is enjoying the game quite a bit and I feel like we've earned its incredibly grim potential denouement.<br/><br/>Episode V is based on Oscar Rios' neat little New Orleans confection "Song and Dance" with some influence from "Tell Me, Have You Seen the Yellow Sign" by Kevin Ross.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463927/#Comment_463927" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-13T16:33:11+00:00" title="June 13, 2017  4:33PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2017 4:34PM by Aviatrix.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Act II: Lonesome Traveler (December 1955--October 1956)</b><br/><br/><br/><b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 1)</b>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then read me the list of the crimes that are mine</p>\nI will ask for the mercy that you love to decline\u2026<br/>\u2014Leonard Cohen<br/></blockquote>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The townhouse of Isabelle O'Donnell was in the French Quarter of New Orleans: an old brick building with a balcony running around the second floor. It was decorated in a tasteful mixture of old Louisianan and modern French styles. Local wags liked to insinuate that it had once been a bordello, but in truth it was nothing more romantic than a repurposed warehouse.</p>\n<p>Jimmy and his friends had arrived in the middle of the month, with Temperance\u2019s two half-siblings, Rodolfo and Charlotte (everyone called them Rudy and Charlie) in tow; they had been inflicted on her by her mother, who needed some time off. Typical.</p>\n<p>It was a warm Christmas, but that seemed restful after the unseasonable (and alien) cold they had encountered in California. Mrs. O'Donnell was a charming hostess, with a small but dedicated staff of servants, and they made sure to give the best a Southern Christmas could offer to Jimmy and his friends. As a present, Candace gave Temperance an invisible ink pen.</p>\n<p>"A girl has secrets," she said.</p>\n<p>The day after Boxing Day, Jimmy found himself drinking coffee with Isabelle in the parlor. She preferred her coffee strong enough to chip paint off a battleship; she apologized to him about it, noting that her condition only allowed her to taste the strongest flavors.</p>\n<p>"Actually, I was going to ask for a bigger cup," said Jimmy. "No need to explain. Seems you're doing well."</p>\n<p>"Francis is away from home more than I would like. Do you remember Seamus and Sean, who worked for that Irish newspaper in Paris? They're both here as well; Seamus has a small farm outside the city, and Sean lives in town. They both married lovely American girls and have families...of course, they have to deal with their own condition, but the children did not inherit it."</p>\n<p>"It's a full moon tomorrow, right?"</p>\n<p>"Don't worry about it. Are you working on something? I've heard rumors."</p>\n<p>"Bradley dragged me into something."</p>\n<p>"Should I be worried?"</p>\n<p>"It involves the King in Yellow."</p>\n<p>"Oh dear. I read that play once. Very boring."</p>\n<p>"In the course of events we found ourselves in Carcosa. We escaped..."</p>\n<p>"I hope you did. Carcosa is a city that tries to hold onto its secrets. Ah, well. If you would like help with your costumes for the ball tomorrow, I have a wonderful woman who can make them for you and your friends. They are such charming people. Beth reminds me of someone, but I don't know who...ah, Freddy's friend. Sheila. Abigail. Audrey..."</p>\n<p>"I hope she doesn't follow her into attempted murder..."</p>\n<p>"If we are fair, she only attempted to murder Freddie," said Isabelle with a grin.</p>\n<p>"I hope not to be Freddie in this. By the way, do you know Etienne Laurent de Marigny?"</p>\n<p>"Etienne? Oh, yes. He's mostly retired these days...well, I suppose as retired as you. I would be happy to make an introduction. He is very knowledgeable about things...such as what you are looking into."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance was at Mass that morning. Of course she was. Beyond her ordinary devotion, she wanted to be around people who were quiet, respectful, and sane.</p>\n<p>She went to weekday Mass a lot.</p>\n<p>She was listening the offertory music\u2014one of the reasons she liked this church was the beautiful organ music they played\u2014but today she couldn't help notice that the music sounded strangely...discordant. She glanced around her. She seemed to be the only person who had noticed.</p>\n<p>The music stopped and she felt as if someone was watching her. She turned and saw the organist descending from his loft. He was tall, thin, and extremely pale, with a bald head that gleamed in the light. She caught his gaze and was astonished by the look of pure hate he shot at her. She watched as he swept in his black cassock to a side door and vanished.</p>\n<p>After the benediction, she pushed her way through the crowd. She saw the organist following her, so she walked quickly to a bench at a bus stop. She sat down next to an empty space as an invitation.</p>\n<p>A bus drove by, blocking her view of the opposite side of the street. When it drove away, she suddenly saw the organist staring at her with that same venomous look.</p>\n<p><em>[This was an actual Stability Test here, a somewhat rare mechanic in my games. This encounter is of course based on the Chambers short stor \u201cThe Court of the Dragon\u201d]</em></p>\n<p>She jumped up and began to cross the street. The man turned away and began walking rapidly up the street. She tailed him as close as she dared, and she saw him turn down an alley.</p>\n<p>She followed. The alley was blind, with no exit; but she didn't see him anywhere as she walked down it. She turned around.</p>\n<p>The man was standing at the entrance of the alley. He began to move toward her.</p>\n<p>"Who are you and what do you want?" she demanded.</p>\n<p>He kept moving forward in silence. She pulled out her gun. "I won't fire a warning shot!" she said.</p>\n<p>He kept moving, silently, toward her. He raised his arms as he got near.</p>\n<p>She shot him through the heart. He <em>kept moving</em>, wrapping his hands around her throat with shocking strength. As she dropped her gun and saw blackness coming in from the edges of her vision, the man whispered in a horrible voice edged with malice and full of the subsonics of despair, "It is a frightful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God..."</p>\n<p>She awoke with a start. She was sitting in her pew; she had dropped her missalette. The elderly Creole woman next to her was giving her a disapproving stare for having fallen asleep during Mass.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463959/#Comment_463959" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T15:21:38+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  3:21PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 2)</b>\n<p>Charleston had been spending the holiday trying to worm his way into the local occult community. As expected, it was large in New Orleans, but very clannish and fractured. The intricacies of the Southern racial castes also threw him; he wasn't familiar with the differences between Creoles, whites, and blacks. But his work had uncovered two young scions of black Creole families who were expected at Isabelle's ball: Collette Lamar and Nicole Savoy.</p>\n<p>The balls! They were going to be his best bet to meet the occult society of the city, for the last four days of the year were filled with four of them, on successive nights, the <em>Bals d'Indulgences</em>: the <em>Bal des Innocents</em> tomorrow night, where young occult New Orleansians made their debut; the <em>Bal des Debauches</em>, where anything might and often did happen; the <em>Bal des Mortes</em>, a rather sedate black tie affair mostly dedicated to planning for the next year; and finally the <em>Bal des Monstres</em> on New Year's Eve, the only one attended by "normal" citizens of the Crescent City.</p>\n<p>They sounded like quite a party...on any number of levels.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Candace spent much of her time with Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady, who had helped drive out from California. They took her on a whirlwind tour of the dives and low areas of the city, introducing her to other writers and getting her howlingly drunk and high on life and chemicals. One of the writers she met was their friend Bill Burroughs, a dour-faced tall man who was an obvious hophead. They talked shop.</p>\n<p>"My current novel is something very different from my first book," said Candace. "I feel I've really evolved."</p>\n<p>"I'm working on something very big," said Burroughs. "I'll probably have to cut it down for publication...if it is even publishable."</p>\n<p>"Oh, it should be published in its full form."</p>\n<p>"It would be too long and nobody would understand it."</p>\n<p>"Does anyone really understand the heart of a writer?"</p>\n<p>"How perceptive. You should maybe visit me in Morocco sometime."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Sam had returned to them somewhat unexpectedly, showing up without preamble just before they'd left California. Now he was working on digging up some information on the members of Project TAROT; he'd been in Paperclip, and hoped he might uncover some stuff, especially about Barbara Miller, who seemed to have been Percy's number two. He invited Jimmy to have a drink with him and talk over what they knew.</p>\n<p>"We should check out that place that the second ball is going to be at," said Sam. "This Caf\xe9 Hippolyte."</p>\n<p>Jimmy winced. "I don't trust places with names like that. It's probably just a coincidence. Let's just go someplace close." Sam shrugged and they walked over to a corner bar.</p>\n<p>"I want to talk about Percy," said Sam when they had gotten settled. "Been a while since we talked about him."</p>\n<p>"Yes, what with him no longer being human."</p>\n<p>"A lot has happened since we were in Vegas. I've been working...on various projects."</p>\n<p>"I think he was trying to find a way into Carcosa."</p>\n<p>"Why would anyone want to find a way there?"</p>\n<p>"I am not one of those people, so I can't explain."</p>\n<p>"There are a lot of realms it might be beneficial to visit," said Sam with visible longing in his eyes, "but I don't think Carcosa is one of them."</p>\n<p>"Carcosa...shapes itself to whoever creates it. I don't know exactly how that works, whether or not there are multiple phases of it..."</p>\n<p>"Does that mean that if you or I create Carcosa it would be our own?"</p>\n<p>"It would be different. Amadou stayed there and his was different than Percy's."</p>\n<p>"Is it possible to create multiple Carcosas? Or is there only one at a time?"</p>\n<p>"My grasp on physics has been passed by theory."</p>\n<p>"What I am saying is that maybe we could create a better Carcosa of our own..."</p>\n<p>"We are talking about eldritch beings. I doubt there is a <em>better</em> Carcosa. Maybe a less bad one. Amadou wrote a book about it, <em>The Wanderer on the Lake</em> I think. Temperance has a copy. But you'll have to deal with the god Hastur if you try this; he always comes at the end of the night."</p>\n<p>"What if we could create our own Carcosas, in our own image? Maybe we could avoid these mistakes."</p>\n<p>Jimmy looked at him a bit incredulously, and finished his drink quickly.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance came awake quickly to the sound of muffled screams. She flipped on the light and looked across the room to the other bed. Beth was rolling in an agitated fashion under the covers; suddenly she sat bolt upright and said, "No!" in a loud voice. She blinked painfully in the light. Without her glasses she looked far away and lost.</p>\n<p>"Sorry," she said. "I was having a bad dream. People were trying to kill me. There was this horrible man. He had something wrong with his face...no...wait...he wasn't bad." She shook her head. "I don't remember."</p>\n<p>"I had a terrible dream last, uh, night," said Temperance, hurrying past the lie.</p>\n<p>"Didn't those actors say they had bad dreams after they made the movie? Is that happening to us?"</p>\n<p>"Maybe it's just nerves. It has been quite an ordeal."</p>\n<p>"What are you going to wear to the ball tomorrow?"</p>\n<p>"I went out with Rudy and Charlie today," said Temperance, referring to her half-siblings who were visiting from California. "I picked us all out something special."</p>\n<p>"Can't wait to see it," said Beth drowsily.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464027/#Comment_464027" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T15:08:20+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  3:08PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 3)</b>\n<p>The next night the first Ball was held at Isabelle's house. Candace came dressed as Calliope, Muse of Epic Poetry: a long white chiton and a crown of tinsel leaves. Temperance was dressed as Wonder Woman. Rudy was dressed as Batman and Charlie as Robin.</p>\n<p>"We always thought of you as a bit of prude," said Charlie approvingly. "No fun...pious...it's really strange that you're not Geronimo's daughter, actually."</p>\n<p><em>[TP: Two Sanity points ago Temperance wouldn't dress like that.

Who was dressed as Alice in Wonderland.</p>\n<p>"Why is one hand bandaged?"</p>\n<p>"I'm the rest of rabbit."</p>\n<p>Sam came out in a white lab coat and a thick German accent. "Von Braun!" exclaimed Beth with a cackle. "Oh, that's great! He's such an asshole!"</p>\n<p>Charleston came dressed as the 1930s serial version of Buck Rogers. "Deep cut," he explained to anyone who asked, and then got annoyed when so few people asked.</p>\n<p>Isabelle O'Donnell was dressed as the Bride of Frankenstein, which caused Jimmy to chuckle. "Private joke," he explained again to Beth. Her two associates Seamus and Sean arrived wearing puppy dog masks\u2014another private joke.</p>\n<p>"How'ye doin', yeh old bastid?" said Seamus. "I heard you died."</p>\n<p>"Heard that too," said Sean. "In Kilkenny."</p>\n<p>"I heard Cork," said Seamus.</p>\n<p>"I'm still kicking," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Thought the Germans would have blown you up, or the Japanese."</p>\n<p>"Or the Americans, ta be fair," put in Sean.</p>\n<p>"There were always a bit of explosions nearby, but I managed to keep out of the blast radius."</p>\n<p>"I see ye brought crazypants," said Seamus, pointing at Charleston.</p>\n<p>"He's a little...less unhinged."</p>\n<p>"That still leaves a lot of room between him and <em>sane</em>. He doesn't still think he's a preacher man a' color anymore, do he?"</p>\n<p>"The less said about that the better. I hear you're both family men now?"</p>\n<p>"Aye, they're all wonderful. Here are the gals now. They know about our condition, but American girls, they're acceptin' of most anything."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Isabelle, who was at core a Frenchwoman of the 1920s, had a small jazz band playing in the corner and was steadfastly ignoring how Charlie had spiked the punch. Candace saw two young black Creoles come in dressed as muses.</p>\n<p>"Which one are you," said one of them to her.</p>\n<p>"Calliope."</p>\n<p>"Oh, good. I'm Euterpe and this is Terpsichore. Or Collette Lamar and Nicole Savoy, if you prefer." Their costumes were immaculate, gorgeous white gowns, their black curls piled high into an elaborate hairstyle that included small masks as part of the effect. "You're not from here originally, are you?"</p>\n<p>"Boston," said Candace, suddenly self-conscious about her accent.</p>\n<p>"We're hoping to win the contest tonight. If we do we get to set the costume theme for our krewe this year, the Krewe Janus. What do you do?"</p>\n<p>"I'm a writer."</p>\n<p>"How appropriate!" The girls exchanged a knowing glance that Candace could read: <em>we're pulling this off better than you</em>.</p>\n<p>Helen picked Charleston's sleeve. "Over there," she hissed. "Them two girls you were interested in. Why don't you use those eyes of yours, now that you've got them again?"</p>\n<p>"It's our secret, my dear," he replied, looking at her over his dark glasses. They're only for you."</p>\n<p>"I do like you in green."</p>\n<p>Charleston ambled over, clutching the "ray gun" he'd made out of an old coffee can. "Hello, ladies."</p>\n<p>"Wow," said Nicole. "I haven't seen anyone do Flash Gordon in a long time."</p>\n<p>"Flash...yes. well, nothing like the classics. Everything old is new again."</p>\n<p>Nicole noticed his glasses for the first time and was a bit abashed, but Charleston waved it off with a smile. "Well, I'm the Muse of Song, so you only need to hear me," she said, smiling.</p>\n<p>Indeed, said Charleston, he'd come to New Orleans for the music; he'd heard it was amazing. "<em>Sans doute</em>," said Nicole. Charleston asked if it was true that music could have profound effects.</p>\n<p>"Only if you listen to the right song," said Nicole. "I think everyone is going to be listening to us tonight, and we're going to win the contest."</p>\n<p>"I still think you should have gone as John Carter," said Helen to Charleston. "Where I'm from, he's huge. Half the kids dress up as him at Halloween."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy cruised the edges of the crowd. He saw Rudy trying to leave out the backdoor. He collared the kid.</p>\n<p>"Leggo, old man," said Rudy. He did a double-take. "Wait...are you <em>that</em> Jimmy? If you are, I heard you used to be a lot more interesting. And that you died in Topeka."</p>\n<p>"I've died in a lot of places, kid," said Jimmy, pulling Rudy back into the ballroom. It was almost midnight. He could see Nicole and Collette standing in the middle of the room, trying to get everyone's attention. They pulled their masks down over their faces...</p>\n<p>...and collapsed in a dead faint. The music crashed to a halt. One of the musicians let his clarinet slip from lifeless fingers. "I can't play," he said in bewildered horror. "I got...nothing..."</p>\n<p>Candace felt as if some dark fog was washing in a horrid tide over her mind. The lights seemed to dim. She felt horrible, bereft: because all her inspiration seemed to have vanished in a moment, crushing her spirits under a vast weight. She saw Temperance stagger; clearly she'd felt the same thing happening.</p>\n<p>"I tasted it," she muttered. "Now it's gone. Ashes, ashes, my book is ashes..."</p>\n<p>Helen was weeping. She collapsed onto Charleston. "It's over, over, all gone...you wouldn't understand..."</p>\n<p><em>[This was a 3 point Stability loss to anyone with Art 1+]</em></p>\n<p>Sam was examining the girls. "Pulse weak and thready," he said to Charleston. "Fixed pupils. I probably have something for this."</p>\n<p>"I'm sure you do," muttered Charleston. He pulled off Collette's mask, but it had no effect.</p>\n<p>"Should we take them to the hospital?" said Isabelle.</p>\n<p>"We don't know what is wrong. You should get them someplace to lie down."</p>\n<p>"<em>Absolutement</em>." She waved at some servants, who carried the girls upstairs. "What do you think happened?"</p>\n<p>"Partying too hard? Too much excitement?"</p>\n<p>"I've lived here close to thirty years. I have seen partying. It doesn't usually end like this!"</p>\n<p>"So you want to start a panic?"</p>\n<p>"No! Of course not!

He took several hours to arrive. "It has been quite a night young miss," he said when he finally arrived: a pleasant sounding man with silver hair. "Many calls came in quite suddenly. I've had two suicide attempts this evening."</p>\n<p>He examined the girls. "If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say they'd had a <em>stroke</em>."</p>\n<p>"Simultaneously?"</p>\n<p>"Perhaps they ingested some substance." Sam edged toward the door.</p>\n<p>Jimmy slipped behind Charleston. "I think these girls bit off more than they can chew. Can you see any...you know...woo-woo-woo stuff?"</p>\n<p>"Decades after decades of this stuff and its still <em>woowoowoo</em> stuff, eh?" Charleston opened his Third Eye. The room practically glowed with power: tendrils wrapped the two girls and spread out across the city.</p>\n<p>Jimmy studied his face. "So they did something stupid."</p>\n<p>"We may have an...unexpected guest." The girls had summoned <em>something</em>. But nothing that he was familiar with... "If I were to hazard a guess, they summoned a spirit to possess themselves or someone else. A loa, perhaps."</p>\n<p>"And this spirit came from where?" asked Sam.</p>\n<p>"Lots of places possible," muttered Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"I see two paths," said Charleston. "We can try to follow the trail back to what they summoned, or we can try to break the spell and release them. Unfortunately I don't know how to do either."</p>\n<p>They argued for a while about what to do, pointing out that they had put on masks...was that important? Or was it the time? Charleston left the amateurs and went to find Helen.</p>\n<p>He found her in her room. She had shot up all her supply of Yellow. And all his. He shook her awake.</p>\n<p>"It did nothing...nothing..." she croaked, and then passed out.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The next day the newspapers were full of stories of the unexpected suicides of many local artists, and notices that every live act in the city was cancelled. The girls remained comatose.</p>\n<p>"We will have to play recorded music at the ball tonight," grumbled Isabelle over coffee, while the rest of them resumed their argument over what to do. Sam wanted to get some Yellow, so he and Charleston headed out to find some.</p>\n<p>They turned up a dealer by the levee. "Ain't none to sell you," he told them. "I got smack if you want that, but every grain of Yellow's been bought up. Can't find a gram of it anywhere in the city. Didn't seem to help them; they kept coming back for more."</p>\n<p>Back at the townhouse, Beth pointed out that things were a) terrible b) the kind of thing that Percy would have been interested in and c) a chance to do a very interesting natural experiment. Jimmy shook his head and he and Charleston went to talk to the Lamar and Savoy families, who were sitting nervously in the parlor.</p>\n<p>Jimmy raised the question of searching the girls' rooms back at their homes.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Lamar was indignant. These girls were not common musicians; there could be no reason for them to be affected in the same way as those misfits.

It was soon apparent to Candace that the families were voodoo aristocracy of New Orleans. Jimmy found Nicole's diary in the very clever spot nobody would ever look, in the closet.

Cabaret tables were strewn around the room; there was a wet bar and a coffee bar. And on the stage was a woman who was singing.</p>\n<p>She had a caf\xe9 au lait complexion and was wearing a sparkling champagne-colored evening gown, singing blues standards without any accompaniment. She was probably the only performer in New Orleans this evening, Temperance thought to herself. It was difficult to track her musical style since she was singing a cappella, but she was sure that the singer wasn't always using normal Western tonality.</p>\n<p><em>[Art History.]</em></p>\n<p>Candace dropped heavily onto a barstool. The saloonkeeper, a youngish looking woman with her hair in a flapper's bob, drifted over. "What can I get you, honey?"</p>\n<p>Candace sighed. "What's the specialty of the house?" she said without any enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>"Depends. You want to feel awake, or <em>good</em>?"</p>\n<p>"Good. I want to feel good."</p>\n<p>"Then hurricanes all around. My name's Hypatia; I run this place."</p>\n<p>"Beautiful name."</p>\n<p>"Certainly a storied one. What do you do?"</p>\n<p>Candace indicated she was a writer, and mentioned the new book she was working on. "Probably not going too well today," said Hypatia.</p>\n<p>"Taking a break."</p>\n<p>"You and everyone else in the city, except for Queenie here. She's...unusual."</p>\n<p>"Her music sounds experimental."</p>\n<p>"You could say that. Seems to me that someone has their eye on you\u2014nobody here. You're missing someone, aren't you?"</p>\n<p>"My husband. But it hasn't bothered me for a while."</p>\n<p>"Men, right? But it's somebody else. Don't worry. You'll be fine."</p>\n<p>"I can handle it."</p>\n<p>"I said the exact same thing once," said Hypatia, lighting a cigarette in a long ivory holder. "Different party than the one you're dealing with. And you know what? I was right."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Charleston ordered some coffee\u2014dark as night, plenty of cream and sugar\u2014and sat down to watch Queenie singing. With his second sight, he could tell that she wasn't affected by whatever was plaguing the city; it was as if she could draw inspiration from another source. He sipped his coffee meditatively and gave a standing ovation when she finished her set.</p>\n<p>Jimmy was asking the waitresses about Nicole and Colette; they had both been regulars, often talking to the boss: "She's a great supporter of young women," one said breathlessly.</p>\n<p>Sam was chatting up the drug dealers. "Yellow is impossible to get," they told him. It wasn't lack of will; it was just that every poet, dancer, singer and musician in the city had tried to score. "I'd charge you a hundred bucks a hit if I could," one said. "And I would. But there's none to be had."</p>\n<p>"Surely you have more coming in," said Sam.</p>\n<p>The supply chain was very chaotic, it seemed; the dealers were contacted by their source, never the other way around. But they didn't care, since the markup was so high.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance was sitting at the coffee bar. A woman in a bob haircut came by to freshen her cup. "Hypatia Masters," she said.</p>\n<p><em>[Yup, the same from </em>Masks of Nyarlathotep.<em> As I am not a fan of her fate in that campaign, when I ran it I made into some kind of powerful figure, having made a deal with Nyarlathotep\u2026somehow.]</em></p>\n<p>"Temperance."</p>\n<p>"Well-named. But don't you ever want to just let go? When I was your age, I used to hit every jazz club in New York."</p>\n<p>"I can understand. I've been to several clubs recently. Jazz is becoming a hobby for me."</p>\n<p>"A hobby? Listen, I understand you want to do things <em>temperately</em> if you will, but jazz is not something you can do by half-measures. You either got to give yourself to it or not bother."</p>\n<p>"I've heard a lot of artists say that, but I don't know what they mean."</p>\n<p>"You don't know...have you ever cared about anything in your life?"</p>\n<p>"Of course. I love the arts..."</p>\n<p>"I know, I know. You go into a museum and stare at paintings. But do you paint yourself?"</p>\n<p>"Once or twice. I have a sketchbook..."</p>\n<p>"Art isn't all inspiration. Leonardo worked his ass off, and I would know."</p>\n<p>"Are you a...fan of his?" asked Temperance, twigging to the last part of what Hypatia had said.</p>\n<p>"Very much. I don't think he was a fan of me. A homosexual is what I mean."</p>\n<p>"I've met some of them recently too."</p>\n<p>"Just <em>met</em>? Quelle dommage. Oh, sweetheart. No half-measures! I mean, I know you go to church, but are you going to church because you really believe, or because you're Catholic and works not faith and all."</p>\n<p>"How do you know I go to..."</p>\n<p>"It's all over your face. I can smell the incense coming off of you. It's not a good look. Haven't you ever danced? Haven't you ever kissed someone? Haven't you\u2014oh my God, you haven't! I didn't think they still <em>made</em> 24 year old virgins. I can help you. I will help you! I said I wouldn't do this anymore but..." She touched Temperance on the lips with one finger. "Say no more."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464229/#Comment_464229" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-21T15:03:22+00:00" title="June 21, 2017  3:03PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 6)</b>\n<p>While he was clapping, Charleston felt Hypatia loom up behind him. "Oh Chuckles," she said. "You're so <em>naked</em>."</p>\n<p>"Trying to appreciate this."</p>\n<p>"Which part are you trying to <em>appreciate</em>?"</p>\n<p>"That she can still perform at all. Tremendous. Tremendous!"</p>\n<p>"What are you doing in my club? You know I throw people like you out."</p>\n<p>"You're acting like it was <em>my</em> fault that your place in Paris got blown up."</p>\n<p>"No, that was Eddie."</p>\n<p>"He got his."</p>\n<p>"I know. I keep track of these things. But you hung up your sorcerer's license when you came in here."</p>\n<p>"Hung it up long ago."</p>\n<p>"If you want to talk to Queenie, you have five minutes."</p>\n<p>"I see the relationship here."</p>\n<p>Hypatia frowned. "She needed a place to sing, I let her sing here. I look out for ladies, somebody has to."</p>\n<p>"I could actually use your advice about\u2014" began Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Your little extradimensional friend?" She nodded at Helen.</p>\n<p>"Yeah. She's not doing so well, and my backup plan...well, that wasn't going to work either."</p>\n<p>"I have ideas...but I'm having trouble getting past the part where you're helping people." She shook her head. "Never understood what the Boss saw in you. Look, whatever is happening now, it's probably not permanent. If you really care about this girl\u2014which is again blowing my mind\u2014then you should prepare for crisis management when this wears off. Unless you want to send her back. You know <em>who</em> you have to ask for that."</p>\n<p>"I don't want to send her anywhere. She's in a bad spot, I want to see her through it. Isn't there a pill? A song I could sing? That's like our <em>bag</em>. You telling me we can't do anything with this crap?"</p>\n<p>Hypatia looked at her watch. "Not yet."</p>\n<p>"When?"</p>\n<p>"A couple of hours."</p>\n<p>"And then everything is going to be better?"</p>\n<p>"Remember who I work for. Nothing is ever going to stay the same. But how it goes is up to you. I'm not in charge of this trip."</p>\n<p>Charleston wandered backstage, muttering to himself, and stepped into Queenie's dressing room. She was taking off her makeup. Her wig hung on a nail beside the large illuminated mirror she was sitting in front of. "Can I help you?" she said.</p>\n<p>"You already have," enthused Charleston. "That was absolutely lovely, on a day when I needed to hear a song."</p>\n<p>"Yeah, lots of people needed to hear a song," said Queenie absently.</p>\n<p>"Is that a Kansas City sound I heard? Reminded me when I was a kid in the Twenties. Those were very special days to me. I met a lot of people who were important in my life while in jazz clubs. The music might be different, but I got the same feeling listening to you. Especially with everyone down in the dumps. I think you might be the only one singing in the entire city. If I may be so bold, how could others find inspiration?"</p>\n<p>"Everyone's inspiration is personal to them. Mine is...well, I ran away from home. So it's to keep running. And I like being around young people, play a lot of college towns."</p>\n<p>Charleston asked how long she had been in New Orleans. Not long, and probably not staying long either. She was supposed to sing tomorrow though, at the same place. Hypatia had been very good to her, had protected her.</p>\n<p>"From what you're running from? Forgive me, that was gauche. You ever record?"</p>\n<p>Her sound wasn't commercial enough to record, she said. "If you're trying to pick me up, it's probably not going to work."</p>\n<p>"I wasn't even thinking that way."</p>\n<p>"Generally men who come in my room talking about recording\u2014"</p>\n<p>"Just wanted to know if you had anything I could buy to listen to. I have a friend who is really down and I'm not sure how to give her back her inspiration."</p>\n<p>"She a runaway too? Yes? Probably you should just try to support her. Now if you don't mind, I need to change."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>At midnight, the party was barely limping along. Even with recorded music, most people weren't interested in dancing. If it wasn't for the orgy, it would have been a very boring party indeed. Bored and embarrassed, Temperance decided to accept Hypatia's offer to read her cards for her.</p>\n<p>Of course when Hypatia cut the deck, she showed the major Arcana card Temperance. This did not impress Miss Murphy, who knew how to stack a deck cold.</p>\n<p>"What do you want to know: what's gonna happen, who you are, or what you're gonna be?" said Hypatia, shuffling the cards rapidly.</p>\n<p>"Who I'll be," said Temperance lazily.</p>\n<p><em>[The possibilities were to gain a point of Cthulhu Mythos, rewrite one statement, or have a vision.]</em></p>\n<p>Nicole and Collette suddenly walked into the Caf\xe9. They were still wearing their Grecian dresses. Collette began to sing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strange is the night when the black stars rise</p>\nAnd strange moons circle in the skies<br/>But stranger still<br/>Is lost Carcosa...<br/></blockquote>\n<p>They were none of them exactly sure what happened next. Time passed. They danced. They all danced, with abandon, with joy, with ecstasy. Outside bands wandered the street, playing music, followed by long lines of singing and swaying people.</p>\n<p>Candace came to her senses first. She felt flooded with inspiration and ran out the door, racing for the townhouse and the typewriter.</p>\n<p>Jimmy paused in mid-step. He was standing on the bar next to Beth. "I don't know how to shuffle off to Buffalo," he muttered. He leapt down gracefully and helped her to the floor.</p>\n<p>"Were we just doing something from a Gene Kelly flick?" she said. Jimmy shrugged.</p>\n<p>Charleston was dancing with Helen, doing, of course, the Charleston. He thought he had left her back at Isabelle's. "How are you feeling?" he asked.</p>\n<p>"Great. I wrote a poem. I wrote three poems, actually. Wait a minute. Four. I wrote one on your back."</p>\n<p>"I was wondering why I wasn't wearing a shirt or pants."</p>\n<p>"Maybe we should not let that go to waste," she leered.</p>\n<p><em>Crisis management</em>, thought Charleston.</p>\n<p><em>[So everyone with any points in Art suddenly got a bonus pool that refilled daily...but they also had a strong urge to make art immediately and constantly...]</em></p>\n<p>Temperance flagged down a barmaid, who was humming loudly to herself. "Where did Nicole and Collette go?" she asked her.</p>\n<p>"Hrm," she said. "They're not backstage...wait, I know! I think they left when that impromptu parade started. Or maybe they began it. Anyway, I've been singing all night."</p>\n<p>"That's great." She raced over to Hypatia. "You see Nicole and Collette\u2014"</p>\n<p>"Yes. And since you're going to ask, I don't know where they went. Down Bourbon Street, followed by a lot of people. You all right? Your pencil hand keeps twitching."</p>\n<p>"Yes, yes it does." She tried to push the urge to draw out of her head. She sped away to Jimmy. "Mr. Wright!"</p>\n<p>"Hello, Temperance."</p>\n<p>"I have a job for you. Follow the crowd. Find the girls. Keep Sam away from them, he wants to put them in a cage. Something involving chicken wire."</p>\n<p>"A Faraday cage?"</p>\n<p>"Whatever. I have something important to do." She turned and practically skipped out the door.</p>\n<p>When she got back to the townhouse, she found Van playing remarkably beautiful music on the piano in the parlor. She sat down on the couch with her sketchbook, drawing while he played.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 7)</b>\n<p>If the previous day had been one of a dolorous lack of joy in New Orleans, today was the day when there were literally people singing on the street. Candace and Helen were both busy at their typewriters; neither had stopped since they had come home, and neither came down to have breakfast with Jimmy and Isabelle.</p>\n<p>"I tried to get Van to stop playing. He threatened me. With a knife," sighed Isabelle. "I took it from him, but maybe it's best to let him play. And Temperance will need a new sketchbook soon. If you want to talk to Etienne, I spoke to him and he'd be happy to meet you."</p>\n<p>"I would definitely like that," said Jimmy. "I'll take Sam and Charleston. They seem the least affected."</p>\n<p>Isabelle shook her head. "Who would have thought?"</p>\n<p>Etienne Laurent de Marigny lived not far away in the Quarter. They walked over, and let the aged African-American butler take their coats. He led them into a drawing room that was wall to wall bookshelves, stuffed with obscure items, charts, vials, bottled specimens, and a hundred other things they couldn't recognize.</p>\n<p>Etienne was sitting behind a desk covered with high stacks of paper. He was somewhere in his seventies, an elegant white-haired man, portly, with sweeping mustaches in the French style. "Mr. Wright, please forgive me for not having introduced myself earlier," he said. "I believe we are both in a similar field. I am aware of many of your accomplishments. Dr. Acererak, I am familiar with your questing. My son and his friend Titus are more in that line. I wish you well. A friend of mine attempted to get into that realm. Perhaps you know him: Randolph Carter?"</p>\n<p>"Honored, I think," said Sam.</p>\n<p>"Mr. Chiu," continued de Marigny. He paused. "The less said the better."</p>\n<p>"I feel people treat me as a lot less approachable than I am," groused Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Your reputation from the Twenties and Thirties does tend to prejudice people, I think."</p>\n<p>"There certainly was less prejudice back then."</p>\n<p>"Touch\xe9. So, gentlemen, you have been in touch with my friend Carl Simon. And I have corresponded with Mr. Bacon in San Francisco, although my letters are being returned now. Probably for the best. Mr. Bacon is closer to what people think Mr. Chiu is like than Mr. Chiu. He was interested in the King in Yellow\u2014not just the play, but other manifestations of that entity..."</p>\n<p>"Such as?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"If one were to consult the Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan (of which I happen to be a translator) one would find many references to the Yellow Emperor of Chinese legend, enough that the King and Emperor may be the same. Certainly history shows the rising and falling influence of Aldebaran on the affairs of this planet."</p>\n<p>"We managed to stop a ritual about that," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"You are to be commended. The release of Hastur upon this world...well, I shudder to think about the effects it might have on our society. We already teeter on the edge of paranoia; the influence of the King tends to push things in that direction."</p>\n<p>"Is what's happening now part of that influence?"</p>\n<p>"I'm not sure. I think our young ladies may have made an...error. We may reliably conjecture that they dabbled with Yellow."</p>\n<p>"So did every artist in this city," said Sam.</p>\n<p>"It has a potent effect on the artistic. It allows the spirit to wander."</p>\n<p>"But how is it that these ladies were able to experience this phenomenon when everyone else is bereft of inspiration?"</p>\n<p>"We are under the influence of Aldebaran. My friend Carl has his own theories...but for our purposes, I propose that if one's spirit wanders under such circumstances, it runs the risk of being forced into the pattern. The pattern of the play."</p>\n<p>"So they have entered Carcosa?"</p>\n<p>"They may be re-enacting roles. There are always two ladies. There is always the King. And always a Stranger. However, I think there may have been a stronger influence here: some personage that might be closely connected to Carcosa?"</p>\n<p>"I know that some people in this room have been there," said Sam. Etienne paled visibly.</p>\n<p>"I was doing my best to avoid saying anything about that," growled Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't get the memo."</p>\n<p>"Would you be interested in seeing an artifact of Carcosa?" said Charleston. He held out the mask, Noor's mask, that he had taken from the city.</p>\n<p>"I don't know what that is," said Etienne, puzzled. "It doesn't look like anything to me."</p>\n<p><em>[Fine, fine, I stole it from </em>Westworld<em>. But it's a good line.]</em></p>\n<p>"Part of its charm, I suppose," said Charleston suspiciously.</p>\n<p>"Well. You escaped from Carcosa, you say? Did you bring anyone with you?"</p>\n<p>"Of course not," said Charleston quickly.</p>\n<p>"Well. There may still be Carcosans on Earth. I have my own agents looking into that," said Etienne, patting a thick envelope, "when I have more answers I will let you know."</p>\n<p>"The King is the ruler of Carcosa?" said Sam.</p>\n<p>"That question is somewhat complicated."</p>\n<p>"But the person who creates Carcosa controls it. So maybe if we could make Carcosa, we could become the King."</p>\n<p>"You cannot become the King. He is not human. He is beyond human comprehension. The form we see him in is only the way our poor minds grasp him. You don't <em>create</em> Carcosa, sir. You can make it appear in your own image, but it is still Carcosa. It will still always be the same day."</p>\n<p>"We should stop talking about making it," said Jimmy. "We should be trying to reduce its influence on us."</p>\n<p>"But this is the time when we could become so much more! Why should we limit ourselves? Once we understand this, we could become\u2014"</p>\n<p><em>[TP: I want to thank you for being a Resident Evil villain.]</em></p>\n<p>"Gentlemen, I have my agents working on this problem," said Etienne, standing up and gently pushing them toward the door. Jimmy noticed he had a letter lying on the desk that was signed, unbelievably enough, <em>Millicent Lowell</em>. "There are many influences in New Orleans, from long before any white man saw this land. I think the ladies may have found a way to tap them. I would expect some incident at Mrs. O'Donnell's ball tonight."</p>\n<p><em>[Millicent was a PC in my run of </em>Eternal Lies<em>, which also included Jimmy of course.]</em></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464256/#Comment_464256" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-23T18:34:27+00:00" title="June 23, 2017  6:34PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 8)</b>\n<p>Temperance was curled up on the davenport, still sketching, when Van abruptly stopped playing piano. "I don't wanna stop," he mused, "but my hands can't take it anymore. Your hands look kinda clenched, I knew a cat like that. Drummer, his wrists got so bad he couldn't play. Anyway, I just did the entire <em>Well Tempered Clavier</em> and I'm out of ideas."</p>\n<p>"Yes," said Temperance, looking at her hands. "I ran out of ink a while ago, the only pen I have is this one Candace gave me."</p>\n<p>"That pen doesn't write, man."</p>\n<p>"Invisible ink."</p>\n<p>"Wow. That's brilliant, man. How would that work? Would the audience have some way of making it appear? That's <em>ephemeral</em>."</p>\n<p>"You can use black light on it. She gave it to me to write secrets in. But I don't have any."</p>\n<p>"Everyone's got some secrets."</p>\n<p>"You want to hear my life story?"</p>\n<p>"I'd love to hear it. Lay it on me."</p>\n<p>"Here's the pamphlet: left in an orphanage when I was little, my pa got me when I was 5, he kept up my education and the church. Most of my time has been spent with nuns or him. I like baseball and comic books, got educated a little in Europe, and through the Carlyles\u2014family friends\u2014I met the infamous Jimmy Wright."</p>\n<p>"Oh man, you should see the files my father keeps on that cat. I only read one, it was about an inch thick and labeled <em>1929-1930</em>." He closed the piano lid and sat down on the couch next to her. "You probably know my story: born in California, my mom wanted to name me after my crazy dead uncle..."</p>\n<p>"Really?"</p>\n<p>"You never heard the story of Roger Vane Carlyle the First? Well. My family is very rich, armaments and chemicals. My grandparents died in a car accident, and even though Mom was the older sibling, times being what they was it all went to her brother Roger. Now, he was many things, including not very likely to produce an heir if you understand me. But he was not a good businessman. What he liked to do instead of that\u2014and maybe this is how I really am like him\u2014is run around to jazz clubs and bars, drinking and having a good time. He was just a kid, and running the company into the ground. Then he took up with some crazy people and got those heebie-jeebie visions. Next thing people know, he's lighting out for Egypt to be an archaeologist, like that cat Carter, him and all these crazies, Penhew, some kinda British noble, this cat Jack Brady, an ex-marine my uncle was <em>close</em> to, and this chick Hypatia. She was his beard, I think. So they go to Egypt and then Africa and they got themselves killed there."</p>\n<p>"Hypatia?" said Temperance sharply.</p>\n<p>"Yeah, Hypatia Masters. Anyway, that's the story of how my uncle went off his rocker and got eaten by wild animals."</p>\n<p><em>[That's the backstory, of course, for </em>Masks of Nyarlathotep<em>, with my own additions to the corpus (mostly the relationship between Roger and Jack, and Erica being cheated of her inheritance.) Fortunately Temperance doesn't know who "Vanessa Brady" is in our continuity...]</em></p>\n<p>"Actually, I can identify with parts of that..."</p>\n<p>"I met your mom. She's a little..."</p>\n<p>"Off her nutter."</p>\n<p>"Yeah. I sometimes worry I got a little more of my uncle in me than I think. I had a breakdown while I was in conservatory. After I got better I just ran off to Europe. Played a lot of gigs in Europe. Good training."</p>\n<p>"Maybe I should do something like that. Let my hair down."</p>\n<p>"Can you sing?"</p>\n<p>"Hymns. My father once said, Temperance, you're a great many things, but when it comes to singing you sound like a cat caught in a garbage compactor."</p>\n<p>"Well that don't seem fair. If you can sing, we could put you in the band."</p>\n<p>"I hear what the guys call me behind my back." She made a square shape with her hands.</p>\n<p>"You're not that square. Not with your mom for family."</p>\n<p>"I have my moments. I mean, I could fleece you all at cards if I wanted."</p>\n<p>"Hold it a moment," he said, and got up and dashed upstairs. He came back holding an album, an old 78. "This is Duke Ellington," he said. "Listen to a little of this. It will...wait what am I doing."</p>\n<p>He sat back down at the piano and played "Sophisticated Lady" to an entranced Temperance.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>It happened while Candace was typing, that feeling that some presence was gathering in her room: that feeling that someone was standing <em>right behind her</em>, like when she had been writing too long and Andy would come up behind her and put his hands on her shoulders. So close. So close, almost touching.</p>\n<p>Like always, her writing became much better during these events.</p>\n<p>Eventually it faded. She stretched and felt her stomach groan. She was out of cigarettes. She was almost out of <em>Yellow</em>. She took the last hit of it she had.</p>\n<p>She felt a hand run up and down her back.</p>\n<p>She turned back to her novel. It was an epic story in a modern setting, an autobiographical story of a woman coming into herself. She bent over the keyboard in a frenzy and hammered out the best sex scene she had ever written. At least Beth was impressed when she showed it to her.</p>\n<p>"That's..." she stammered, as her glasses fogged. "That's really...wow. You have to tell me who taught you that...so I can meet him."</p>\n<p>Candace grinned. "It's been like five years," muttered Beth to herself, reflecting on how long she had been separated from Percy. "And not like there's any likely candidates in the current crew. Well, maybe one, but I have a thing for older men."</p>\n<p>"I'm sure Neal and Jack would love to meet you."</p>\n<p>"I thought Neal was..."</p>\n<p>"That doesn't hold him back."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464327/#Comment_464327" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T17:02:58+00:00" title="June 26, 2017  5:02PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 9)</b>\n<p>The <em>Bal des Mortes </em>was a staid affair, black tie for the men, evening gowns for the ladies. As the guests filed in, Rudy and Charlie confronted Temperance. "We've been in the city for like a week and we haven't seen anything," said Charlie.</p>\n<p>"You've been to the balls..."</p>\n<p>"They're all <em>weirdos</em>. It's New Orleans. We want New Orleans weird. No more boring old people music. Some Bill Haley or good R&amp;B?"</p>\n<p>"Who's Bill Haley?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"That cat can't play for shit," said Van. Mencius, warming up his bass, just looked over and nodded. "True."</p>\n<p>"Are there going to be any young people around here," said Rudy, "or are we stuck with <em>you</em>?"</p>\n<p>"I will take you out on the town tomorrow. No, not to a museum. NO, you may ABSOLUTELY not go with Sam."</p>\n<p>Candace came down in a gorgeous purple gown. "Jesus Mary and Joseph," said Seamus. "That would make a bishop kick through a stained glass window." His wife smacked him.</p>\n<p>Most of the evening was taken up with a rather boring meeting where Isabelle and the other principals worked out their fundraising goals for the next year, where they would donate their charitable givings, and where they wanted to do the balls next year. Helen, lounging near Charleston, stifled a yawn. "Whoever knew monsters could be so dull?" she said.</p>\n<p>Candace found herself near the bar next to an elegantly-dressed older woman who had bronzed , Mediterranean good looks. She gave Candace a once over and said, "Dior?"</p>\n<p>"Givenchy."</p>\n<p>"Aren't we fancy. Haven't seen you here before. Yolanda Giacoma."</p>\n<p>"Candace Heartbrooke."</p>\n<p>"Are you moving here?"</p>\n<p>"I don't plan to put down roots anywhere."</p>\n<p>"Oh, one of those jazz people. Jazz used to be so much more interesting when I was younger, in the 1920s. Who are those charming children?" she asked, pointing to Rudy and Charlie, who were in the middle of a fight. As usual.</p>\n<p>Candace glanced around for Temperance. "Not really my responsibility."</p>\n<p>"I think I will go make their acquaintance."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance was getting a cup of punch. She turned around and almost bumped into a red-headed woman in a white dress. "Pray forgive me," she said.</p>\n<p>"Think nothing of it," said Edie Montague.</p>\n<p>Temperance gaped for rather longer than would be considered ladylike. "What brings you here," she finally said.</p>\n<p>"It's a party, innit?" She gave a wolfish grin. "Where else would I be?"</p>\n<p>"Why are you here?"</p>\n<p>"I'm single, in a strange city. These people are accepting I here, especially yon revenant lady running things." She nodded at Isabelle. "Would ye care to have a Sco\u2014a cuppa tea with me?"</p>\n<p>"I'll have Scotch with you."</p>\n<p>"Yer health then," said Edie as they sat at a small table. "Don't be alarmed lassie. I don't bear ye any ill will. Why would I? I weren't in my right head back when I saw you last. I took off my mask, d'ye see? Of course, I put it back on tonight, for appearances sake."</p>\n<p>"What have you been doing?"</p>\n<p>"Errands. Verra busy. In fact I must be goin'. But we'll see each other soon."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy and Beth were looking around for Rudy and Charlie. "I don't see why we have to chaperone," grumbled Beth. "I don't even <em>like</em> children. You think I wanted to have children with Percy? They'd have come out all weird, with tails or something."</p>\n<p>Jimmy grunted. "Why should we bother?" continued Beth. "Mr. Wright, do you know the foxtrot?"</p>\n<p>"Now is not the time for the foxtrot!" panted Temperance, running up.</p>\n<p>"When is it <em>ever</em> the right time?"</p>\n<p>"What's wrong?" said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"She's here. Edie. And she's being creepily polite and cryptic."</p>\n<p>"That's never good. Where's my sword?"</p>\n<p>Sam was trying to spike the punch when he noticed several people coming into the townhouse. They were elegantly dressed, although the style was a bit out of date. Not that it meant much; he suspected there was a reason some of the guests had asked Van to play music from the 18th century: probably revisiting the hits of their youth. Still, he ambled over to Jimmy, Beth and Temperance. "We may have a problem."</p>\n<p>And at that moment Terpsichore and Euterpe showed up. I mean, of course, Nicole and Collette.</p>\n<p>Jimmy found himself foxtrotting with Beth. In the corner Van was pounding out some new theme with countless variations. People were singing and dancing all around him, all but a knot of men in tails and women dressed as flappers. And they were closing in on Rudy and Charlie.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464370/#Comment_464370" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T14:54:17+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  2:54PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 10)</b>\n<p>Yolanda grabbed Nicole and Collette and pushed them toward the door. All four of the strange men in tails surrounded Rudy and Charlie; their three flapper companions began moving toward Temperance and Jimmy.</p>\n<p><em>[Sense Trouble checks here to act for J &amp; T.]</em></p>\n<p>As Temperance tried to jog up, two of the girls slashed at her with claws that burst from their fingertips. Her dress was slashed to ribbons and she fell back.</p>\n<p><em>[10 points of damage here.]</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy fished into the piano and pulled out his sword and a pistol. "That's why that B was flat?" said Van, without missing a note. Jimmy tossed Temperance the pistol and ran for the door, trying to cut off the kidnappers. He slid in front of them, drawing the sword, and slashing one of the men.</p>\n<p><em>[Preparedness by JP to have this stuff in position, then Athletics; the Athletics roll netted an extra benefit, which was to take an attack, and THAT netted an extra benefit, Terrible Harm in this case.]</em></p>\n<p>He had just time to note that the wounds weren't bleeding much when Yolanda seized his wrist. "Mr. Wright, you don't want to get in our way. Oh BOYS!" she shouted.</p>\n<p>From the street, Jimmy heard a sound he hadn't heard for quite a while\u2014but you never forget the deep-throated bark of a Thompson submachine gun. He slammed to the deck as bullets shattered the front windows. Glass fragments flew through the air. The other people in the room were screaming, in perfect harmony as it happens. A couple of bullets struck some of Yolanda's party boys, but they didn't slow down as they dragged the kids outside.</p>\n<p>Temperance slid into a slight crouch, the shooter's stance her stepfather preferred, and fired off several rounds. The good-time girls took the bullets and slid back toward the door. Right into Jimmy's sword. He damn near cut one of their feet off.</p>\n<p><em>[Shooting test got TP a benefit, which was Suppress.]</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy pushed out the door behind the girls. He saw two men standing on the running board of an old Packard, holding Thompsons. They fired off some bursts as the car sped away. He picked himself up and came back inside.</p>\n<p>"In my house!," Isabelle was ranting. "That <em>bitch</em>. Yolanda Giacona! Her father Iggy was a mobster back in the Twenties and Thirties. He and his son died rather mysteriously in 1937 and she took over the Family."</p>\n<p>"Does anyone in our circle die normally?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Yes...well, sometimes. But it doesn't always stick," said Isabelle. "They were more than mobsters. They were cultists of a certain god. Haven't heard anything from that particular group in almost twenty years, though."</p>\n<p>"Where's Francis' armory?" said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"What makes you think Francis would have a...oh, all right. It's not here in the house, but I'll get the key. We have some time, if they kidnapped them they want them for something. I can't help but notice they took them the night before the <em>Bal des Monstres</em> and the end of the year...and that they took Nicole and Collette."</p>\n<p>"Maybe they were trying to meet a quota before the New Year," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Sometimes I think I have missed you. Then you say things like that and I stop."</p>\n<p>"When I cut them they barely bled," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"That is entertainingly interesting. And they had claws."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Francis' armory was in a stoutly locked cinderblock shed just outside the city. Isabelle had to do a long series of checks to make sure she had disabled all the traps. "Help yourself," she said, waving around.</p>\n<p>"Where did you get this?" said Sam, grabbing an automatic weapon from the wall.</p>\n<p>"Oh, the Russian weapon? Somewhere on the Soviet border, I think." Sam cradled the AK-47 to his chest. Jimmy shrugged and selected a shotgun and some other small arms.</p>\n<p>"Hey Jimmy, try this on," said Charleston. He handed him a bulletproof vest.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Candace talked to Isabelle's friends, especially the ones who spanned both the occult and criminal worlds. She found out the Giaconas had been part of a cult that had a reputation for being somewhat...dark and twisted. They had a fearsome reputation, but in the last couple of decades the Giaconas had lost their grip of terror on the underworld and were actually in decline.</p>\n<p>She took Beth with her to help do interviews; her anthropological training could fill in the gaps of her own knowledge. They trolled some waterfront bars for a while. Yolanda had managed to ably run the family since her death of her brother and father. They found out something else interesting: back in the Twenties, the Giaconas had owned a paddlewheel steamer that they kept on Lake Pontchartrain. They only took special guests there...and sometimes they didn't come back.</p>\n<p><em>[Beth gives the Investigators a 2-point Interpersonal pool because of her field training. This was mostly Oral History and High Society.]</em></p>\n<p>When they got back they found the boys and Temperance loading weapons. "Mr. Wright, were you ever in the army?" said Beth, taken aback, when she saw Jimmy cleaning his shotgun and laying out his armor.</p>\n<p>"Something like that. You should stay here with Isabelle."</p>\n<p>A little while later they drove up to the Lake. Francis kept a boat there for fishing. Unsurprisingly, it had a sonar set in it, along with a note from Francis telling Jimmy to not touch his stuff. The pilot Isabelle had arranged waited until they were all onboard and then cast off.</p>\n<p>"Guy Rondeau," he said by way of introduction. He swung them into a search pattern over the fog-shrouded water.</p>\n<p><em>[It turns out nobody had Pilot.</em></p>\n<p><em>TP: Couldn't Isabelle hire someone?</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: Sure.</em></p>\n<p><em>TP: Some rando guy.</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: It's pronounced "Guy Rondeau" and he's Cajun.]</em></p>\n<p>After a couple of hours, they finally got a sonar echo that looked likely. They approached carefully, and had Guy cut the engine as they came within rifleshot.</p>\n<p>"Gonna be guys with guns for sure," muttered Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Actually, not," said Charleston, keeping a weather eye. They glided up along the paddlewheeler and jumped to the deck.</p>\n<p>"Here's why," said Jimmy, pointing to the bodies of some Giacona soldiers. They had all had their necks cleanly slit by a very sharp blade.</p>\n<p>"Edie," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"This is pretty recent," said Charleston. "Within the last couple of hours."</p>\n<p><em>[Me: You don't have Medical, so you're not sure how long...</em></p>\n<p><em>CP: I base it on my years of experience as a murderer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: Fair enough.]</em></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464400/#Comment_464400" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-28T15:22:13+00:00" title="June 28, 2017  3:22PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 11)</b>\n<p>Temperance made her way down the promenade deck. She found a large room that was padded and had many restraints along the walls and on tables. She spun around at the sound of something rustling.</p>\n<p>She turned around. A small figure was toddling out of the shadows. It was a baby.</p>\n<p>With no eyes. Not even sockets.</p>\n<p>She screamed. The baby opened its mouth. It was filled with sharp teeth. As it raised its hands, she saw strange scars on the palms...they looked almost like little mouths with teeth...but they were healing over, like they were wounds of some kind.</p>\n<p>She kicked it against the wall like she was making a field goal. It smashed apart, and slid down in a slimy, bloody mess just as the rest of them came up. They stalked down the stairs to the lower deck.</p>\n<p>At the foot of the stairs, they saw more of the "babies" come running up, six of them. Jimmy backhanded one with the sword, but it ducked under the blade. Two of them bit savagely into his ankles, drawing blood.</p>\n<p>The rest of the, well, <em>demonic children</em> were crawling toward the stairs. Temperance reared back and kicked the head off of one them, but missed her second kick. Candace retreated back a few steps. Charleston was trying to push past her when Sam stepped up.</p>\n<p>He thumbed the fire selector on his AK-47 to "Full Auto" and sprayed the hallway with gunfire until the magazine ran out. Ricochets whinged around; splinters of wood flew back at them. Even with the cordite rounds the assault rifle used, the hallway was filled with thin, acrid smoke.</p>\n<p>Jimmy swept up the two <em>things</em> clutching on his ankle and bashed their heads against the wall, killing them.</p>\n<p>They filed down the companionway. They saw the remains of the Party Boys and Good Time girls in one stateroom; they were riddled with Sam's bullets, but looked like they had been rotting away even before he fired. They found another staircase leading down and followed it to a large stateroom below the waterline.</p>\n<p>This was a plush room\u2014literally, given the extensive velvet coverings. A brick wall had been inset into one of the bulkheads; chained up to it were Rudy and Charlie, both gagged. Standing near a sumptuously upholstered banquette was Yolanda Giaconda, wearing an opulent red velvet gown with a cape that swept over her shoulders and ran down onto the floor for quite some distance behind her.</p>\n<p>Temperance noticed, however, that despite her normal <em>dans un certain age</em> appearance, Yolanda seemed wan, drawn, and tired. She also noticed that something seemed to be <em>moving</em> under her dress.</p>\n<p><em>[1-point Notice spend.]</em></p>\n<p>"You're here for the children," said Yolanda without preamble. "Of course. You have to understand, the family religion\u2014when the Mouths started talking again...I had to make a <em>try</em>, didn't I? But it turns out we were just actors in a play. The wrong play. I took your siblings because the God was very well acquainted with your mother..."</p>\n<p>Temperance realized with a sharp shock that Yolanda kept wiping her mouth because when she didn't, it <em>seemed to heal shut</em>...she fired off a couple of quick rounds, striking her center mass. She slowly walked over to where Yolanda had fallen upon the floor.</p>\n<p>Jimmy watched intently. He hadn't liked the drift of this conversation at all...</p>\n<p>Temperance bent down. Yolanda was bleeding out, but she already seemed sapped, drained of vitality. Her mouth continued to film over as she gasped out her final words. "No more...lies. I wasted too much time...on the dead! Listen! The exile does not wish you harm...but...she is caught in...a...trap...and wishes you to take...hr...plce..."</p>\n<p>Her mouth was sealed shut, covered over with skin as if it had never been open. Charleston was swinging around behind her to shoot her if, as so often was the case, the sorcerer's first death wasn\u2019t permanent. He saw something crawl out from under Yolanda's dress.</p>\n<p>In a lifetime spent walking the boundaries of the strange, few things after his first horrific encounters were capable of startling him; but this...this...</p>\n<p>It was long and tubular, like some great pallid worm dug up from the Stygian depths of the sea. On the ventral side was a mouth, a horrid lipless thing like a slash across flesh, with snaggled and broken teeth jutting out at all angles. A black and forked tongue flashed out almost lasciviously, and a honey-colored slime drooled out from the edges of the mouth. It muttered in a wordless ululating language. But perhaps the true horror was that this <em>thing</em> the Mouth grew on had been a human arm once; withered and wasted, but clearly a woman's arm. It seemed to have lost all its bones and it writhed sickeningly as it inched across the floor, pulling itself with boneless fingers.</p>\n<p><em>[4 point Stability loss for Chuckles here.]</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy ran to the kids. "Uncle Jimmy, we've seen some <em>things</em>," moaned Rudy.</p>\n<p>"Close your eyes," he said. He strode over to the arm. The Mouth hissed at him as he unsheathed his sword. He raised it slowly, then lowered it, sighting along the blade. The Mouth chuckled evilly; it clearly recognized him. Then he slammed the blade into it, with such force that he felt the blade bite clean through the hull. The orange slime sprayed everywhere. He felt dizzy. For a moment, he saw vast ranks of himself arrayed on either side, like an infinity mirror; then it faded and he felt cold water pooling around his feet. He paid it no mind and helped Temperance take the kids out of the room.</p>\n<p>Had he been paying closer attention, he might have noticed that some of the slime had soaked his pants leg. And was rubbing up against the open wounds on his ankle.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>They pulled away from the paddlewheeler. Somebody had come on the boat and killed everyone, Rudy stammered out. Someone wearing a white mask. Whoever they were, they had taken the Muses with them. Charlie, who had kept a clearer head, told them some of what she had overheard from Yolanda: how her cult had stolen the Last Mouth from some facility out west; how suddenly two days ago it had started to talk again; that Yolanda had kidnapped them because of "something in their blood."</p>\n<p>"I'm going to take care of all this," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"They thought they were going to the ball tonight," said Rudy. "The Muses."</p>\n<p>"That's our next stop. We'll handle this."</p>\n<p>"I'd be more confident since Mr. Wright is here, but he's scaring me right now," said Charlie.</p>\n<p>"He's just seasick," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Seasick makes you murderous?"</p>\n<p>"Now you'll know to never get seasick."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464458/#Comment_464458" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T17:58:54+00:00" title="June 29, 2017  5:58PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 12)</b>\n<p>They dropped the children off at Isabelle's house. Seamus and Sean were there to watch over things. "Don't worry, things may get a bit <em>hairy</em>," said Sean, winking at Jimmy. "But we'll watch over the bairns."</p>\n<p>They moved on to the <em>Bal des Monstres</em>, at the recently-refurbished Hotel Palais Royal\u2014no expense had been spared to make it look 200 years old. The Ball itself was in the parqueted main ballroom, a room dizzy with mirrors that would not have looked out of place in Versailles. This Ball, the last of the occult balls, was the only one attended by the non-occult denizens of the city; several notable local politicos were there, mixing it up on the dance floor in a fine New Orleans style.</p>\n<p>As they entered, they could see Nicole and Collette standing as still as caryatid columns next to a gilded throne; it was the custom of the Ball to elect a King of the Revels at the end of the night. Candace pulled down her mask, the one she had been given in Carcosa; Jimmy pushed his shotgun a little higher on its sling.</p>\n<p>They fanned out into the crowd; around them swirled the masked revelers. Suddenly Candace saw Edie\u2014she wasn't sure how it was that she got there, or how it was that she knew it was Edie\u2014striding through the room, wearing white robes. Her mask was a smooth, almost featureless porcelain affair that covered her whole face with just slits for the eyes and mouth.</p>\n<p>"Hello, Candace," the...Stranger...said.</p>\n<p>"Hello...Edie?"</p>\n<p>"Not really. I took off my mask for the Ball. What do you intend to do, Candace? Which Court do you belong to?"</p>\n<p>"Whichever one suits me best," said Candace. She didn't see any change on the mask, but she felt Edie was smiling.</p>\n<p>"Verra good. You will help me? I wish no harm to these girls. But it is almost time for them to unmask."</p>\n<p>"What help do you need?"</p>\n<p>"Just stand at my side." She stroked Candace's face. For a moment, she felt that same shiver of feeling she had felt earlier, when she had been touched by the Presence that invaded her writing.</p>\n<p>Edie turned and moved through the crowd. Someone tried to grab her, but he pulled back his hand as if burned. Temperance could see blood spurting from his eyes. Midnight began to strike. The crowd began to remove their masks, even including Nicole and Collette. Edie hopped up on the stage and stood next to the throne.</p>\n<p>Nicole turned to her with blank eyes. She said in a monotone, "You should unmask."</p>\n<p>"Indeed?" said Edie.</p>\n<p>"Yes, we have all laid aside disguise but you," said Collette in the same monotone.</p>\n<p>"I wear no mask," said Edie. She sat down on the throne, crossed one leg over the other, and relaxed back into the chair. "Don't be afraid. We come as viceroy, not as King."</p>\n<p>"Welcome, viceroy," said Charleston with a tone just above a sneer.</p>\n<p>"It is not for you to welcome Us, nor to hinder the coming and going of the King. For His time will come when it is His time to come. And you cannot change that."</p>\n<p>"When is he coming?" said Sam.</p>\n<p>"First let us discuss the matter of the Exile. Where is she, you ask? That is an interesting question. But since <em>you</em> are responsible for her escape, <em>you</em> shall be responsible for her return. For that is Our Royal Will."</p>\n<p>"Capture a person from Carcosa? Sounds intriguing," said Sam.</p>\n<p>"It is an affair of your mortal world, and you will settle it. Or we will settle it for you. Deliver her to Us, or We will not be merciful." Nicole and Collette began to bleed from the eyes. "Shall We not hold them hostage for the vouchsafing?"</p>\n<p>Temperance and Jimmy glared at Edie. At the Stranger.</p>\n<p>"We can afford to be merciful," said the Stranger. And then she made the Yellow Sign.</p>\n<p>She made it in the air, moving her fist rapidly, leaving a glowing sickly yellow afterimage that hung there horrifically, burning and beating even against closed eyes. People shrieked in the crowd, or broke down weeping, all but Jimmy, Charleston, Temperance and Candace, the veterans of Carcosa.</p>\n<p>The room went black for a moment. When the emergency lights came back on, they saw the two girls, the former Muses, collapsed on the stage, but breathing gently, caught in a deep sleep.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464497/#Comment_464497" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-30T15:08:08+00:00" title="June 30, 2017  3:08PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: A Singer Must Die (Part 13)</b>\n<p>There were some loose ends to tie up:</p>\n<p>Charleston concluded that the girls, by trying to connect the <em>loas</em> to the ancient Greek muses, had accidentally tied themselves into the ascendant power of the King in Yellow. Which might have happened no matter what, but with Aldebaran's influence growing, it was an unfortunate mistake. They had been caught up into the Play, the only play, taking on the roles of Camilla and Cassilda. He speculated that the temporal distortions that seemed to accompany anything to do with Carcosa had allowed the brief revival of the god Jimmy would only call the Liar.</p>\n<p>The girls only had dim, dreamlike memories of wandering the dark streets of an endless city that seemed like New Orleans except older and vaster, and with two suns that were constantly setting into a vast lake they guessed was and was not Lake Pontchartrain. They were stalked by some figure they never caught sight of but was always there; the soft hiss of his silken robes haunted them and they were incredibly jumpy around everyone.

Using his skills after a lifetime of dodging the law, Charleston managed to talk his way past the cops to look in on the study. He found a picture of a jazz singer from the 1930s, in front of a Kansas City nightclub called the Dapper and Brown. The singer's name was Cassandra Lezhone; Etienne had circled her face and written, in French: <em>Les yeux! On peut y toujours voir la verit\xe9, m\xeame si toutes des autres caract\xe9ristiques de son visage ont chang\xe9. </em></p>\n<p><em>[In English: The eyes! We can always see the truth there, even if all the other features of her face have changed.]</em></p>\n<p>There was also a record of Etienne's trying to call someone named Millicent Lowell with no success; there was a letter from her that he showed Jimmy later. It naturally caused him much concern:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Mr. de Marigny,</p>\n\xa0<br/>After sending you my last letter, I made some further inquiries at Miskatonic University. I have been able to find out a few things thanks to our friends there.<br/>\xa0<br/>First, the woman you asked about seems to have been in the city more than once in the last 15 years although not matching the description you gave me. From what you have said, I expected as much.<br/>\xa0<br/>Second, the box was definitely brought back to Miskatonic University sometime in 1939 or 1940. I am trying to get access to the Orne Library, but since Professor Armitage\u2019s death it is harder to visit the special collections.<br/>\xa0<br/>Third, I have found some very interesting phenomena in this building. I don\u2019t want to say more until all the evidence is in (as a good friend taught me when I was younger) but I have taken a room here to try and observe them first hand. I am not sure but I was able to determine that Miss C lived here at least twice in the last twenty years.<br/>\xa0<br/>I look forward to writing to you soon with what I have uncovered. As always, if anything should happen to me please forward the sealed letters I gave you to their addressees.<br/>\xa0<br/>\xa0<br/>Your friend,<br/>\xa0<br/>\xa0<br/>\xa0<br/>Millicent Lowell<br/></blockquote>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"How do you handle these things?" Rudy asked Temperance when they were alone.</p>\n<p>"I have my faith, and I have my training. I've been doing this for a while, and there's someone very special who is helping me."</p>\n<p>"Should I talk to the Colonel? Dad never teaches me about fighting, he just wants me to study engineering."</p>\n<p>"Talking to my father is probably not a good idea," she said with a wince. "Geronimo is a good man. But you should go far away from this."</p>\n<p>"I'm going to go to college and be good. Maybe be a doctor like Dad wants."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy found Charlie waiting for him late one night when he went down to the kitchen for a drink.</p>\n<p>"Okay, spill," she said. "<em>James.</em>"</p>\n<p>She said it just like her mother. Before he could make that observation, she soldiered on, just like her mother:</p>\n<p>"Don't pretend I haven't heard Mom talk about you. She didn't lose her arm in a car accident, did she?"</p>\n<p>"No. She meddled in something I told her not to meddle with, and lost her arm in the process."</p>\n<p>"Can I help?"</p>\n<p>"No. Go back and leave this alone."</p>\n<p>"But I <em>can</em> help. You're bringing Beth, and she's an old lady."</p>\n<p>Jimmy shook his head. "Go home before you end up like your mother."</p>\n<p>"A famous adventuress?"</p>\n<p>"Go home. Go home before you become like that lady on the boat. Before you become a corpse."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>For Candace, the whole thing just spurred her onto even more and better writing; but then again, just about <em>anything</em> did that for her nowadays. Sometimes she took walks for relaxation and inspiration. Around town, she saw the graffiti:</p>\n<p><em>Il arrive qu'il arrive.</em></p>\n<p><em>The King! (or Le Roi)</em></p>\n<p><em>The world will have a new spirit, the Stranger says</em></p>\n<p>And a few times, twisting in the shadows, the Yellow Sign. Those walks always refreshed her; and after them, as she banged away on the typewriter, she could feel the Presence stalking ever closer, urging her on, supporting her, filling her, inspiring her.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"What the hell is going on, Charleston?" said Helen, one day when they were both at the tail-end of a Yellow high.</p>\n<p>"How's your poetry going?" he replied evasively.</p>\n<p>Excellent, she said. She had been writing about the photographs she had taken of the "real world", the New York City she was from. A lot were of the abandoned Suicide Center in Washington Square. "It was closed up in the 1930s. Liberal administration took over."</p>\n<p>"Wait a second. Suicide <em>Center</em>?"</p>\n<p>"Yeah. You could show up and get yourself killed if you really wanted to. Not going to say no one got purged ever."</p>\n<p>"Sounds like a very political situation."</p>\n<p>"Well, we have our own Cold War, you know."</p>\n<p>"Really? Between who and who?"</p>\n<p>"The US and the USSR, of course," she said, but gave him a slantwise look as if she were hiding something.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464996/#Comment_464996" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-24T20:02:27+00:00" title="July 24, 2017  8:02PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: Broken Night (Part 1)</b>\n<p>Give me back my broken night</p>\n<p>my mirrored room, my secret life</p>\n<p>it's lonely here,</p>\n<p>there's no one left to torture\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2014Leonard Cohen, \u201cThe Future\u201d</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Armed with the letter from Millicent, Jimmy convinced the rest of them that their best chance of finding Cassie's trail was to head to Arkham and see what Millicent had been investigating. They began to make preparations for the long drive north, aided by Isabelle O'Donnell and her collection of amiable monsters. Temperance's mother, Ruby Fitzgibbons Cuevas, flew out from California (in her own plane; she was still quite a pilot) to collect Rudy and Charlie. It was a surprise visit; she still knew how to make an entrance.</p>\n<p><em>[TP requested this scene; in our </em>Eternal Lies<em> campaign they had played Ruby.

Jimmy jumped up, twenty year old reflexes snapping back into action. "So good to see you again. I didn't know you were back in business. Hello, Temperance. Give me a cigarette, won't you?"</p>\n<p>"I\u2014you\u2014what\u2014" stuttered Temperance, lighting the cigarette she placed in her mother's elegant ivory holder.</p>\n<p>"Well, I\u2014" said Jimmy, and he beat a hasty retreat without an intelligible word.</p>\n<p>Ruby followed him with her eyes. Unnervingly, she held her cigarette holder in her artificial arm. "I'm here to pick up my children. I got a strange call from Rudy. He was crying on the phone, I'll never hear the end of it from Geronimo."</p>\n<p>"My stepfather can be a bit protective. They're fine."</p>\n<p><em>[We had a brief aside at this point about how Ruby and Geronimo must contemplate suing Lucy and Ricky Ricardo; and pondering what a rebooted </em>I Love Ruby<em> would be like\u2014Ruby no doubt whining and scheming to join Geronimo's mercenary company off to fight with the Socialists somewhere in Latin America.]</em></p>\n<p>"They don't look fine, Temperance." Ruby sighed. "I suppose it's all <em>my fault</em>. I haven't always been there for you."</p>\n<p>"Can I talk to you frankly?" Temperance went to the bar and made them a pair of martinis, extra dry. The room was quiet and filled with unsaid tension.</p>\n<p>Temperance handed her mother the drink. "Was it because of all this?" she said in a low voice. "The reason you left me in Mexico? Was it because of...all this. Ever since I joined Mr. Wright on his adventures I've seen things. Things that before would only have been the worries of nuns or priests. But I found them to be real."</p>\n<p>"James does have that effect on people."</p>\n<p>"All these things I thought were made up stories turned out to be true. And so I can understand if that's why you wanted me out of harm's way, and left me in Mexico."</p>\n<p>"Oh darling, I wish that were the case. Perhaps if I had known more, I would have made sure you stayed there when we got back from India.\u201d Ruby paused. \u201cNo, dear, it was that my parents couldn't stand the thought of what I had done\u2014the trouble I had gotten into. And your father and I were...well, we were a little combustible."</p>\n<p>"He's told me stories. Not all of them are flattering. To either of you."</p>\n<p>"I do...love you. Just because I have Rudy and Charlie doesn't mean I don't care for you."</p>\n<p>"But you left me in Mexico."</p>\n<p>"Well, I <em>had </em>you."</p>\n<p>"If that's any consolation."</p>\n<p>"I left you with your father, in the end. Somehow you turned out to be a much better person than Captain Murphy ever was."</p>\n<p>"Did he ever tell you what he did with the ship? He burned it. He got drunk on the beach and he burned it. Because he didn't have time to go to sea anymore, he told me. That he had a daughter to raise. But he cried while it burned. And then he took me clothes shopping."</p>\n<p>"Ashley was always a very dramatic person."</p>\n<p>"You seem to share that trait."</p>\n<p>"That's why we were combustible. To be honest, Temperance, and I don't know how you managed to pull this off, but you could really be <em>Geronimo's</em> daughter: upright, good, devout...like he is."</p>\n<p>"Geronimo did a good job of making me feel included. He's a good man, I respect him."</p>\n<p>"And now you hang around with Jimmy."</p>\n<p>"He's quite a character," said Temperance resignedly. "He's old, and he's tired, but he won't stop walking they beat."</p>\n<p>"He's the most interesting man I ever met. And it's a shame to see what he's become," said Ruby.</p>\n<p>"Does it really eat you alive, all of this?"</p>\n<p>"No...not as long as I stay in the light. You'll find, I think\u2014darling\u2014that when you fight in the shadows, you fight with your shadow-self as well. My shadow-self is...rather shady."</p>\n<p>"You don't say."</p>\n<p>"And I had a <em>thing</em> in the Thirties. It was a different era. FDR, the Japanese, it was all crazy!"</p>\n<p>"Things seem to have toned down now."</p>\n<p>"That's true, we could all die at any moment. A feeling I got quite used to during 1937." Ruby glanced slyly at Temperance. "I don't suppose you've come across any...substance...honey-colored, maybe?"</p>\n<p>"Once."</p>\n<p>"Really? Where?"</p>\n<p>"In a bunker in Nevada."</p>\n<p>"Nevada, you say."</p>\n<p>"I think it was like that yellowish substance all the bohemians take..."</p>\n<p>"Oh, Yellow? Not the same at all. Not that it matters. I'm clean now."</p>\n<p>"I think you should take Rudy and Charlie now."</p>\n<p>"Yes. Yes. I don't want them on the line of fire. Frankly, if I had known that you were working with Jimmy, I probably wouldn't have sent them out."</p>\n<p>"I didn't realize things were complicated between you two."</p>\n<p>"Just make sure you take better care of yourself than he did."</p>\n<p>"Have fun, Ruby."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465036/#Comment_465036" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-25T17:28:57+00:00" title="July 25, 2017  5:28PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: Broken Night (Part 2)</b>\n<p>"Mr. Wright, who was that beautiful lady?" asked Beth. She had found Jimmy in the closet he had retreated to. He was cleaning their guns. Rather tensely.</p>\n<p>"A walking disaster," he said morosely.</p>\n<p>"But she was so elegant! And she seemed so nice! She said that she liked my dress and found it very unusual."</p>\n<p>"She's mellowed out a bit, but I don't think..."</p>\n<p>"Oh. Oh! Oh." Beth's face fell.</p>\n<p>"That's the posh for you," said Jimmy, and he pulled the door closed. Beth went upstairs and sat down in Candace's room. She was sorting through the stacks of typescript on her desk, and dresser, and nightstand, and by the bed, and on the bed, and on the windowsill...</p>\n<p>"Candace?\u201d said Beth. \u201cI can't ask Temperance about this for reasons that will become extremely evident. This whole...half-dead spinster academic thing I've been doing, I don't want that to be me anymore...I'm still young. I can look different."</p>\n<p>"Oh honey, I've been in your situation before," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Should I get a...permanent?" She looked up at Candace with her large eyes, blurry behind their glasses.</p>\n<p>"Well, why not. Have fun! You should be having fun!"</p>\n<p>"I don't follow Vogue or anything like that..."</p>\n<p>"I can take you to the hairdresser. Nothing like a fresh change."</p>\n<p>"I asked Mrs. O'Donnell, but her clothes are so old-fashioned. It's like she died in the <em>Twenties</em> or something."</p>\n<p>"Just give me five minutes."</p>\n<p>An hour later, after she had run out of typewriter ribbons, Candace remembered her promise and ran downstairs to find Beth.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Neal and Jack left them in New Orleans, heading back out on the road, to coin a term. The rest of them drove the RV north. It was big enough for all of them to sleep in it, which was appreciated by Mencius until they were well clear of the Mason-Dixon line.</p>\n<p>Candace was driving late one night, on the approaches to New Jersey. She had one of the wildcat radio stations from over the Mexican border on\u2014a 100,000 watt clear channel transmission that could probably be tuned in up by Lake Erie. The program was bop jazz, hosted by a woman calling herself Isis.</p>\n<p>"This goes out to all the Lonesome Travelers out there," she purred through the speakers. "If you're out there all alone, and you feel that presence coming up behind you, just a reminder: embrace it. Here's a dedication, a King Creole cut. To Candace, somewhere in America."</p>\n<p>It wasn't until long after that Candace realized the voice had been familiar to her: the saloonkeeper in New Orleans. Hypatia Masters.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>They stopped in New York. It was the first time back to his old home for Jimmy since he had passed through in 1945 while getting demobbed.</p>\n<p>Candace had a crash in Greenwich Village, a very artistic couple of young men that were so solicitous of Temperance that for whole minutes at a time she forgot to be uncomfortable. They took an evening to head up to Birdland in the West 50s and troll the hard drinking musicians' bars around it.</p>\n<p>"I don't get it. I try to get it, but I don't get it," muttered Temperance during a particularly abstract solo by Dizzy Gillespie.</p>\n<p>"It's all right, others see more meaning, but you don't have to. Just try to enjoy it," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"I am enjoying it."</p>\n<p>\xa0"Would you like a drink?"</p>\n<p>"Yes. Many."</p>\n<p>"I think I get it," said Beth brightly. "You have to hear what they're <em>not</em> playing."</p>\n<p>"That's so asinine!" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"When you drink something other than a Shirley Temple, you can get back to me," said Beth with remarkable brio.</p>\n<p>"I'm drinking scotch and soda."</p>\n<p>"That's a very manly drink," said a barfly, with a bit of a leer.</p>\n<p>"What are you drinking?"</p>\n<p>"Martini."</p>\n<p>"Is it any good?"</p>\n<p>"Very."</p>\n<p>"I'll have a martini."</p>\n<p>"I'll get it for you, doll,\u201d said the barfly.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465100/#Comment_465100" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-27T16:44:29+00:00" title="July 27, 2017  4:44PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2017 4:44PM by Aviatrix.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: Broken Night (Part 3)</b>\n<p>Sam dropped by one of the chem labs at Columbia.

The city was made of graceful spires and elegant bridges that connected floating platforms. From time to time beautiful, wasp-waisted rocket ships lifted from some edge of the city and threw themselves into the void.</p>\n<p>He watched them with pleasure for a few moments. When he lowered his eyes, he saw Percival Schicksal standing in front of him\u2014not the twisted creature he had encountered underneath the Nevada desert, but Percy as he remembered him, a trim figure in a grey suit with curling black hair and smiling eyes.</p>\n<p>"Sam! Glad to see you finally made it!" said Percy.</p>\n<p>"You look better than the last time I saw you," said Sam.</p>\n<p>"That was just my physical form."</p>\n<p>"You have more than one?"</p>\n<p>"I float between many worlds now."</p>\n<p>"Am I back here permanently?"</p>\n<p>"Probably not.

Welcome to the Raketen-Stadt: Rocket City," said Percy, waving his arms around.</p>\n<p>"Is this a German city?"</p>\n<p>"Let's just say that a lot of people dream of escape and find it represented here. There's a rocket that will take you to Hlanith or whatever it was called. I don't want to go there, too Currier and Ives for me. Or we can go further on.

You'll have a chance to go there soon enough."</p>\n<p>"I take it you've been there."</p>\n<p>"Oh yes," said Percy softly.</p>\n<p>"What sustains it?"</p>\n<p>"Interesting question."</p>\n<p>"We're scientists."</p>\n<p>"Carcosa sustains itself. It is a world outside of time. Very hard to get in...or out."</p>\n<p>"I hear it destroys itself and renews itself constantly."</p>\n<p>"I wouldn't say that. It's in a perpetual state of unchanging. And yet it changes: details, though, just the details."</p>\n<p>"I want to make this in our own image."</p>\n<p>"You might not like the result."</p>\n<p>"Look at the world we live in now. We've unlocked the atom only to try to use it to kill ourselves. We need to evolve."</p>\n<p>"I'm not sure Carcosa is the answer to that."</p>\n<p>"I don't think we should overlook any opportunity."</p>\n<p>"Well, I'll pass that along."</p>\n<p>"To who?"</p>\n<p>"Top men. The men in charge. You'll get to meet them soon, and I'm sure then you'll sign on with the program. But now you got to go back."</p>\n<p>"I don't want to leave! This is where I belong!"</p>\n<p>"Not yet....not yet..." And everything faded away.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy had stayed with the RV, which was parked at Idlewild airport. He didn't mind the immediate squalor; at his age (or more accurately, with his mileage) he didn't need the excitement of the Big Apple anymore. Plus he had been feeling vaguely <em>off</em> somehow ever since that terrible night on the paddlewheeler in New Orleans: vaguely discontented and angry. Twitchy.</p>\n<p>He had made a dismal if serviceable dinner from a can of beans and some bread and was sipping a whisky next to the big bay window on the left side of the RV. Out on the edge of the lot he could see the local working girls plying their trade. As he watched, he saw a man dragging a woman out amidst the cars. He threw her up against the side of one of them. "Bitch, I'm not paying you for what you did," screamed the man.</p>\n<p>Jimmy sighed, got up, and rummaged in the weapons locker\u2014the one with "Sporting Equipment" painted in day-glo letters on the hatch, in a weak attempt at subterfuge. He pulled out a baseball bat, slung it over his shoulder, and stepped out onto the asphalt.</p>\n<p>As he sauntered up to them, he could hear the woman crying. "You should really learn some manners," he said, loud enough to make the john pause with one fist raised to strike the woman.</p>\n<p>"Who the fuck are you?" said the john.</p>\n<p>"The guy who is going hurt you very badly if you don't mind your manners," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Go to hell, old man," said the john. He turned back to the girl.</p>\n<p>Jimmy sighed, and let his shoulders droop. Then he spun, sliding the bat off his shoulder and jabbing it forward. The man turned around and took the bat right in the solar plexus. He sat down hard, blood dripping from his mouth.</p>\n<p><em>[JP used Jimmy's Maneuver reserve to pick up an extra benefit on the roll: here, it was "No Traces" so this guy took one where it won't show.]</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy raised the bat again. Suddenly he was in a blinding, violent rage. He wanted to smash this guy's skull in. He wanted to see the blood flowing under the sulphur lights.</p>\n<p><em>[Sudden two point Driver to do violence! I wonder why...]</em></p>\n<p>The john looked up and caught the glimmer of murderous rage in Jimmy's eyes. He coughed, rolled up into a crouching run, and got away as fast as he could. Jimmy helped the girl up to her feet. "Thanks, mister," she sniffed. Jimmy's ankle itched as he helped her to the RV. He poured her a glass of water and gave her a washcloth to clean up with.</p>\n<p>With her makeup off, she wasn't bad looking. Quite good looking, as a matter of fact. He felt a strange urge that took him a moment to process: lust. He hadn't wanted someone this badly in a long time.</p>\n<p><em>What the hell is going on?</em> he thought. He reached for his wallet. "You better get going," he said to her, handing her a sawback. "Go. Make better life choices. Get the hell out!"

Past the Howard Johnson's on the interstate, down the low hills with a few patches of snow under the pine trees, and into the sleepy Boston exurb that was home to Miskatonic University.</p>\n<p>There were new housing developments on the north side of the river, but downtown still had a carefully-manicured colonial charm. Temperance smiled, remembering the fresh boys that had come down to the bars near Wellesley when she had been there. Very grabby, she remembered. Like they had tentacles for arms.</p>\n<p>They parked at a garage and walked down to the Macallister building on Pickman Street, Millicent Lowell's last known address. It was an average looking three-story building, except for the castle motif: gargoyles and fake crenulations, even a mock portcullis. Much to no one's surprise, Millicent didn't answer her buzzer. But when Jimmy tried ringing all the other bells, no one answered them.</p>\n<p>"She went to Miskatonic," said Candace. "We could check the alumni association."</p>\n<p>"You wearing a different perfume, Beth?" said Jimmy in a low voice.</p>\n<p>"Yes, I am. I'm surprised you noticed," said Beth, beaming. "Surprised you noticed anything given how drunk you are," she muttered to herself.</p>\n<p>They walked down to Miskatonic and Candace ingratiated herself with the staff. Down at the alumni association, they found a bright young lady named Jill. "Oh, Miss Lowell...yes, she came by...it was always so interesting to see Millicent. She really hasn't changed at all since college. She was teaching high school down in Boston."</p>\n<p>"When was the last time she came by?"</p>\n<p>"December, seems like. She met President Peaslee, that's...odd."</p>\n<p>"Perhaps they knew each other. Is the Professor in?"</p>\n<p>Jill gave them a look. "He might be. Is that Miss Temperance Murphy over there? Her father has contributed a lot to the school....let me see what I can do..."</p>\n<p><em>[To meet the president, you needed both High Society and a Counterculture </em>UNDER<em> 2. President Peaslee doesn't meet any riff-raff.]</em></p>\n<p>And an hour later Temperance, Jimmy, Sam and Candace were shown into the office of Wingate Peaslee, member of a Miskatonic dynasty. "I knew Miss Lowell very well," he said after the formalities were over. He was in his sixties, one of that specimen of New Englander that gets worn down to a hard, rounded nub as they get older: he had white hair combed in the style of the 1920s, and wore a three-piece suit with a watch on a chain. "She was quite a gifted student. Bit of a strange girl, but we don't hold that against anyone here. She came into town and decided to stay a while. This was back in December, before the break."</p>\n<p>"How was she strange?" asked Sam.</p>\n<p>"Was she different than usual?" broke in Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"No, she was exactly as she used to be. A bit crazy-eyed...well, you seem to know her."</p>\n<p>"President Peaslee, I'm sure a man of your education in these things could help us," said Sam, laying it on thick; he'd learned how to do that from budget meetings at his school.</p>\n<p><em>[Flattery use</em>.<em>]</em></p>\n<p>"Well, since you're friends of hers...she was looking for a woman, for some friend of hers in New Orleans. She took a room here in town. I don't know much more, she spent most of her time on campus talking to Professor Wilmarth. The building she was staying at is a bit interesting...it was built on the site of one of our most haunted buildings."</p>\n<p>"I always find stories like that amusing. What was this one?"</p>\n<p>"It was the old Keziah Mason house. She was a witch, burnt by Judge Hathorne back in the 17th century. Sad times back then. In the 1930s one of our students here was living there. Had a bit of a breakdown, I guess; claimed he saw Mason coming out of the corner of his room. Said he saw a black man who made him sign the Book of Satan or something. There was also some unpleasantness with an immigrant family as well. In any case they tore it down and built an apartment building on the lot."</p>\n<p><em>[That's the plot of Lovecraft's </em>Dreams of the Witch House<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>TP: Some unpleasantness? That is a white people answer for sure.]</em></p>\n<p>Peaslee leaned back in his chair. "I tell you what," he said, as if he had reached a sudden decision. "I can send you over to Professor Wilmarth. He's having his office hour today. He's an emeritus professor now, but he does try to drop by once a week."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Professor Wilmarth was every inch what a retired New England professor of English should be: avuncular, with thick horn-rimmed glasses framed by a halo of unruly white hair, and a tweedy jacket still coated in chalk dust. "Millicent Lowell," he said when they arrived. "I remember her well; one of my best students. Liked to talk about D.H. Lawrence a lot. You're here from her friend in New Orleans, I take it? Well. She was searching for some woman; she found a building that she was supposed to have lived in multiple times. To me the pictures looked like different people, but she made some connection. The Artlife association on the north side of the river runs the Macallister as a kind of artist's colony. And Millicent was looking for the Box."</p>\n<p><em>[There was a running gag in </em>Eternal Lies<em> about Millicent reading Lawrence for the "dirty" parts.]</em></p>\n<p>"The Box?" said Temperance and Jimmy.</p>\n<p>It was an interesting artifact, said Professor Wilmarth. Back in 1938 they University had, somewhat unbelievably, sent a botanical expedition to the Pyrenees, despite the Civil War in Spain; supposedly it had the support of the French and British. (The professor implied heavily that espionage was involved in the British interest.) It was led by Professor Francis Morgan, who had fallen under the spell of a young coed named Cordelia Gelbpfluchtig. Morgan was a good friend of Professor Armitage, though, and that rolled over any objections. Sadly, the expedition was massacred by Carlist militias.</p>\n<p>"We thought everyone died," said Wilmarth. "But in 1940 a girl from it turned up in Toulouse, by the name of Milla DeVille. Half out of her wits; we had to commit her. She never really explained what she saw other than to say things like 'The Horror from the Hills' and 'the Idol moved!'"</p>\n<p>But she had brought the Box back with her. It was carved of teak, maybe Indian or Chinese. Professor Armitage examined it, and then sent it to the Orne Library Special Collections. And only people with the permission of the Select Committee were allowed to examine the collection.</p>\n<p>"Did Millicent get permission?" asked Sam.</p>\n<p>Professor Wilmarth admitted he was on the Committee, and had indeed granted Millicent permission. Sam asked for the same privilege, and after some hemming and hawing, the Professor gave in.</p>\n<p><em>[Flattery spend by SP.]</em></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465129/#Comment_465129" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-29T04:56:02+00:00" title="July 29, 2017  4:56AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought it was Lady Chatterly's Lover that Millicent read.

"We have a Miskatonic where I'm from," said Helen. "Big research school."</p>\n<p>"I hear the same about this one," said Charleston. He ambled up to a gangly looking senior. "Say, man, where's the fun places around here?"</p>\n<p>"There are some coffee houses around. They play folk music there mostly," he replied.</p>\n<p>"I don't mean fun like that. I mean, this place has a reputation that's a bit <em>haunted</em>\u2014"</p>\n<p>"That's overblown, old-timer. I didn't come here for any mumbo-jumbo. My dad came here, and I'm going to end up with a good job in Boston."</p>\n<p>"Waste of my time," Charleston muttered darkly. He and Helen went to the campus bookstore and bought a Fighting Squids pennant.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Sam spent the rest of the day combing through the archives. A surprising amount of things had been donated by a Freddie Blakely, by the name didn't mean anything to him. Finally he located the boxes that should have had anything from the Pyrenees expedition, but they were empty.</p>\n<p>He spent some more time trying to find the right box, but eventually had to go back to the grad student who had been left in charge to try and run through the history of people who had requested the Pyrenees artifacts, guessing one of them had removed the Box. He narrowed it down to a coed named Yolanda Vierge, who had studied for a single semester in 1947. It seemed, according to campus scuttlebutt, that she had been very close to Professor Wilmarth.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Candace, Temperance and Jimmy dropped in on Artlife. "We're an artists' collective," the nice middle-aged lady explained to them. They offered reduced rent to working artists in their building.</p>\n<p>"I'm very interested in staying there," said Candace. "I'm working on finishing my new novel and could use some isolation."</p>\n<p>"Oh, you're <em>that</em> Candace Heartbrooke! I loved your novel! Great, great, very good..." While she worked on getting the paperwork, Temperance struck up a conversation with her. It seemed that one of the reasons she was so happy to hear that Candace was interested in the building was that nobody there had paid their rent in some time.</p>\n<p><em>[Negotiate use by TP.]</em></p>\n<p>"Artists not paying their rent, eh? How surprising," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"A family friend was supposed to be living there," said Jimmy. "Millicent."</p>\n<p>"Miss Lowell? She hasn't paid her rent either, though of course we have the deposit..."</p>\n<p>"I'd be more than happy to cover her rent," said Candace. "So she won't be evicted."</p>\n<p><em>[TP and JP then shot rock paper scissors to decide who made the Negotiate spend to loosen up the Artlife lady.]</em></p>\n<p>After that, asking casually if they might get Millicent's spare key so they could check on her was easy enough. Lease in hand, they headed out to the Macallister building.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Millicent's apartment was <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231FE&amp;Mode=like">#1FE</a>. It was kept meticulously neat, except for a few romance novels and a couple of crime novels by J.R. Stolt. In the closet there was almost no clothing at all, just a nice suit, and a cocktail dress hanging forlornly and alone.</p>\n<p>"No suitcase," said Candace. "She packed up, these aren't everyday clothes."</p>\n<p>Jimmy pulled a note out of the mirror frame it had been wedged in. "Just says to contact Erica Grey in Sacramento if she isn't back by February," he said.</p>\n<p>Temperance pulled open the desk drawer and found a sketch map of the building...she thought. There were scrawled notes on it: "Roses." "Bread and Butter." Along the edge of the map doors had been drawn in pencil.</p>\n<p>Charleston flopped down on the bed, pulled open the nightstand drawer, and came up with a pile of typewritten pages. They seemed to form a screenplay of some kind. The beginning and end seemed to be missing, but as he flipped through it he kept track of the names of the characters: Thomas Manuel, Roger Carom, Louise Post. All of them had been listed on the building directory in the lobby.</p>\n<p>"Helen, run through this script with me," he said.</p>\n<p>"What kind of ridiculous thing is this?' she mutter.

The man who opened it was wearing an artist's smock, streaked with various shades of paint. Temperance asked if he knew the woman across the hall.</p>\n<p>"Lily?" the man said. "Yeah, I knew her."</p>\n<p>"What?" said Jimmy. "Lily?"</p>\n<p>"Sure, her name was Millicent but I called her Lily. Tom Manuel," the man said, holding out his hand.</p>\n<p>"Do you know when she'll be back?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Oh, she's probably left Arkham. She was a free spirit. Come on in."</p>\n<p>They filed past him. "I like your work," said Candace, who had seen a few of his paintings in Cambridge galleries. "Candace Heartbrooke. Novelist. <em>Homefront</em>?" she trailed off.</p>\n<p>"I don't read a lot of women's literature."</p>\n<p><em>[Counterculture 2+ snagged the name &amp; reputation of Manuel.]</em></p>\n<p>The room was austere and bare: no books, no record player, no radio. There was not even an easel; the only thing interesting that Jimmy saw was a large reel-to-reel recorder.</p>\n<p>"The manager lets me paint downstairs," said Manuel, noticing Candace's surprised look.</p>\n<p>"Do you have to share the space with anyone?"</p>\n<p>Michelle and Roger were writers, Manuel said, and Louise was an illustrator. So he was the only <em>serious</em> artist, and the only painter. Jimmy asked about the tape recorder; Manuel said he should probably get rid of it, like he had done with his books and music, but it was a gift from his parents. Still, it was just a distraction, like the other things. He should probably get rid of it.</p>\n<p>Temperance frowned. Manuel's body language indicated that he was lying; but his eyes didn't show the signs of fabrication. Could it be that he <em>didn't know he was lying</em>?</p>\n<p><em>[BS Detector 1-point spend.]</em></p>\n<p>Jimmy flipped on the tape player. He didn't hear anything from the speakers, just the low hiss of tape speeding past the magnetic heads. "Hey!" said Manuel. "Stop screwing with my stuff! Coming into my house when it's almost dark..."</p>\n<p>"You afraid of the dark?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"No. Of course not. Just...it's almost dark...look, I don't know what happened to that girl. Why don't you go ask Michelle or Roger, or creepy Louise on the top floor."</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about the player,\u201d said Temperance. \u201cCome along, <em>father</em>,\u201d she said to Jimmy.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The grad student Sam had been berating offered to give him a ride. "That's good," said Sam. "I'm really high on meth."</p>\n<p>"Why do people always tell me when they're high!" the poor kid moaned. "Where do you want to go?"</p>\n<p>"Interesting question," began Sam, but then hurried on when he got a withering glance from the kid. "That artists' colony building."</p>\n<p>"The MacAllister? They're all weirdos in there. I used to see one of them around, Louise Post. She's an illustrator, does a lot of science fiction magazines. Met her at a convention once. Robert Heinlein was there!"</p>\n<p><em>[In the original text of </em>Tatters of the King<em> there's a possibility to have Aleister Crowley make a cameo; when casting around for the 1950s equivalent, I pondered using RAH, but never was able to get him in.]</em></p>\n<p>"That's great," said Sam. "You have any keggers around here?"</p>\n<p>"Yeah, of course. I don't know where they are, I'm a grad student. Don't have time anymore. I used to see Louise around, bought her a cup of coffee. Trying to make her, to be honest. Guess the last time was before Halloween. Columbus Day, that neighborhood has a lot of immigrants, so it's a big deal."</p>\n<p>He dropped Sam off as the shadows were growing long in the street. He buzzed the door. "Let me in, I'm coming down," he told Jimmy, who answered the buzz.</p>\n<p>"Doesn't he mean coming up?" said Temperance. Jimmy shook his head.</p>\n<p>They split up. Jimmy and Temperance went up a flight and knocked on Michelle Vanfitz's door. It opened with a jerk. Ms. Vanfitz was a shortish woman with even shorter hair, an assertive jut to her jaw, and eyes that showed appreciation for Temperance's charms. She was wearing a sleeveless tee shirt and men's dungarees. "Well hello," she purred at Temperance. "You from the building?"</p>\n<p>"We're looking for Millicent."</p>\n<p>"Oh, her. Come on in." She waved Temperance through but tried to close the door in Jimmy's face. "So sorry. Didn't see you there," she smirked.</p>\n<p>The room was wall-to-wall bookshelves, with a small couch in one corner. The books were all of philosophy and feminist criticism; <em>Le deuxi\xe8me sexe</em> was displayed prominently, and the few pieces of art were mostly paintings of Sappho. Well, of Sapphic themes, in any case. "Can I get you a drink?\u201d asked Michelle. \u201cIt's five o'clock."</p>\n<p>"Water is fine," said Temperance, clenching her jaw. "Did you know Millicent?"</p>\n<p>"Yeah, I would see her in the hallway. Creepy looking girl."</p>\n<p>"We\u2019re friends of hers, just in the neighborhood, on our way to...Maine. You have a lovely home. I like your books..."</p>\n<p>"Do you know them? De Beauvoir is an amazing writer. One is not <em>born</em> a woman, one <em>becomes </em>one, because in the eyes of society, women aren't <em>human</em>..."</p>\n<p>While she ranted, Jimmy cast a discerning eye around the room. The only thing unusual he noted was a copy of <em>The King in Yellow</em>\u2014the 1947 Penguin Classics edition, of course. He tried to point it out to Temperance, who was making little headway with her halfhearted interjections.</p>\n<p>"It seems like you have an interesting collection...<em>Tropic of Cancer</em>..."</p>\n<p>"I only keep that out for the zeitgeist. Miller is a pig," said Michelle.</p>\n<p>"Is that a copy of <em>The King in Yellow</em>?"</p>\n<p>"Oh, that. Not a good play.

He proved to be a dapper, neatly dressed in slacks and a shirt and tie. He had fine features and delicate hands, and an accent from somewhere south of the Mason-Dixon line. "Should I know you?"</p>\n<p>"Perhaps. My name is Candace. I wanted to inquire about a friend of mine, Millicent."</p>\n<p>"Was she that dumpy little thing who lived down on the first floor? I knew her a little bit. We had a New Year's Eve party here, I got to talk to her a little bit. Where are my manners? Come on in."</p>\n<p>His apartment was rather, well, prissy: tastefully decorated, with elegant throw rugs and a couch in an understated modern style. On a large desk desperately trying to look like a French Empire piece was an expensive electric typewriter. He had a few bookcases; the one closest to the door had several science fiction novels displayed prominently, with one tilted so that guests could see that the author picture was of him.</p>\n<p>"Are you a new resident in the building?" said Carun.</p>\n<p>"No, but we're staying in Millicent's place until we can figure out where she went. I'm a writer."</p>\n<p>"Oh, I'm a writer too. I write science fiction. I wrote a series called <em>Nightsea</em>. I think that science fiction can be more than just about little green men with ray guns. What do you write, dear?"</p>\n<p>"Well...my style has changed a lot. I wrote a novel about my acceptance and growth after the death of my husband overseas," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"That was a terrible time. Were you a war widow? I was a war widower. My, uh, girlfriend died in the war. She was a very sweet, lady..."</p>\n<p>Candace tried to take it all in stride. "Lately I have let my writing be inspired by all sort of things. Have you ever been in San Francisco?"</p>\n<p>"Oh, I have spent <em>quite</em> a lot of time in San Francisco,\u201d said Roger. \u201cI really enjoyed the waterfront."</p>\n<p>"I made several friends out there, very inspiring."</p>\n<p>"It's about time that California made an impact on culture beyond those insipid movies. Whatever happened to Busby Berkeley? Now there was an artist."</p>\n<p>"That's an interesting thought."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Upstairs, Charleston and Sam knocked on Louise Post's door. "Who is it?" groaned a voice from inside.</p>\n<p>"We're friends of Millicent's," said Sam.</p>\n<p>"The door is open. You can come in if you want."</p>\n<p>The room was very dark. The lights were out, and the blinds were drawn. It was also filthy: empty boxes of Chinese food were scattered around, and papers were strewn everywhere.</p>\n<p>"Can we turn on the lights?" said Sam.</p>\n<p>"I'm afraid I'm rather light sensitive," said Louise. She was sitting far back in the room, in an armchair, shrouded in shadow. "I always was, but then I took some antibiotics and they made it much worse. I suppose you could sit near the door and use the reading lamp..."</p>\n<p>Charleston tapped his way inside, "blind" once again. "Reminds me of my place in New York. You aren't still sick? Is it contagious?"</p>\n<p>"No, not anymore," said Louise.</p>\n<p>"When was the last time you saw Millicent?" said Sam. In the dim light from the hall, he could see she was wearing dark glasses.</p>\n<p>Louise looked up at Charleston. "Oh, are you blind?" she said.</p>\n<p>"Yes, yes," said Charleston. Sam flicked on the reading lamp, and in the flare of light Charleston could see that Louise didn't have any <em>eyes</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[CP: That's all right, I'm not here to judge.]</em></p>\n<p>"I like your tie," she said to Charleston, who was wearing traditional Chinese clothing as usual.</p>\n<p>"Uh huh." Sam shook his head; he'd heard of something like this before, but it was pretty rare: a psychological disorder where despite organic blindness, the patient was convinced that they could actually see.</p>\n<p>"I'm working on several projects," said Louise. "They're not finished yet..."</p>\n<p>"How long have you been in this place?"</p>\n<p>"The sun is going down," said Louise, a bit strangely.</p>\n<p>"It has a tendency to do that," said Sam.</p>\n<p>"Then I can get to work." She pushed out of the chair and walked with determination over to her drafting desk. She took down a mirror and put it on the board next to her. "I hope you don't mind me working. Is that traditional Chinese clothes?" she said to Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I don't know," said Charleston. "I'm American."</p>\n<p>"What an interesting face. Do you mind if I use you as a reference?"</p>\n<p>"I'm flattered."</p>\n<p>She sketched him for a while, quite accurately. Then she looked up sharply. Her dark glasses slipped down her face, exposing her empty eyesockets. "Why did you do that?" she said to him sharply. "You could <em>see</em> before, but now you have eyes again. Why would you do that?"</p>\n<p>"<em>I</em> didn't do that," groused Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I didn't ask for this," muttered Sam. He watched Louise work. He could see her reflection in the mirror begin to change. It became indistinct but quite definitely <em>not</em> her reflection. <em>Great, the LSD is coming back</em>, he thought morosely.</p>\n<p>Whatever it was in the mirror <em>tapped</em> on the glass sharply.</p>\n<p><em>[And at this point everyone in the building lost a point of Stability as night fell.]</em></p>\n<p>"In a minute. I'm busy," said Louise grumpily. "Now about your eyes..."</p>\n<p>"It wasn't up to me!" said Charleston, loudly. "I didn't have a choice!"</p>\n<p>"Well. Maybe you should look in the Box. I keep it under the bed for safekeeping."</p>\n<p>"Don't let me interrupt your work," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"You couldn't if you wanted to."</p>\n<p>"Wait," said Sam. "Yolanda? No? Okay, then how do you have the Box?"</p>\n<p>She had gone to Miskatonic, Louise explained, about six months ago. She had been searching in their occult section, looking for inspiration for a science fiction magazine cover she had been hired to paint. Instead, she found the Box; it had been misfiled. She hadn't wanted to steal it, but somehow she couldn't leave it...so she took it home, and began looking at what was in it. And then she had shown it to other people.</p>\n<p>"When did you show it to Millicent?" asked Sam.</p>\n<p>She had had to wait until Millicent got around to asking her; and she had to wait until night, of course. She hadn't waited for everyone to ask her directly, but Thomas had looked right away. Roger had taken a while\u2014he wasn't that interested. Michelle, on the other hand, had wanted to look immediately.</p>\n<p>Charleston meanwhile had slid the Box out from under the bed. It wasn't very big, but it was ornately carved in a language that wasn't Chinese or Hindi. While Charleston fiddled with it, Sam shot up some Yellow.</p>\n<p><em>[Sam's first experience with Yellow!]</em></p>\n<p>When the first shock of the hit subsided, he could see a staircase in the middle of the room that hadn't been there before. He also felt some change in the space, as if the apartment had suddenly sprouted several more rooms. As he blinked, deliriously, a shabby old basset hound came creeping down the stairs. It sat there, halfway up, and wagged its tail.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465283/#Comment_465283" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-02T21:13:03+00:00" title="August  2, 2017  9:13PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think I was trying to kick Jimmy in the feels.</p></div></blockquote>\nIt probably kicked Millicent in the feels too.

Jimmy and Temperance waited a long, uncomfortable time. After a while they could hear music coming from far away...but inside the room. As if there was suddenly more space there.</p>\n<p>They decided to take the opportunity and fled downstairs. The door to Thomas' apartment was open, and they could see him lowering a microphone attached by a long cable to his reel-to-reel recorder through a hole in the floor. "Hi guys," he said when he noticed them. "You're the ones who were asking about Lily. Millicent. Yeah, I kind of envy her; she figured it out and found the way. Upstairs. With that guy on six, the book salesman. We had a going-away party for her, since she was going to go find her way..."</p>\n<p>Yes, she had gone up the stairs to the sixth floor, he answered in reply to Jimmy's question. Past the green room. In the night floors.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"Oh, the sun has gone down," said Roger Carun, taking Candace's empty teacup. "I'm going to go dress for dinner. Would you like to come with me? Yes? Good, I'll be just a moment." He padded off to his bedroom.</p>\n<p>When he came back he was wearing nothing but suspenders, dance tights, and nipple clips. "Oh, I'm only half-dressed," he clucked to himself, picking up a bowler hat and placing it on his head at a jaunty angle.</p>\n<p>"Is there a party?" said Candace with aplomb.</p>\n<p>"There's always a party up on seven," said Roger.</p>\n<p>"I'm up for a party."</p>\n<p>She followed him up to the third floor, and then to the fourth floor...which hadn't been there before. "This building has more floors than I can count," he replied to her question. "Come with me to the Green Room."</p>\n<p>They emerged into what she was surprised to see looked like a green room, for a television show or a theater\u2014a waiting place where actors or guests could relax before going onstage. There was a table laden with food, much of it strange to her eyes. In one corner was a cabinet filled with bottles of what she guessed was alcohol\u2014there weren't any labels on most of them. The other corner had a walk-in humidor, which was definitely unusual.</p>\n<p>The lighting fixtures were gas, not electric, and there were buggy whips hung by the door. The magazines scattered around the tables were all from the end of the nineteenth century. On the walls were pictures, as most places like this had\u2014usually they were pictures of past productions, or celebrity actors. But as she looked closer, she saw that most of these pictures were pornographic, and many featured people with disabilities or deformities in them.</p>\n<p><em>[Me: Basically, it's Tod Browning's </em>Freaks<em> meets </em>Eyes Wide Shut<em>, that should get you there.]</em></p>\n<p>"This is a bit intense," she said.</p>\n<p>"Honey, this is just the green room,\u201d said Carun. \u201cWait til you get on stage...well, I assume there's a stage somewhere."</p>\n<p>"I'm not a performer, I'm a writer."</p>\n<p>"So am I, but trust me, I perform. Tell me, do you like getting whipped?"</p>\n<p>"No."</p>\n<p>"<em>Quelle dommage</em>. We had a spot for a girl in tonight's festivities. No matter. To be honest, I didn't really need a <em>girl</em> in it."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>"I'm interested in the King in Yellow," said Sam to Louise.</p>\n<p>"The play?"</p>\n<p>"The person."</p>\n<p>"I only know the play. I don't know any person."</p>\n<p>"Where's Millicent?"</p>\n<p>"She's gone. She found the Way. The Way forward...I guess. I don't know where it goes, I haven't found it yet. It's somewhere up on the Night Floors."</p>\n<p>"Why don't you go up there?" asked Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I do. But I'm just busy," she said, frowning. She tapped hard on the mirror.</p>\n<p>Charleston flipped through her portfolio. All the sketches were of a horrific nuclear holocaust. They had been commissioned by her client, she said. She didn\u2019t want to talk about them. Not in front of him.</p>\n<p>Charleston was still holding the box. Louise yelled at him as he began to walk toward the stairs. That was her Box. He couldn't take it outside her room! It was hers! She wasn't going to be fooled by people like him. No, he wasn't her <em>comrade</em>. He might get lost\u2014of course people got lost up there! Yes, Millicent had found the way. It was the way she said it, there was no doubt.</p>\n<p>Sam was practically pawing at the Box. With a sigh, Charleston opened it up.</p>\n<p>Inside was a sculpture, of rods and hemispheres. It was about the size of the inside of the box. It almost seemed to be breathing, somehow. Charleston tried to follow the pattern with his eyes, but he got lost in the myriad connections of it. Perspective seemed to be just wrong, like it was <em>suspended</em>. But then it was filling most of the area around him.</p>\n<p>Sam blinked. Something in the sculpture <em>blinked</em> back at him. Where, he couldn't tell, but then again it was almost half the size of the room.</p>\n<p>"Helen! Sketch this, would you!" he said.</p>\n<p>"How can I, I can barely see all of it, it's filling the room almost," Helen whispered.</p>\n<p>Charleston tried to touch the rods. He felt metal under his fingertips. But when he tried to move one, he got a small but painful shock. He closed the lid on the box.</p>\n<p>The room was empty again.</p>\n<p>"Louise," said Sam. "Do you want out? This could be the way."</p>\n<p>"No it isn't," she sighed. "Well. Maybe it will. I don't know. I have a commission. It's very important."</p>\n<p><em>[At this point I charged both Sam and Charleston 4 Stability.]</em></p>\n<p>"Daoloth," muttered Charleston. "The render of veils. If I stare at this long enough, it will pierce everyday reality and show us the true nature of the universe." He shook his head. "I've been trying to get back into that fake reality for decades." He looked up and saw the dog sitting on the staircase. He ambled over and patted it on the head. It barked.</p>\n<p><em>[Cthulhu Mythos spend here.]</em></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466206/#Comment_466206" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-11T17:59:30+00:00" title="September 11, 2017  5:59PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: Broken Night (Part 9)</b>\n<p>"You want us to follow you?" said Sam. The dog woofed. A ball came bouncing down the stairs. Charleston picked it up and threw it up the staircase. A moment later it came bouncing back down, followed by the dog. Sam shrugged and walked upstairs, followed by Charleston.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>They came out in the Green Room. Charleston nodded at Candace, and smiled at Roger.</p>\n<p>"Do you like to be whipped?" said Roger without preamble.</p>\n<p>"Nope," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"You sure?"</p>\n<p>"Unfortunately, all too sure."</p>\n<p>"Well, maybe I wasn't <em>asking</em>, bitch!" said Roger, backhanding Charleston across the face.</p>\n<p><em>[Chuckles took a point of damage here. TP pointed out that Roger would get kicked out of a dungeon, and I agreed (as I knew that); Roger is not a good model for safe and consensual BDSM by any means!]</em></p>\n<p>Temperance and Jimmy emerged into the room. Temperance was clutching Millicent's map to her chest. She glanced around the room and tried to find a corner to stare at that wouldn't make her feel uncomfortable. She wasn't having much success.</p>\n<p>"Well, ladies," said Roger. "I can't stay. Got a lot of people waiting to meet my whip tonight."</p>\n<p>"Where do you want us to go, boy?" asked Sam.</p>\n<p>"Why is he acting like there's a dog in the room?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Hey, imaginary dogs is actually an improvement for him," said Jimmy. Behind him, Michelle Vanfitz climbed into view, wearing an impeccably tailored tux <em>\xe1 la</em> Marlene Dietrich.</p>\n<p>"Oh God, the squares are here," she moaned. "Well, not you," she said to Charleston. "If you had a pussy, I'd fuck you."</p>\n<p>"Night is young," said Charleston. Michelle grinned and walked to the liquor cabinet and poured some purple liquid into a glass. Charleston walked over, sniffed a few bottles, and waved Sam over.</p>\n<p>"Hey professor, we got a chance to make something wild here," he said. Sam nodded eagerly and began to help Charleston whip together something interesting.</p>\n<p>"A compelling experience in ingestion," suggested Charleston.</p>\n<p><em>[I told SP that a 1-point spend of Pharmacy would let Sam whip up whatever his heart desired.]</em></p>\n<p>"Charleston," said Jimmy sharply. "Remember that you're trying to avoid this kind of thing."</p>\n<p>"Yeah, I know. I'm trying to figure out where we are," replied Charleston. "This isn't the Dreamlands, that much I know."</p>\n<p>"Sam, come on," said Jimmy. "There aren't any experimental protocols, you'll mess up your data." He hoped it would keep him from doing anything <em>too</em> stupid.</p>\n<p><em>[I think this was a Flattery use, or at least the attempt at one.]</em></p>\n<p>"Back in Paperclip we had to play loose with things," said Sam. But taking Charleston's advice, he tried to whip up something that would make the world a bit more sane, and poured it into his flask.</p>\n<p>Roger slunk up to Jimmy. "Mr. Wright, you sure you wouldn't want to come with me?" he purred. "You look like the type who is simply starving for violence."</p>\n<p>Jimmy gritted his teeth. Visions of pain, lovely lovely pain inflicted and received flitted through his head. <em>Not my ideas</em>, he thought. <em>Those come from the Liar</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[1 point Stability loss to Jimmy here.]</em></p>\n<p>"Jimmy, you need a distraction," said Charleston. "Maybe you could go fetch me something." He described the Box and told Jimmy where to find it under her bed.</p>\n<p>Jimmy dashed down the stairs and back into Louise's room. She was engrossed in her work, bent over her mirror. "Tell me again how beautiful I am," she said. Jimmy slipped past her, reached under the bed, and came up with the Box. He was back upstairs before she had time to look up.</p>\n<p><em>[Infiltration test here; JP scored an extra success and went with "Quick".]</em></p><p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance studied the map. "We need to get out of here. These people scare the hell out of me.</p>\n<p>"Temperance, you should be more open," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"That man has clamps on his nipples!"</p>\n<p>"You'd like some?" said Roger, holding out a pair.</p>\n<p>"Nope nope nope!" said Temperance, trying to shrink into herself. There was a way through. There had to be! Millicent found it...and she began to see a way, to move through this strange half-world, somewhere on the fringes of Carcosa. But she knew enough to realize that there was no leaving this building by the front door anymore.</p>\n<p>It was difficult. She was beginning to suspect that Millicent somehow didn't think like normal people...or maybe <em>people</em> in general.

They seemed endless, miles of corridors decorated in 1890s style, all threadbare silk wallpaper and sconces for gas lamps, faded photographs of men and women in old-fashioned clothes dotting the walls. They walked on and on, over staircases that they climbed and past ones they avoided, depending on Temperance's advice, but gradually they climbed higher and higher.</p>\n<p>They passed doors, locked, and doors, open. Some doors had been broken in, and some rooms didn't have doors at all; the rooms beyond were yawning abscesses in the building, full of dust and bricks and broken furniture.</p>\n<p>But other rooms were handsomely done in an elegant Art Deco style. When they were near those, they sometimes saw people dressed in evening clothes, quickly walking far down the corridors from them. Some wore masks as well.</p>\n<p>Now and again they would hear the sound of parties, or snatches of music. Once they heard the sound of gunfire. Temperance found a goldfish carved out of marble, with fantastically well done detail. She put it in her purse.</p>\n<p>Candace wandered into a beautifully decorated salon, full of books with bindings that looked at least 60 years old. They were all by her, all books she had never written. She found a faded, sepia-toned photograph of herself, dressed in turn of the century clothes. "The Authoress." said the caption.</p>\n<p><em>[2 points of Stability here.</em></p>\n<p><em>HP: Are we in Carcosa again?</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: Let's just say that you could take suburban rail to there from here.

She was dancing around alone in a ballroom. She was wearing a white gauze mask and whirling around, singing:</p>\n<p><em>Strange is the night when the black stars rise</em></p>\n<p><em>And strange moons circle in the skies</em></p>\n<p><em>But stranger still is</em></p>\n<p><em>Lost Carcosa</em></p>\n<p>Charleston backed away and closed the door behind him.</p>\n<p>Temperance felt something move in her purse. She opened it and a goldfish, a living...well, dying goldfish flopped out.</p>\n<p><em>[Aaaand 2 points of Stability.</em>]</p>\n<p>Sam heard the sound of lovemaking from behind a door, quite vigorous as it seemed. He shrugged; it didn't have anything to do with his mission. So he ignored it, just like he ignored the shrieks of terror that suddenly burst out.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Jimmy was paying attention to the people they would sometimes see at a distance. He noticed that they kept running into one person in particular: he was dressed in a business suit of 1920s vintage, with a camelhair overcoat draped over his shoulders. He wore a mean looking fedora and was carrying a beat-up leather book bag. He noticed Jimmy staring at him and lit up a cigar, grinning in a malicious way. Then he strode off.</p>\n<p><em>[Sense Trouble test here.]</em></p>\n<p>His attention was drawn by the figure, which is why he didn't see the door open next to Temperance and a skeletal figure tumble into the hallway. He grabbed Temperance. "No, no, don't hurt me!" he shrieked.</p>\n<p>"It's all right, we're not here to hurt you," she said in her most soothing voice. Still, it had an effect. He calmed down slightly and begged her for food.</p>\n<p>She shook out the last of the paper bag of trail mix she had been munching on (her father taught her long ago to never leave the house without iron rations, as he called them.) The man quickly ate up every crumb. Then he looked up. "You're not wearing masks," he said. "Oh my God. Are you real?"</p>\n<p>"Yes. What's your name?"</p>\n<p>"I'm Josh. I'm a TV repairman. I came to repair a TV and things got weird. I just stayed a little late and then I couldn't find my way out! What year is it?"</p>\n<p>"1956."</p>\n<p>"Oh no! I came here in 1955!"</p>\n<p>"It's just January," said Temperance. She took his hand. "Come with us. We're getting out of here."</p>\n<p>Josh explained that the only food he could find was stale champagne and leftover food from the parties that he heard from time to time. He had tried but he could never find a way out.</p>\n<p>"We will find it together," said Temperance. "God will provide!"</p>\n<p>"There is no God here!" wailed Josh.</p>\n<p>Jimmy smacked him. "Calm down," he growled, and slowly lowered his fist, shaking. <em>Don't give in</em>, he thought.</p>\n<p><em>[2 points of Stability lost, but there was a benefit...]</em></p>\n<p>He felt a dog licking his hand. He slowly lowered his gaze. "Betty?" he whispered. The dog howled, and he hugged it.</p>\n<p>"The dog is back," said Temperance. "Didn't the dog die? The dog died. I have a fish in my purse and a TV repairman, and now the dog is back. How can I see it?"</p>\n<p>Betty was howling and yelping joyfully. "I think I'm just going a little crazy," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"But how would that make me see the dog?" said Temperance. Jimmy ignored her and hugged Betty again. "I'm so sorry for what happened to you," he said to her.</p>\n<p>"That's all right, Jimmy," said Betty.</p>\n<p>Jimmy paused, straightened up, and walked down the hallway.</p>\n<p><em>[JP: I'm not waiting for you to ask, taking away 1-point of Stability.]</em></p>\n<p>"Candace, the dog is talking," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"We've seen some strange things," replied Candace placidly.</p>\n<p>"We have to leave here. We have to go through. Though I think that will bring us back to Carcosa."</p>\n<p>"Are we going to Carcosa, girl?" said Jimmy to Betty.</p>\n<p>"Woof."</p>\n<p>"Are you stuck there."</p>\n<p>"Woof?

Woof. Woof."</p>\n<p>"You're a sassy-pants," said Jimmy. "All the women in my life are sassy-pants."</p>\n<p>"I'm not sassy," said Temperance. "Why would you say I'm sassy?

After a long time, Jimmy realized that the man with the book bag was following them. He glanced back, and saw the man scurry away. This time he gave into temptation and pursued him, followed by Charleston.</p>\n<p>They followed him past several turnings of the corridors until they came face to face with the man. They recognized him: N. Quincy Lund. As they approached, the vicious wounds on his face and chest opened up. Jimmy recognized his handiwork from when he had met Lund in Carcosa.</p>\n<p>"Don't go to pieces on me," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"You're looking for the girl?\u201d said Quincy. \u201cYou won't find her. But I wish you luck."</p>\n<p>"Woof," barked Betty angrily.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Candace hadn't followed them. As she walked along the corridors, she heard the sound of furious typing. Curious, she followed it to its source: a narrow, overheated room like all the bad hotel rooms she had ever slept in, with peeling yellow wallpaper and a hissing radiator. Beyond the window was a vista of more rooms, more or less identical to this one.</p>\n<p>Seated at the typewriter was Amadou Lalin.</p>\n<p>"Amadou!" said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Who?"</p>\n<p>"Amadou?"</p>\n<p>"Amadou...Amadou...wait. I do know you..."</p>\n<p>"Candace."</p>\n<p>"Yes, we met at the conservatory. I have so much work to do on the screenplay. I'm the author...aren't I?"</p>\n<p>"I was wondering if you could maybe help me," she said. "As a friend."</p>\n<p>"Yes...we're friends...aren't we..."</p>\n<p>"I'm looking for a young woman named Millicent."</p>\n<p>"Oh," he said. "She's not really in the building anymore.

You were finally home."</p>\n<p>"So you don't remember everything from the night at the theater."</p>\n<p>"I remember everything from that night.'</p>\n<p>"I don't think you do," he said. She noticed that blood was soaking his clothes, covering his face. "That was <em>my</em> vision of Carcosa. You don't think you left of your own will, do you? Let me show you what I had to do so you could leave."</p>\n<p>He pulled open a desk drawer and took a pistol out of it, placed it to his temple, and blew his brains out. Blood splattered all over Candace; bits of flesh and bone struck against the wall paper. She felt sick and shocked.</p>\n<p><em>[3 points of Stability lost.]</em></p>\n<p>Amadou put the pistol down on the desk. "That refresh your memory, Candace?" he said in a hectoring tone. "You sure you remember everything that's been going on? You don't even remember...well. After all, you're His favorite now, aren't you?"</p>\n<p><em>[TP &amp; JP: Oooooooooooo...]</em></p>\n<p>"Excuse me?" she said.</p>\n<p>"You're his golden girl. He doesn't need me anymore.

You know that he can give it to you. Typing away at your little <em>book</em>. The real Art? You know he can give you the <em>real</em> Art. I had it once. And look where that got me!"</p>\n<p>He picked up the pistol again, pushed it against his temple, and pulled the trigger again.</p>\n<p>Candace lurched back in her chair, chalk-white.</p>\n<p>"I guess now you'll finally start using your head," he leered. "Or just give Him what He wants. Just give in. It's so much better when you're through. Maybe YOU'RE the one who is going to do it right."</p>\n<p>"Just point me in her direction," she cried.</p>\n<p>"If you follow your heart you'll find it, I guess. After all. He likes you.

"What happened?" said Temperance when she saw it was Candace.</p>\n<p>"He shot himself. Twice," Candace said faintly.</p>\n<p>"Wait a minute..." said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"What happened?" repeated Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Amadou. I found him. He was talking about...not remembering things...not knowing what was going on...then he shot himself. In the head. But he was still alive...and then he shot himself again..."</p>\n<p>Betty the dog walked up, put her paw on Candace's leg, and gave a reassuring woof.</p>\n<p>"I've been dealing with that," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Thank you!\u201d said Candace, stroking Betty\u2019s head. \u201cSomeone who understands."</p>\n<p>"Woof," said Betty.</p>\n<p>"This is what Alice felt like," said Temperance. "Where's the rabbit?"</p>\n<p>A white rabbit came bounding down the hallway.

A couple of men in tuxes were struggling with a man in an overcoat; behind them, a pretty blonde with a flapper's hairdo and a champagne colored evening gown cowered against the wall. But most surprising was that the man in the overcoat was wearing a weird mask: somewhat like a samurai mask, perhaps, except for the heavy filter equipment she saw around the mouth and nose\u2014Colonel Murphy had sold war surplus for a while, and she knew a gas mask when she saw it. The "eyes" of the mask were mirrored and glittered in the light from a nearby gas lamp. She raised her pistol at him.</p>\n<p>He looked up at her. "Guns can't stop me," he said in a voice that reverberated strangely from behind his mask.</p>\n<p>"Make me find out if that is true or not!" she said.</p>\n<p>"You will feel the wrath of the Penitent if you do not step back," the masked man said. "None can affect the Penitent. I inhabit your dreams." He took a few steps toward them. Until he saw Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"No! NO! You can't be!\u201d the 'Penitent' screamed. \u201cThe OTHER! No!" And unceremoniously he turned on one heel and ran.</p>\n<p>Jimmy shrugged. He walked over to the petrified woman in the evening gown. "I knew this place was strange but that was <em>too much</em>," she wailed.</p>\n<p>"What's your name?" he said.</p>\n<p>"Nellie. I'm here with my friends. We thought we would celebrate the first night of Prohibition by getting really tight."</p>\n<p>Temperance exchanged a glance with Jimmy. They retreated to the rest of the group and huddled up. "We need to take her with us," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Woof," said Betty. Temperance scowled. "No! You have to talk to be part of the huddle! Where's that rabbit anyway?"</p>\n<p>"We've been dragging around the TV repairman," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"He's only been gone a year," said Sam. "She's been gone too long."</p>\n<p>"She'll come back and be...what, fifty-six?" said Temperance. "Or twenty. Even better!" Sam shrugged, making a mental note to contact some of his friends in the government when they got back. She would be very <em>interesting</em>.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>They kept walking, working their way upward and upward. Each floor had a variety of rooms and people, but there was a <em>sameness</em> to them. Even Temperance's screaming match with a man who might have been Socrates had a certain ennui.</p>\n<p>They didn't know how long they had been there; their watches had stopped as soon as they entered the Green Room.</p>\n<p>Eventually they came to a floor that was a little different: it wasn't as nice. The wallpaper was duller, the lightbulbs dimmer, the decor of the rooms more obviously tawdry. They were passing down another endless corridor when a door opened at the end of the hall. A man stepped out, wearing a sleeveless white undershirt, suspenders hanging around. He walked over to a water cooler and poured himself a glass of water, then turned around and re-entered his room. The door slammed behind him. He hadn't seemed to notice them at all.</p>\n<p>As they approached his door, they could see a sign next to it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CASTAIGNE</p>\nNight Manager<br/></blockquote>\n<p>Temperance rapped on the door. "Hold on, hold on," came a voice from inside. He had a rather Yiddish accent. No, she reconsidered: it sounded something like that, but at the same time there was some <em>alien </em>quality to it.</p>\n<p>The door was pulled open from the inside. "Whaddaya want?" said the old man. "It's the middle of the night."</p>\n<p>"We need to get out."</p>\n<p>"Vat? Don't you have a lease? Come in, siddown. You want some tea?"</p>\n<p>"Yes," said Temperance. The room inside looked like any ordinary single-room occupancy in a big city: a cast iron bed frame with a sagging mattress, a rather worse-for-wear dresser with a shaving mirror propped up on it, a hot plate and a tarnished and blackened kettle. Nothing looked like it had been made after the 1930s.</p>\n<p>Mr. Castaigne put the kettle on the hotplate. "Ach, you can't get the good tea here," he said. "Not like it was in the old country, am I right? Whaddaya you know, you're not from the old country. Why am I talking to people like you for? Annoying! S'all right. You're a nice girl. Hey," he said, leveling a teaspoon in Betty's direction. "Who said you could bring that dog in here? It's a pest. I've been trying to get rid of it for years."</p>\n<p>"It's attached herself to him," said Temperance. "We'll take it with us when we leave."</p>\n<p>"It's my dog," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Your dog has been a nuisance. Chewing on things, leaving messes on the carpet. This is a nice hotel! You should do something with her. I had a dog that couldn't be trained, I put him down."</p>\n<p>"In the basement?" said Sam.</p>\n<p>"No. I put it down. You don't speak English? Always the same since I come to this country. Just sit down, sit down. You're not even tenants. You have an agreement to come in?" He poured them all a cup of tea in some cracked teacups. Temperance noticed a thick scrapbook on the nightstand next to his bed.</p>\n<p>"If nobody minds, I'm going to take a little pear brandy," said Mr. Castaigne. Temperance reached from the scrapbook and flipped through the pages.</p>\n<p>"Ach, that's from so long ago," said Mr. Castaigne. "Look, there's Momma." The pictures looked old fashioned: sepia-toned, and showing people wearing stiff celluloid collars or Edwardian ruffles and hats. There were also newspaper clippings.</p>\n<p>Those disturbed her. The headlines were from New York papers in the 1920s and said things like, "Russo-Germanic Pact Crumbles! Prague Liberated!"</p>\n<p>"Did you fight in the war?" she said as calmly as she could.</p>\n<p>"Oh, the war, that was terrible. Things were so bad. Now, I'm here, so things could be worse. I could be homeless. I spent a year working for the Superintendent, what a meshugge he is..."</p>\n<p>"He was polite to us."</p>\n<p>"If you met the Super, he would not have been so polite," Castaigne began, but then he caught Candace's eye. "Oh. I see. I understand. I like it here. I like my job. Tell him that."</p>\n<p>"Did a girl named Millicent come through here?"</p>\n<p>"Milly, ah, she was so nice," said Castaigne. "She went up to the roof. Not far from here, you take the stairs. But you need the key."</p>\n<p>"Who has the keys?" said Candace.</p>\n<p>"I do. But how do I know I'll get them back from you?"</p>\n<p>"If you're so worried, you could come with us," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"Oh, no. I don't like to go out on the roof. And if the Super finds out that people are going on the roof, without a lease..."</p>\n<p>"I paid for Millicent's lease," said Candace. "So it's mine now."</p>\n<p>"Did they give you a receipt?" said Castaigne. "Let me see it." He slipped on a pair of half-spectacles and read over the papers Candace handed him. Then he took out a pad of yellow paper and wrote out a receipt. He stamped it, and handed it with the other papers back to Candace. She looked at the seal he had put on the receipt: it writhed strangely in the dim light.</p>\n<p>The Yellow Sign.</p>\n<p>"I'm glad we took care of all that," said Castaigne.

After a while they seemed to ascend outside, somehow, with a vast darkling plain of thousands of rooms many hundreds of feet below them, all without ceilings, all spreading off into infinity, it seemed. Finally, they reached a door that blocked the staircase.</p>\n<p>"Well, I'm not one for ceremony," said Castaigne, unlocking the door and then backing down below them on the staircase. "It's been nice knowing all of you."</p>\n<p>"When did you come here?" asked Sam.</p>\n<p>"A long time ago. To be honest...it feels like I've always been here. Many years ago, I read a book. Called <em>The King in Yellow</em>. Caused me to end up in a mental institution. Had a little trouble with my cousin. There was a death involved. Fortunately, the Superintendent was willing to give me a job here. If you want, I could see if he had a place for you."</p>\n<p>"I think he knows me."</p>\n<p>"Yes. Yes, he does, Dr. Acererak. As for you, Mr. Chiu, you're no worse than waitlisted for this place."</p>\n<p>Jimmy pulled open the door. "Come on, girl," he said.</p>\n<p>Betty cowered at the threshold, whining. "You afraid to go out?" he said. She whimpered.</p>\n<p>He thought about picking her up. He gazed into her eyes, and noticed for the first time they were no longer the deep mahogany brown he had known for a decade. They had turned yellow.</p>\n<p>"Woof," said Betty, knowing that he understood.</p>\n<p>"It was good seeing you again," he said.</p>\n<p>"Woof. See you around, Jimmy," she said, and padded back down the stairs.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance stepped out onto the roof and stopped dead. "The...the...the stars..." she said. She felt her knees turning to water.</p>\n<p>All around her the cosmos was arrayed.</p>\n<p>Galaxies lazily unwound, trailing tendrils of stars; she could see the flashes of supernovae in their cores. Dust clouds blurred past, planets congealing out of them. It was impossible to take in at once. Her mind quailed. She was in awe.</p>\n<p><em>[And down 2 points of Stability.]</em></p>\n<p>The roof was made of obsidian, it seemed: perfectly reflective, glossy black, and smooth as glass. It gave all of them vertigo as they huddled together: they couldn't see where the roof ended but they knew the edge was out there <em>somewhere</em>, and beyond it that terrible void.</p>\n<p>As their eyes adjusted to the light, they saw doorways. They looked perfectly ordinary, if made of stone. Yellow light radiated dimly from them, but they couldn't see what was beyond the threshold.</p>\n<p>Sam handed Charleston his flask of "reality enhancer." Jimmy whistled slowly. "Amazing," he said softly.</p>\n<p><em>[Anyone with Astronomy only lost 1 point of Stability, because the sight was so cool. Sam and Charleston only saw the stars of an incredibly dark and clear night, but I ruled they were ineligible for making the Sense Trouble roll I called for at this point.]</em></p>\n<p>Temperance felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. She caught a glimpse of something\u2014a figure\u2014darting past one of the doorways. "There's something out there," she said. "Living. Sentient. The Night Manager was afraid of the Super..."</p>\n<p><em>[Sense Trouble; TP scored an additional benefit, which was "Safe".]</em></p>\n<p>"We need to find the right door," said Jimmy.</p>\n<p>"What doors?" said Charleston. "The doors are a lie! Wait! I sound like one of them now!"</p>\n<p>Jimmy peered into the darkness. He saw a double-star system flash briefly behind one of the doorways. It seemed strangely familiar. "That one!" he said, and lurched toward it, sliding and slipping across the slick floor. He held fast to Temperance's hand, and out of the corner of his eye he saw her forming a human chain with the rest of them. Something was moving toward them, he could feel it. The ground became covered with frost, which let him slip into an awkward but rapid bellyslide through the lintel...</p>\n<p><em>[Athletics test here, with everyone piggybacking and the NPCs not being very helpful. But they got a 16, which was actually enough to claim a benefit: JP went with "Fast".]</em></p>\n<p>...and he fell.</p>\n<p>He fell and fell, tumbling through empty space, shrieking as he hit terminal velocity.

There was a loud knocking somewhere nearby but she was ignoring it.</p>\n<p>The knocking became more insistent.</p>\n<p>She sat up and looked around in confusion. She was wearing a nightgown and sitting up in a small bed. There was a window nearby; the grey light of early morning was coming in around the edges of the windowshades. In the dimness she saw the vague outlines of what looked like a typical, if unfamiliar, studio apartment.</p>\n<p>The knocking was coming from the door. "Come on, little miss," said a voice behind the door. "Open up."</p>\n<p>She got up and opened the door a crack. Through it she saw a face that she recognized, although it was changed: twenty years older than she had ever seen it, for one thing, and not covered with the fine tracery of tattoos. But without a doubt, it was Charlie, the man from her dreams, her spirit guide. A man who had been dead for going on twenty years.</p>\n<p>He was wearing a uniform that was so dark a blue it looked black. She wasn't familiar with the cut or the insignia; they looked vaguely military, but civilianized somehow. A policeman's uniform, perhaps.</p>\n<p>"Aren't you ready? Didn't you get my call?" he said.</p>\n<p>"Charlie?" she said in a low voice.</p>\n<p>"Yes, it's Charlie, Detective. Aren't you going to get dressed? Get your uniform on!"</p>\n<p>"Charlie, what are you doing here?"</p>\n<p>He sighed, a familiar sound but one that send shocks down her spine, because she was <em>hearing</em> it, not with her mind's ear but in waking, living life. "I told you. We have a case."</p>\n<p>"I'll...be down in a minute?"</p>\n<p>"Please. Just get your uniform on, I'll be just outside. Oh, here." He passed her a paper cup of coffee. It looked startlingly familiar, the blue and white Grecian pattern of any New York City coffeeshop. Down to the cheery "New York's Best Coffee!" printed on one side.</p>\n<p>"Right. I'll get dressed and then we'll work the case...partner..." she said.</p>\n<p>"That's very nice, little miss, but I'm not your partner," he said through the door.</p>\n<p>"I always saw you that way."</p>\n<p>"Yeah, yeah. Come on, Major, let's go."</p>\n<p>She turned on the lights. On a chair, neatly folded, she saw a black uniform. It had a double-breasted tunic and jodhpurs. A pair of knee-high patent leather boots went with it, along with a peaked cap. She put them all on and then opened the door.</p>\n<p>"Hey, where's your armband?" said Charlie.</p>\n<p>She went back to the chair. There was a blue armband there, with a stylized eagle picked out in yellow in the center. Next to it were the initials RSA.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466672/#Comment_466672" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T18:00:10+00:00" title="September 29, 2017  6:00PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: Broken Night (Part 15)</b>\n<p>Charleston came to naked in a room. Early morning light shone in from a hole in the ceiling. What he could see of the room was a perfect match for the impromptu skylight: fallen plaster, dust, a mildewed couch: some abandoned building, then.</p>\n<p>Helen hove into view next to him, also naked. She looked around. "Did we...fall?"</p>\n<p>"I'm pretty sure we did," he said, standing up. He found a grey suit in a heap nearby. It seemed to be his size, so and he slid into it. Helen blinked and looked around. "Oh no," she said softly, and then much louder. "No!" She ran out the room and he could hear her descending a flight of stairs. From below, he heard her scream out "NO!" again. He gathered up her clothes and followed her.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the stairs he emerged into a vast ruined space that looked a little like a hotel lobby. "What's with all the noise?" he said. He tossed Helen's dress at her. She caught it and pulled it on, face red with anger and frustration. And fear.</p>\n<p>Outside he could see a public square with broad avenues radiating away from it; for a moment it reminded him of Paris, but the buildings nearby were skyscrapers that had never graced a Parisian roofline.</p>\n<p>And then he saw the arch. And he knew where he was, but he didn't know <em>how</em>.</p>\n<p>It was the arch in Washington Square. In New York City. He turned away from the entrance and looked above the ruins of what seemed to be a reception desk of some kind. Written in faded gilt letters was the legend, "SUICIDE CENTER."</p>\n<p>"Why are we back? Why are we back?" shouted Helen. "You're just a figment of my imagination! You're a drug hallucination! I feel sober! How is this possible?"</p>\n<p>"I don't know. Am I your conscience, like Jimminy Cricket? Because if I am, then you're <em>screwed</em>." He threw an arm over her and led her outside.</p>\n<p>Parked nearby was an enormous car that could only be a limousine, although he couldn't place the make of the car at all; it seemed to resemble cars from the 1930s or 40s, all chrome fairing and bulbous hood. A man in a uniform stood nearby. He coughed politely.</p>\n<p>"Party leader?" he said.</p>\n<p>"Just a moment," said Charleston. He pulled Helen aside. "What the hell is a suicide center?" he said, looking at the building. It looked like some kind of cross between a hotel and a theater.</p>\n<p>"People would go in there. There were machines up there. But it closed in 1923, and this feels like 1955. Or 1956, I guess." It certainly was cold enough to be New York in winter.</p>\n<p>There was a pin with a symbol he didn't recognize stamped on it in the lapel of his suit. The man in the uniform strode over to him, holding a warm wool overcoat out. He helped Charleston into it, and as he slipped his arms through the sleeves he noticed an armband tied around one of them; on it was a stylized eagle.</p>\n<p>"Symbol of America," he said in a low voice to Helen.</p>\n<p>"Of course!" she hissed back. "This is the USA."</p>\n<p>"What are we doing down here?"</p>\n<p>"I told you when I met you, I used to like to come down here and take pictures! Figment of my imagination, from a drug hallucination of some other Earth." She turned around in agitation, and then froze, staring through the gaping door of the Suicide Center at something on the ground inside.</p>\n<p>On the floor of the lobby was a beat up old Brownie camera.</p>\n<p>"Calm down, we were down here taking pictures. You passed out and had some weird dream. In the dream I wasn't a very stand-up guy but here I seem to have more...stature, right?"</p>\n<p>"You have a limo waiting for you," she sniffed.</p>\n<p>"Waiting for us, babe. You want to go get something to eat? What's wrong?"</p>\n<p>"You're wearing the armband of someone in the Inner Party. I didn't know you were so high up."</p>\n<p>"Me neither!"</p>\n<p>"I didn't know you were <em>in</em> the Party!"</p>\n<p>"Me neither!"</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Candace awoke with a start. Her head was resting on a desk. Stacks of papers covered everything her head didn't. She sat up. She was sitting in a very nice leather armchair. She picked up one of the sheets of paper. "Request for Information Cancellation," it said.</p>\n<p>She picked up another. "Speech outline to be given by Party Secretary," this one read. There was a tap at the door and a woman in a business suit stuck her head in. "Oh! Mrs. Heartbrooke! Did you sleep at your desk again?"</p>\n<p>"I must have," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"We seem to have a situation," said the woman. "We need you to come handle something, that's all they told me. Somebody from the government. But hush-hush. There's not going to be a 37-6 on this or anything. There's a car waiting downstairs."</p>\n<p>"What is it about?" said Candace, getting up and shrugging into a suit jacket she found hanging from a coat rack in one corner of the room.</p>\n<p>"I think it's about some muckity-muck who died," said the woman as they walked out of the office.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance sat in the back seat of a black car. She had tried to get into the front seat, next to Charlie, but he angrily forced her out of it. "Major, what's wrong with you?" he said. "Were you out drinking? You don't drink!"</p>\n<p>"No, I was just thinking about a case," she deflected.</p>\n<p>"If your father thought you were drinking, I'd really be in dutch," said Charlie. "The Admiral is an important man."</p>\n<p>"Of course, of course."</p>\n<p>"So the story is some bigwig got himself killed last night. Case looks really weird. We're supposed to go over there and cover everything up. Or find out who did it, I mean. At least, <em>somebody</em> who did it. His personal secretary is going to meet us at his place." Charlie flipped through his notebook, keeping considerably less than one eye on the road as they sailed through traffic lights, siren blaring. "Here it is. Some dame named Millicent Lowell.

She eyed Candace warily; she wasn't sure if this was <em>her</em> Candace, or some doppelganger.</p>\n<p>"You two know each other?" said Charlie. "From the admiral's dinners or something, right?"</p>\n<p>"Visit any new places lately?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Just here," said Candace evenly.</p>\n<p>"Say, what do you think of the Van Carlyle Trio?" said Temperance. "Think they've gotten better?"</p>\n<p>"I think they were good to begin with," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"True," said Temperance slowly. "Charlie, what do you think of them?"</p>\n<p>"The who?" said Charlie, making a sudden left turn.

It's hard to find nowadays," said Charlie.</p>\n<p>"Do me a favor," said Temperance. "There's a diner up ahead that I like. Pull up there."</p>\n<p>"I thought you said that place wasn't any good?" said Charlie.</p>\n<p>"I want comfort food, all right!"</p>\n<p>"Sure thing, Major," said Charlie. "Just remember we're supposed to be\u2014"</p>\n<p>"Guy's not going to get any deader," said Temperance. They screeched to a halt and she jumped out of the car, followed by Candace. They swept into the diner. It was a respectable enough New York coffee shop, padded swivel stools along a counter, wooden booths along the walls, the smell of burnt coffee and bacon frying.</p>\n<p>"Gimme a bagel," said Temperance to the counter guy.</p>\n<p>"Bagels?" he said. "We haven't had those in years. They only started letting, you know, those people back in a few years ago. I gotta buttered roll, Major."</p>\n<p>"Yeah, fine," said Temperance. "Candace, I have to powder my nose. Care to join me?"</p>\n<p>"What the heck is going on?" hissed Temperance once they were safely inside the Ladies'.</p>\n<p>"I don't know," said Candace, "but I think we're back in Carcosa."</p>\n<p>"Is this what drugs is like?" said Temperance wildly.</p>\n<p>"Only with certain kinds," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Who are you in this world?" said Temperance. "I seem to be a <em>Major</em>, people salute me..."</p>\n<p>"Something in the propaganda office, I think," said Candace. "Have you seen any of the others?"</p>\n<p>"Just Charlie," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Who's Charlie?" said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Oh, he was my mother's Dreamtime mentor. He's been mine ever since he died," said Temperance, unhelpfully. "It's all real, all on the up and up, but he doesn't remember anything. I have a theory..."</p>\n<p>"We're in Carcosa," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Nobody's wearing masks! I think we altered the timeline," said Temperance. "Superman <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2325&amp;Mode=like">#25</a>. He fell through a time portal that was made by Dr. T. O. Morrow. He caught the criminal, but it changed time."</p>\n<p>"All we were doing was following Millicent's trail," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Maybe Millicent's the one who changed time!" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Who cares!" said Candace. "Right now, the only thing that matters is finding everyone and finishing the mission."</p>\n<p><em>[Of course it was </em>Jimmy<em> who changed the timeline...]</em></p>\n<p>As she walked out of the restroom, the counterman passed her a roll wrapped in tinfoil. There was a radio on in the kitchen, and she could hear a newsreader droning "...the Premier of the USSR will be arriving in New York City to meet with the President in this historic first 'Summit Talks'..."</p>\n<p>"I can't believe they're letting those commies here," said the counterman.</p>\n<p>"Wasn't up to me to let 'em in," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"You're probably gonna be super busy, Major, with all them frogs running around," said the counterman.</p>\n<p>"You know it!" said Temperance. Silently she mouthed <em>help me</em> at Candace. Candace glanced at the calendar behind the cash register. It was open to February, 1956.</p>\n<p>"What the heck, Major!" said Charlie as they sat back down in the backseat. "You dames, always powdering your nose!

It was called the Avenue of the Heroes now. As they drove there, Temperance noted that huge boulevards had been cut diagonally through Manhattan, making large public squares. Most of the buildings had a sort of Georgian revival look to them, although the street plan was clearly meant to evoke Haussmanian Paris. Her familiar New York had been transformed into a gleaming city of marble and glass.</p>\n<p><em>[My extrapolation of what the world of "The Repairer of Reputations" would have looked like thirty years on.]</em></p>\n<p>They screeched to a stop in front of the mansion. "You're supposed to meet with his assistant, some gal named Millicent Lowell," said Charlie as they were shown inside by a clearly distraught maid.</p>\n<p>"Never heard of her," said Temperance, and they were let into the room that was the murder scene.</p>\n<p>It was a particularly macabre setting. Jimmy Wright\u2014looking somewhat younger and fitter\u2014was pinned to a mahogany column by a three foot long metal javelin. Standing next to him was a blonde woman in her thirties, looking completely unperturbed.</p>\n<p>"Well, it wasn't a suicide booth, I can tell you that," said Millicent Lowell.</p>\n<p>"Yeah, they been closed for like twenty years now," said Charlie. "Just those beatniks hanging out down in the one at Washington Square."</p>\n<p>"Miss Millicent, please come with us," said Temperance. "You'll be assisting with the investigation."</p>\n<p>"What can I do?" said Millicent.</p>\n<p>Temperance waited until Charlie had stepped out of the room. "What do you know about the Van Carlyles, and tell me the truth?"</p>\n<p>"The Van Carlyes? Like Carlyle Industries? Are they making cars now?" said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"You sure he's not related to the governor of California?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"I don't know any Carlyle governors," said Millicent. "Roger, you could call the paterfamilias. If he had a familias, that is."</p>\n<p>"Where did you meet Mr. Wright?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"He was a friend of my mother's, so all my life," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Did you ever go on any adventures?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"We had to file some papers at City Hall, that was adventurous," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Have you ever met a woman named Ruby Fitzgibbons?" asked Temperance.</p>\n<p>"You mean Mrs. Admiral Murphy? Yes. Aren't you related?" said Millicent. "She's kind of the hands behind the throne. Both of them."</p>\n<p>"How long have you worked for Mr. Wright?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"One way or another since about 1937," said Millicent. "He'd been acting a bit erratic...I mean, more than usual. Not the kind that would get a javelin in the chest. I mean, he was a wonderful man and philanthropist but he had his eccentricities. Nothing treasonous, of course. Just...eccentric."</p>\n<p>"He seemed to be a man of large personality," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"He did try to do the right thing," said Millicent. "I didn't intend the pun."</p>\n<p>"We haven't arrested people for puns since the 1940s," improvised Temperance. "Were you aware of Mr. Wright's recent trip to a city called...Carcosa?"</p>\n<p>"When did Mr. Wright go to this Carcosa?" said Millicent. "I could check his schedule..."</p>\n<p>"We have intel. We're not at liberty to say," began Temperance.</p>\n<p>"A few weeks ago," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Have you ever been there?" said Temperance. "Are you familiar with a play called <em>The King in Yellow</em>?"</p>\n<p>"Yes. It's pretty big here, you know," said Millicent. "Doing a musical revival on Broadway. Clark Gable is starring."</p>\n<p>"Second act is a doozy, comes out of nowhere," said Temperance. Without a word, Millicent went to the bar and poured Temperance a double.</p>\n<p>"Have you been a Major long, Major?" she asked.</p>\n<p>"As long as I can remember. I woke up this day and felt like a new person. A real <em>brightening dawn</em>."</p>\n<p><em>[The name of Ruby's plane.]</em></p>\n<p>"What were you before this morning?" said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"I was a member of an investigation into an individual that resides within Carcosa who has been deemed a threat. And a person from there that we're trying to find. She's gone missing, and we're worried about her safety," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"I think I heard of something about that," said Millicent. "Does she also go by Cassandra, or Cassie? I think she's used a lot of names."</p>\n<p>"Yes, people have secrets. Secrets within secrets...within secrets. She went missing after her performance in the <em>King in Yellow</em>."</p>\n<p>"I know an expert, a Mr. de Marigny," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"We met him in New Orleans," said Temperance. "He was helpful. We were hoping to find another person who had experience with these things. We were on her trail, actually." Temperance glanced at Jimmy's desk. He saw a picture of Beth Queen on it. "You know this woman?" she said, pointing.</p>\n<p>"Miss Auckland? She's an ace reporter. A friend of Mr. Wright's," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"I have one other question," said Temperance. "Are you aware of any projects related to time travel?"</p>\n<p>Millicent blanched faintly. "I know of some incidents a while back...but nothing recently, no."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471234/#Comment_471234" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-28T15:07:28+00:00" title="March 28, 2018  3:07PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: A Funeral in the Mirror (Part 3)</b>\n<p>At that moment a man in a bad government suit strode into the room. He flipped out a very official looking ID card. "Captain Kroeger, CSA," he said to Candace. "You the one they sent from the Department of Information? Right. Whatever happened to Mr. Wright we just gotta..." For the first time he saw Jimmy's body.</p>\n<p>"What the..." Kroeger \xa0swore. "So he dies in a car accident? How you gonna make something like that go away?"</p>\n<p>"Architectural accident," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Building was unstable," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Shoddy workmanship," continued Temperance.</p>\n<p>Kroeger shook his head. "I mean, we can get a guy in a car no problem, we'll identify him for you. I agreed to work with you Regionals, all right? But this is a matter of state security. I mean, the President and the Premier are going to meet at the Wright Foundation in a couple of days and now Jimmy Wright's dead? This could be the Froggies! I wouldn't put anything past those freaks."</p>\n<p>"I think for right now we'll just investigate. No one needs to know what happened," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"The Central Security Administration stands behind your investigation 100%," said Kroeger. "We will run whatever cover you need. Talk to my boss, Colonel Ballantine, he'll take care of you."</p>\n<p>Candace suggested that Millicent check Jimmy's appointment book. Strangely enough, he had cleared his entire week. Candace decided that the cover story would be that he was out of town.</p>\n<p>"All right," said Kroeger, "but we'll need a good excuse. The Premier of France is arriving and now Wright's not gonna be there to shake his hand! We don't need this, with the British situation spinning out of control, and the Chinese..."</p>\n<p>For the first time, Temperance noticed a political map hanging from the wall. She stared at it, fascinated. It looked very much like a map of Earth\u2014her Earth\u2014around the year 1900, before the wars and the breakups of the colonial empires. She noticed quite a bit of what had been French Africa was listed as "constituent republics" of the USSR\u2014the Union of Socialist Syndicalist Republics.</p>\n<p>Communist France.</p>\n<p><em>[I made a map for the game. The basics are just as described: the major European powers never broke up, and there was no World War I. The German-American war happened, of course, and in the course of the Revolution France fought and defeated a German-Russian coalition, leaving Germany and Central Europe contested between the rival blocs. So eerie echoes of our own Earth...]</em></p>\n<p>Kroeger broke her reverie in his snide way. "You know where to find me, Major. We think you Regies are fine. You do good work. Not everybody can do the glorious work of counterterrorism and subversive suppression. We need you doing the rest. Gotta have a Cripo in order to have a Stapo, right?"</p>\n<p>After Kroeger left they discussed what to do. Millicent sadly punctured Temperance's theory.</p>\n<p>"Are you familiar with the theory that the universe is just a simulation?" she asked Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Yes," she said. Very quickly.</p>\n<p><em>[Presumably she got that from her mother; in my </em>Eternal Lies<em> run the simulation hypothesis was a major plot point.]</em></p>\n<p>"Let's assume it's not for the moment. And assume that the universe casts shadows ... echoes ... that are real."</p>\n<p>"Ah, parallel dimensions," said Temperance. "Superman <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2337&amp;Mode=like">#37</a>."</p>\n<p>"We need to find out what happened to Mr. Wright," said Candace. "What was he doing before this?"</p>\n<p>"Well, what killed him was this statue of an American Indian," said Temperance, standing next to it. "It's made of lead, like the javelin, and I think the arm can move."</p>\n<p>Under an area rug they found a floorplate like a pedal or switch. When they cocked the statue's arm back and then pressed the plate, the arm shot forward\u2014it seemed to have some kind of clockwork on the inside. If the spear had been its hand, it would have hurled it, probably quite hard. Millicent ran through Jimmy's date books. A Meldrick Farnum was listed a few days prior; he worked for some kind of metal casting company.</p>\n<p>"What do we do with the body?" said Candace.</p>\n<p>"I can have the <em>boys</em> come by and take care of it, I guess..." said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"I can handle that," said Millicent, too deadpan to be mysterious.</p>\n<p>Candace knelt down beside Jimmy's body. "Sorry, Mr. Wright," she said, and went through his pockets. The only thing out of the ordinary was a tarot card, the Knight of Wands.</p>\n<p>"I have a tarot card too," said Temperance a little guiltily. "I found it in my wallet."</p>\n<p>"I do too," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"But why? Everyone knows that they're the devil's playground, but that's neither here nor there," said Temperance. "Millicent, what do you know about them?"</p>\n<p>"They eventually become the playing cards we know today. The major aracana got removed except for the Fool, which becomes the Joker. Why?" said Millicent, sweating a little. "Though I heard that there was somebody who gave out cards..."</p>\n<p>"Who?" said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Have you heard of the Penitent?" said Millicent. "All right. You might want to sit down. This room should be soundproofed, and I don't think we're being bugged by anyone. Except Mr. Wright. Who's dead. Which reality did you come from?"</p>\n<p>"You're <em>our</em> Millicent! From Earth One!" said Temperance. "JSA and JLA! She's from the JSA, but we're on the JLA world!"</p>\n<p><em>[Me: Points to Gryffindor.]</em></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment"

not make any assumptions!" said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"The one where Ruby has only one arm and Bradley Grey is governor of California," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Did you come from the McAllister Building?" said Candace. "Then we were following you."</p>\n<p>Millicent explained, in her usual breathless style, that in this world there was a...vigilante named the Penitent. He used to give out tarot cards to people\u2014a Knight meant you were under his protection, an Ace meant you were a target, and a card from the major arcana meant you were an ally.</p>\n<p>"I have a tarot card," said Candace, pulling it out. "The Tower. Major arcana."</p>\n<p>"Me too," said Temperance, displaying The Magician.</p>\n<p>"The only other thing you need to know is that the Penitent was...Mr. Wright," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"He was a vigilante on this world?" said Temperance. "As well, I mean."</p>\n<p>"Was he murdered, or was this a plan?" wondered Candace.</p>\n<p>"We sometimes talked about his business," admitted Millicent. "I was thinking we could hide his body in his secret lair."</p>\n<p>"Did you go on any adventures with him?" said Temperance. "Did you have an alias?"</p>\n<p>"Yes. No. The idea was nobody would ever see me," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Did you tell him where you were from?" said Candace.</p>\n<p>"No. But he could have found out that there wasn't a Millicent Lowell in this world," said Millicent. "Roger Carlyle is in this world, so I can't be."</p>\n<p><em>[See </em>The Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep<em> for the origin story of Vanessa and Mirabelle/Millicent.]</em></p>\n<p>"How are we here?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Well, there is a Major Murphy here," said Millicent. "But whether or not you swapped places or you're overriding her, I don't know..."</p>\n<p>"Now about this lair you spoke of," said Temperance, eyes gleaming.</p>\n<p>"It's just your average...vigilante...masked fighter for justice...lair," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"He is a millionaire here," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"You're right. Let's move the body to the lair," said Temperance, jumping up. "And talk to leads. This Betty Auckland. Does she know about Mr. Wright being the Penitent?"</p>\n<p>"I haven't told her," said Millicent. "But here she's pretty sharp. I guess on Earth One she wasn't always, but her she is."</p>\n<p>"On Earth One she is pretty sharp," said Temperance distractedly.</p>\n<p>"Oh right," said Millicent. "On Earth Zero, I meant." Temperance didn't seem to notice.</p>\n<p>"Candace, you talk to Betty," said Temperance. "You're good. Very good at talking. Very charismatic and wise. And I really, really think I would be better suited going to superhero lair. And taking care of things. I have more upper body strength."</p>\n<p>"You know, I thought you were scared, but now I think you're enjoying this," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"No, I am scared! Just yesterday I was in a very strange building, and now I'm in a comic book."</p>\n<p>"Temperance, listen. We need to find Jimmy. We need to find out what happened. Then we need to get home. This isn't play time," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Yes, but we all came through. Where's the real Jimmy? Maybe he's wandering around!"</p>\n<p>Millicent rang Betty up on the phone. "Hiya Millicent!" said Betty when she picked up in her familiar, brassy, New Yorker accent.</p>\n<p>"Listen, I got a propaganda specialist and a major here, so giving you a heads up..." began Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Oh, I thought you was calling about tonight," said Betty.</p>\n<p>"I hope tonight is still on, but I'm sending the propaganda lady to you. All I know is that Mr. Wright trusted them?"</p>\n<p>"Am I in trouble? This major with the RSA or CSA?"</p>\n<p>"RSA," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Oh, cops. No worries. Lissen, I'll see ya tonight," said Betty, and hung up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471270/#Comment_471270" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T03:14:37+00:00" title="March 30, 2018  3:14AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Millicent actually officially knows the deal with Vanessa, right.

to the offices of the New York <em>Mirror</em>, one of the city's most important dailies. She flipped through a copy of the morning's paper as she whisked through the unfamiliar yet all too familiar streets: the headlines were about the summit with the French, of course. She read over the masthead. Unusually, the paper's chief editor was a woman named Elisa Olney.</p>\n<p>"Call me Jax," said Olney when Candace arrived at her office. She was an older woman in a menswear suit that would have looked good on Marlene Dietrich, complete with a cigarette in a long black holder. "Everyone does. My girl says you want to talk to Betty Auckland. This an official matter?"</p>\n<p>"Not at all," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"This isn't about the Penitent, is it? We've been getting a lot of heat on that, but it's a significant story and we're going to keep on it, and Betty's my ace. I don't get you government types, you were high on the vigilante before but now you're down on him. Anyway, she's in the bullpen."</p>\n<p>Candace followed Olney's secretary out into an open space clotted with a thick fug of cigarette smoke and raucous with the sound of rapid typing. From a desk near a window she heard a piercing, nasal cry of "Copy!" She followed the sound to its source, a brassy blonde woman lighting a cigarette and flipping through some notes on her desk.</p>\n<p>"Miss Auckland? Hi," said Candace. She noticed that there were pictures of both Millicent and Jimmy on her desk. "I came to ask some questions\u2014"</p>\n<p>"This on the record?" said Betty.</p>\n<p>"No, not at all. I want to talk about Mr. Wright's assistant."</p>\n<p>"Millicent? She's a good kid."</p>\n<p>"Indeed," said Candace. "Let's go into the conference room."</p>\n<p>"Sure," said Betty. A look of confusion crossed her face. "I thought you said it wasn't official."</p>\n<p>"It isn't," said Candace as she guided her gently into the small, stuffy conference room. She hoped it wasn't bugged. "I have sad news for you. We really need you for your information and connection with Mr. Wright. I'm sorry to tell you that he's dead\u2014"</p>\n<p>"What?" said Betty. She collapsed into a chair and began to weep.</p>\n<p>"I'm sorry," said Candace. "I know it must be a shock\u2014"</p>\n<p>"I know, I know," sniffed Betty. "I mean, you can only carry a torch for a guy for so long, you know."</p>\n<p>"Since you were so close to him we figured you'd be an excellent resource to learn about him, who his friends were..." said Candace calmly.</p>\n<p>"He was a special guy," said Betty, wiping her eyes. "But he didn't have a lot of friends. I saw him the last time a couple of weeks ago. It said only open it in the event of his death, but I didn't think\u2014he had a lot of dangerous interests..."</p>\n<p>"Right now we can't tell anyone that he died, or how he died," continued Candace. "We were told by his assistant that we could trust you."</p>\n<p>"Millicent? Did she say how much I could trust you?" said Betty, said. Candace noticed that Betty was nonchalantly playing with something in her hand. A Tarot card. One of the Arcana.</p>\n<p><em>Cards on the table</em>, thought Candace, and took out her own card.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The Penitent's Sanctuary was underneath the Pitcairn House on the East Side, behind a door with a complex lock that Millicent expertly disarmed. "It shoots out poison gas if you do it wrong," she told Temperance.</p>\n<p>Beyond the door was a chilly chamber, about forty feet long. At one end was a metal grate; beyond it was a collapsed subway tunnel. There were bookshelves filled with reference books and directories. Hanging from wires on the ceiling were some trophies: a fake serpent, a paste replica of the Hope Diamond, a fortune telling machine with a mechanical swami, and several pieces of exotic weaponry.</p>\n<p>There were file cabinets in a line stretching down the center of the room. Most were blackened and warped by heat, and there was a distinct odor of smoke in the air.</p>\n<p>"This is new. This wasn't like this before," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"What happened? We have to investigate!" said Temperance with a mad gleam in her eye and a smile on her lips. "Could he have destroyed it? Was he expecting it? Could his nemeses done this?"</p>\n<p>"They would have to have found this place," said Millicent. "But there weren't any signs that anyone broke in, and he had a special way of doing the locks."</p>\n<p>"He must have destroyed them himself," said Temperance. "But why? Did he have an arch-rival?"</p>\n<p>"He usually made sure that his rivals didn't stay around long enough to become <em>arch</em>," said Millicent. "He did start changing his targets recently."</p>\n<p>"What did he start going after? Mobsters? Mutated Men from Mars?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"I don't know about Men from Mars, but he stopped chasing gangsters and petty criminals and started going after the government. Working with <em>subversive elements</em>," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Perhaps someone was on his trail," mused Temperance. "Someone who figured out who he was. Maybe they rigged his booby trap." She paced a little, and suddenly stopped. In one corner of the room there was a freestanding wardrobe, with a combination lock on it. Temperance stared hungrily at it until Millicent sighed and opened the lock.</p>\n<p>Inside were a trenchcoat, a slouch hat, dark slacks, a light chainmail vest, a glowering metal mask, and a pair of boots with three inch lifts.</p>\n<p>"The mask is really a gas mask," said Millicent. "And down the sleeves of the coat are these tubes, see? You press this button and it would blow this powder out. The drug had some kind of psychological effect on people..."</p>\n<p>"How do I look?" said Temperance, her voice muffled by the mask.</p>\n<p>"You couldn't pass for Mr. Wright," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Mummmmmble mmummmble the Pemmitntt," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"I'm not sure I follow," said Millicent. "Mr. Wright had to practice speaking clearly too."</p>\n<p>"Immf faard mu vreeethe im vis fimg," said Temperance. She pulled off the mask. "I'm going to keep this for safekeeping." She poked at the files. "I think he definitely destroyed these on his own."</p>\n<p><em>[Notice use by TP, who was enjoying this immensely.]</em></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471364/#Comment_471364" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-02T17:44:15+00:00" title="April  2, 2018  5:44PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: A Funeral in the Mirror (Part 6)</b>\n<p>The limousine whisked Charleston and Helen through downtown Manhattan. Charleston noticed that Chinatown seemed larger than he remembered it being. "Why do we need ethnic districts? We're all one people," he mused.</p>\n<p>"Yes, Party Leader," said the chauffeur. "But when we had that refugee crisis twenty years ago, a lot of people came here. You know, when they closed the Chinese border\u2014"</p>\n<p>"The past is the past," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"\u2014and detonated that atomic device over Hong Kong," continued the chauffeur.</p>\n<p>"...who could forget that?" said Charleston. He hoped he said it smoothly. "You make some excellent points. I should make sure the history curriculum is teaching things appropriately. If you could get me a third-grade history book..."</p>\n<p>"Sure, Party Leader, I'll pick up a copy of <em>My First Party Primer</em> when we get to the office," said the chauffeur.</p>\n<p><em>Not my first parallel world</em>, Charleston thought smugly, and settled back in his seat. Helen was quietly freaking out in the corner.</p>\n<p>"How are you in the real world?" she muttered.</p>\n<p>"You keep saying that, but the entire world interacts with me."</p>\n<p>"You're a big shot!" said Helen.</p>\n<p>"And you're with me, so that makes you a big shot too!"</p>\n<p>"I've been in your dream too long," she moaned. "I must be hallucinating. I've got it! I'm hallucinating being back in the real world!"</p>\n<p>"Whatever gets you through the day," said Charleston. He examined his surroundings closely. The windows of his car were made of bulletproof glass. <em>Perhaps my popularity isn't absolute</em>, he thought. He glanced back at the guys on motorcycles following him. <em>But I rate a security detail</em>. He looked at his reflection, and then looked at it again sharply.</p>\n<p>"My dear, do you have any tinted spectacles?" he said to Helen.</p>\n<p>"No, why should I?" she muttered.</p>\n<p>"Because if anyone notices these\u2014" he pointed at his eyes, which were still green\u2014"they might ask questions."</p>\n<p>"Just pull your hat down," she said.</p>\n<p>"At least I'll be fashionable," he groused.</p>\n<p>"Yeah, you make an excellent fascist. Look at your armband! You really think anyone is going to look <em>you</em> in the <em>eyes</em>?" She noticed his confusion and sighed. "It means you're a District Leader. You're in charge of the Party in a given region."</p>\n<p>"That doesn't sound impressive," he said. "Sounds like a store manager. How big is this district?"</p>\n<p>"Chinatown, I guess, so most of lower Manhattan. In New York City, which is practically the capital," she said.</p>\n<p>"Keep telling me how powerful I am," he leered.</p>\n<p>"I am not feeding this," she said. "This is my trip and I want it to be a good one. Allen taught me that."</p>\n<p>"I probably have important enemies," he said. "I'm not used to not knowing who my enemies are."</p>\n<p>"It's all intra-party politics," said Helen wearily. "I don't know your relationship with the Upper Party. I don't know your relationship with the President."</p>\n<p>"Wait, important people care about me here?"</p>\n<p>"There ain't but a couple of hundred District Leaders!"</p>\n<p>"A couple of hundred <em>now</em>," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>The District Headquarters had once been the Customs House, a grandiose mock-classical building that had heralded the new look of New York City.</p>\n<p><em>[It does kind of look like that. A lot of turn of the century NYC architecture makes this easier to extrapolate.]</em></p>\n<p>Inside was a bustling crowd of bureaucrats and functionaries, many of them young people. They greeted him respectfully as they walked by. "Good morning, Mr. Chiu."</p>\n<p>"Accompany me to my office," he told someone, who shrugged and led him to his elegantly appointed mahogany office. There was a large window where he could glare ominously down at the street below, and a large globe showing the empires of the world.</p>\n<p>He had barely settled down before the double doors opened and an efficient looking young woman bustled in, carrying a slender book and a sheaf of carbon paper. "Here's the book your driver asked us to get, and your messages. Party Leader Brophy wants to talk to you today. Here's your invitation to the Summit Dinner at the Wright Foundation in a couple of days..."</p>\n<p>Charleston spun the globe idly. "Ottoman Empire is still a thing, eh?" He noticed that there were markings on the globe in what should be colonies of the British Empire. On top of his desk was a memo concerning the status of the Dominion Wars.</p>\n<p>It seemed that a rebellion by the Indians and the Boers had led to an Empire-wide civil war. The memo noted that Great Britain was exerting tremendous pressure on the United States to intervene on their side, but that so far the US had not wanted to risk the possibility of conflict with the USSR...the French, he noted incredulously.</p>\n<p>Everything was complicated by the possession of nuclear weapons by all the great powers.</p>\n<p>He glanced up at the wall, where a picture of the President was hung. "Quincy Lund," he moaned.

It seemed, unsurprisingly, that the Party was deep into graft and corruption. He himself seemed to own a significant amount of property in Chinatown, including a nightclub.</p>\n<p>There was an angry memo from the local office of the CSA\u2014the Central Security Administration, according to his primer; they seemed to be in charge of counterterrorism and the suppression of communists, anarchists, and other threats to "democracy"\u2014to the effect that the vigilante called the Penitent was working with subversive elements instead of taking on the local gangsters, which had been approved of as a way of keeping up the pressure on them.</p>\n<p>"Says he can cloud the minds of men," muttered Charleston. "What a knock-off." He found a memo that said to destroy after reading. "The meeting with Mr. Han is set," was all it said.</p>\n<p>He chewed the paper meditatively. "I love this place," he said aloud.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Candace had convinced Betty to come with her to the Lair, following Millicent's instructions. "I only been here once," said Betty. "And he blindfolded me when I came. And then didn't even do nothing!"</p>\n<p>"Sorry," said Candace, waving at the place Millicent had said had an electric eye.</p>\n<p>"Me too." The door buzzed and rolled back, and they followed the stairs into the Lair. Betty gave Millicent a kiss on the cheek. "Well, we all knew this day might come someday," she said morosely. "I guess we gotta look at the letter he gave me." She pulled it out of her purse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>"Soon I will know if I am successful or lost but then again I will know. It is a paradox not unlike the looping swirl I now see before my eyes all the time. It is geometric, and yet it is not\u2026K would have known. Why does he no longer contact me? I can feel the wind now but it is on the other side of the earth and scorching\u2014</em></p>\n<em>"If I could have foreseen in advance what all this meant; if I could have turned aside from that first vision, when he spoke to me out of the eddies of time of other worlds, of other places\u2026if I had only turned aside, how many could I have spared? How many of those dear to me will suffer? I have seen their pain in so many places.

"How did he know\u2014"</p>\n<p>"Know what?" said Betty. She resumed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>"\u2014 <em>a gentler one I think, one I longed to journey to. She made me understand that my fears were only madness, and for a while I was content.

"Yes, he could see across time and space!"</p>\n<p>"I don't think this K is someone to talk to," said Betty.</p>\n<p>"Wait, how do you know Kakakatak?" said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"I met him in the basement of my mother's Foundation, years ago, when I was a kid. Nice guy for a tentacle-faced, lobster-clawed monster. He cut some non-loadbearing columns in half with his claws for me," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"I don't know about the drugs," said Millicent after a long pause. "But he was right about the parallel worlds theory."</p>\n<p>"You all have been smoking his stuff!" said Betty. "What did you get me into, Candace? Do you work for the government or not?"</p>\n<p>"She's not her!" said Temperance. "She's in on it too!"</p>\n<p>"Shut up!" said Candace. "I don't work for the government."</p>\n<p>"You guys are going to get me killed, or exiled to Arizona!" said Betty. "What happens if they find out I knew who the Penitent was? I don't wanna be interrogated by the CSA!"</p>\n<p>"This world is brutal," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"It's not like we're France, at least," said Betty.</p>\n<p>"Actually, where I'm from France is quite nice\u2014"</p>\n<p>"Well, here they're commies and they got nukes and don't like us so well."</p>\n<p>"We have that too," said Candace. "Except in our world it's the Russians."</p>\n<p>"The Russians?" said Betty. "But they're on our side."</p>\n<p>"Well, World War Two happened\u2014" began Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Wait, <em>world war</em>?"</p>\n<p>"Yes, the second one, before the nukes\u2014it's complicated. And not important. Millicent, you figured out how to get here, through the apartment. Can we get back that way? Or through that other Lair?"</p>\n<p>"I haven't been able to get back that way," said Millicent, "and this is the first I've heard of that Lair."</p>\n<p>"What other properties does he own?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"In this world?" said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Yes, in our world he doesn't own shit. A pair of shoes he stole."</p>\n<p>"Lots of stuff," said Millicent. "Vacation homes, factories. But it's really complicated, and he probably kept it off the books."</p>\n<p>"What about Lily? Is there a Lily in this world?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"What's a Lily?" said Betty. "A flower? Do flowers talk where you're from?"</p>\n<p>"Not usually," said Millicent. "She was a friend of Jimmy's. But she might not be <em>Lily</em> here. And I don't know what that would be, because I don't ask those questions. She was Chinese."</p>\n<p>"Jimmy did go to the 'Orient' a few years ago," said Betty. "Which was kinda dangerous. But he didn't know anybody from China. Nobody knows anyone from China nowadays, exceptin' those already here, like that backstabbin' party leader guy."</p>\n<p>"What's his name?" said Temperance, already groaning at the answer.</p>\n<p>"Chiu."</p>\n<p>"There was a professor," said Millicent, looking at the letter.</p>\n<p>"Guy named Homans," said Betty. "Works at the museum. And he had pilots to get him around to places, but not sure which ones."</p>\n<p>"Let's go talk to Homans," said Temperance. "And then get Charleston. No. Let's get Charleston first. I'm afraid of what he could do with a stamp."</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471465/#Comment_471465" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-06T05:04:17+00:00" title="April  6, 2018  5:04AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Temperance is quite right to be afraid of that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471561/#Comment_471561" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T15:22:06+00:00" title="April  9, 2018  3:22PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: A Funeral in the Mirror (Part 9)</b>\n<p>Thomas Two-Tone Brophy was the Party Leader for the West Side of Manhattan. According to Charleston's notes, he was one of the Old Comrades, from the first days of the Party, after the Chinese detonated their first atomic weapon and then closed their borders. It didn't really surprise him that he seemed to be one of the Old Comrades as well.</p>\n<p>"Five nuclear detonations in combat," said Charleston to Helen, as he waited for Brophy to be shown into his office. "And yet we're still here. Good thing you guys haven't invented jet power yet. I do like the four prongs on the plugs, though."</p>\n<p><em>[I had to improvise here as CP asked which detonations had happened. They were: the Hong Kong attack; a US detonation during one of the more despicable wars in South America (which is why Argentina was now two countries); a British demonstration in Africa during the Dominion Wars; a Japanese attack on the Dutch colonies; and a French attack on Dresden, which had been in rebellion.]</em></p>\n<p>"Charleston, you old bastard," said Brophy, striding into the room and seizing Charleston's hand. He was a shortish man in his 50s, with a pronounced Irish brogue.</p>\n<p>"Old and bastardy, that's me," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"You got your invite from our blessed Party Leader, N. Q. Lund," said Brophy.</p>\n<p>"Blessed indeed," said Charleston, fishing out a bottle of whisky from his desk. <em>Wow, I can afford this stuff</em>? he thought. He poured them each a shot and they tossed them off.</p>\n<p>"So I'm here to talk about our problem," said Brophy. "With all your boys comin' up from Mott Street and messin' with my territory. Gotta be yer boys, they're all Chinese fellas."</p>\n<p>"I'm telling you, it's a false flag," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"You keep sayin\u2019 that, but who else has Chinese people."</p>\n<p>"They might not be Chinese," said Charleston. "Could you tell? They might be Mongolian!"</p>\n<p>"I might," said Brophy, scowling.</p>\n<p>"Really? Because I couldn't," said Charleston. "We go way back. We didn't come this far to have petty squabbles."</p>\n<p>"Well, it's messing with me business, and we can't have that. Bad enough that we have that masked fella runnin' around. Seems drawn to those Chinese people."</p>\n<p>"Doesn't sound like a coincidence to me," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Ah, who knows what the Penitent wants," said Brophy. "It was better when he was taking out the mobsters. You saw the memo from the CSA?"</p>\n<p>"They have their ways of dealing with things, and we have ours," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"He'd probably be happier if we caught him," said Brophy. "We'd be gentler than them."</p>\n<p>"Would we, now?" said Charleston, flashing the grin that usually made people flee in terror.</p>\n<p>"That was a long time ago," said Brophy darkly. "We have our reputation to consider now."</p>\n<p>"I'll level with you. Them boys, if they're mine, I disown them.

Charleston gradually realized that he was being asked to turn off the recording devices. He frantically looked around his desk. Finally he opened up a drawer that had switches with locations marked on them: Front hall, back hall, liquor cabinet, desk...he flipped the one marked Desk and a flashing light came on: probably to remind him that the people who were bugging <em>him</em> might notice eventually that he was jamming their signal.</p>\n<p><em>[Surveillance test by CP.]</em></p>\n<p>"Who's this Mr. Han," said Brophy. "We caught one of these fellas and that was the only name we got. Whoever he is, he's got them more afraid of them than normal. Usually they give it up right away."</p>\n<p>Charleston paused, then pulled open a desk drawer. <em>If I were me, and I am, I'd keep my leatherbound book of all my enemies here</em>. Inside the drawer was a black, leatherbound book.</p>\n<p>"You still have that?" said Brophy, incredulously. \xa0"I would have thought it would have gotten lighter after all these years."</p>\n<p>"I keep the old parts to read before I go to bed every night," said Charleston distractedly. "There's no Mr. Han in here."</p>\n<p>"And of course you're being honest. We're old comrades, after all," said Brophy. "It would be terrible if you left me in the lurch."</p>\n<p>"No call for that. We've got a good thing going but now there's too many dice rolling. A new player, this Han, the Penitent has flipped on us...too many variables. Nothing is going to bring this down faster than a bunch of outsiders showing up, flipping over tables\u2014"</p>\n<p>The doors to the office burst open, and Temperance strode in, trailing a crowd of functionaries. Charleston's secretary managed to push her way to the front. "Major Murphy of the Regional Security Authority," she squeaked.</p>\n<p>"We have to discuss matters of internal security," said Temperance calmly.</p>\n<p>"Well, Chuckles, you got yourself in trouble with the Criminals," said Brophy. "I'll be talking to you later. Good on yeh, girlie," he said to Temperance as he passed by her. "Tell yer father to not be a stranger."</p>\n<p>After he was gone, Temperance said, "I want to ask you a question."</p>\n<p>"What the fuck have we gotten ourselves into now,\u201d said Charleston. \u201cYou seem to have done well for yourself. A major. A disciplinarian..."</p>\n<p>"Who's your favorite member of the Carlyle Trio," said Temperance, nonplussed.</p>\n<p>"Never heard of them," said Charleston with a wicked grin.</p>\n<p>Helen moaned. "Oh, great, another figment of my imagination. I like Bob Bricknell, the drummer."</p>\n<p>"So you're from Earth One," said Temperance to Charleston. "And this is Earth Two."</p>\n<p>"To me this is Earth One," muttered Helen, but nobody heard her.</p>\n<p>Temperance and Charleston discussed the Penitent. "I wonder which one he is," mused Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I don't think I'm at liberty to say, given that everything looks like its bugged," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Oh, that. Take a look. I can turn them on and off. See, here people <em>listen</em> to me," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"You're drunk with power, aren't you?"</p>\n<p>"Not just with power! Can I get you a drink?"</p>\n<p>"Sure," said Temperance. "It's my third of the day."</p>\n<p>"Why not? You're blue-collar now, <em>Major</em>."</p>\n<p>"How do we get back?" said Temperance after Charleston handed her a scotch and soda.</p>\n<p>"Do we want to?" he said.</p>\n<p>"Yes," she said adamantly. "I'm not interested in torturing people, and I want to go home."</p>\n<p>"Do you understand the ramifications of what is happening here?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Yes! We're in an alternate dimension!" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Stop making it about the world! It's about <em>us</em>!" said Charleston, biting down on the words.</p>\n<p>"We've been here for hours\u2014"</p>\n<p>"And it's been great!"</p>\n<p>"And I've already seen one dead body, of someone I cared about! And a superhero's lair! And I loved it! But we have to go back."</p>\n<p>"Wait," said Charleston. "So he was real? The Penitent?"</p>\n<p>"Yes! He was <em>Jimmy</em>," hissed Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Uh oh. Wait. He's an idiot! He's going to come here and try to kill me!" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I doubt it! We have his body frozen on ice."</p>\n<p>"Wait. You have a dead frozen Jimmy Wright."</p>\n<p>"With a lead javelin through his chest," said Temperance. "Thrown by a mechanical Indian."</p>\n<p>"As in Native American\u2014"</p>\n<p>"Yes, yes. That's the detail you worried about?"</p>\n<p>"This is compelling information," said Charleston. "The strong indication is that there is reason to believe that our doppelgangers...wait, we're in their territory...I guess we're the doppelgangers...what does Candace do?"</p>\n<p>"She still writes fiction," said Temperance. "But we have to find Jimmy's lair!"</p>\n<p>"If it's Jimmy's lair, it's just going to be full of self-recrimination and torture devices," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"No, we already found that lair," said Temperance. "There's a second lair. And that may be the one he used to get through to other dimensions!"</p>\n<p><em>[CP was on fire here.]</em></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471727/#Comment_471727" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-12T06:17:24+00:00" title="April 12, 2018  6:17AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He really was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471862/#Comment_471862" name="Item_211" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T17:01:50+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  5:01PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: A Funeral in the Mirror (Part 11)</b>\n<p>"Look, I have to stay here and go through my list of enemies," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Wait, are you going to just stay here and <em>do this guy's job</em>?" said Temperance incredulously.</p>\n<p>"No matter how this pans out, there's no benefit to me screwing up and losing power," said Charleston. "I need to maintain power. If we need resources, I'm the man to go to." If Temperance had been paying attention, she might have recognized the glint in his eyes.

They all closed?"</p>\n<p>"Yeah, they're all closed," said Helen.</p>\n<p>"It is pretty macabre," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Why did you need them in the first place?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I dunno, it was the Twenties, people were crazy, everything was going to hell..."</p>\n<p>"Why did you need a center to kill yourself?" said Charleston. "Hell, pop a window, we can all be dead in seconds."</p>\n<p>"Lots of people want to kill themselves," said Helen. "Why shouldn't you kill yourself if your life isn't going anywhere?"</p>\n<p>"Yeah, but why did you need a specific facility for something that should have been a straightforward operation?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"First, it ain't always so easy, and I'm speaking from experience here," said Helen, holding up her wrists. The lavender sashes she wore wrapped around the scars were livid in the office lights.</p>\n<p>"So this was...oh, they offered services. That wasn't suicide then, it was murder."</p>\n<p>"Assisted suicide," said Helen.</p>\n<p>"Never heard of anything so silly in my life," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I don't know, you're a Party Leader, aren't you people always saying that if you're surplus you might as well eliminate yourself?" said Helen.</p>\n<p>"You sure you want to stay in this world?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Listen, in the other world, what can you and I do, really?" said Charleston. "Here we have power. We can do what we want. You don't like lashing people to metal bed frames and electrocuting them? Fine. You don't have to do that anymore. You are a power here to make the world a better place."</p>\n<p>"I was perfectly content in the other world," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"That was then. After getting these responsibilities, these <em>capabilities</em>, you think you're going to be happy going back? Going to parties and being a prude? Gonna do that for the next sixty years and call that a satisfying life?" said Charleston, leaning forward in his chair and punctuating his words with angry jabs of his finger. "Embrace what has been <em>given</em> to you! This isn't about what I <em>want</em>! This isn't about how things <em>were</em> up to now! This is about what we're going to do from this point forward! You have been granted <em>authority</em>! It might be random, it might be by luck, it might be by destiny, it might even be religion if you believe in such a thing.

"Mrs. Heartbrooke, your husband is here to see you."</p>\n<p>"My...husband. Yes. Send him in..."</p>\n<p>Andy strode in. He was...he was...</p>\n<p>Handsome as she remembered him, yes: even here, even as a result of parallel evolution or whatever it was that guided these two worlds to be so close to each other, he had that twinkle in his pale blue eyes. His hair was longer than she'd ever seen it; when they had dated in high school he'd worn it short, and then kept it in a Marine buzz cut during the war. He was wearing a tweed jacket and carrying a leather book bag. A pair of reading glasses peeped out from his breast pocket.</p>\n<p>She watched him in silence, feeling the blood slowly drain from her face. Andy. <em>Andy</em>. Dead for more than a decade now, but here, living, breathing again. After the years of trying to move past his death, to put that pain and shock behind her, it took her breath away to see him now. It was beyond shock. It felt like a physical blow.</p>\n<p>"Hi, honey," he said distractedly, and slouched into a chair. "They cancelled classes for the rest of the day with all the political stuff going on. So I came down to see you."</p>\n<p>"Andrew," she said slowly. "Classes. Of course..."</p>\n<p>"You all right? You look like you've seen a ghost."</p>\n<p>"It's been a very strange day," she said.</p>\n<p>"You're telling me," he said, taking out a pipe. "What with the French in town."</p>\n<p>"Did we agree to meet?" she said. Something was bothering her; there was something wrong with Andy. She frowned slightly.</p>\n<p>"No, no, I called down before but they said you were doing something with the RSA. You in trouble?" he said.</p>\n<p>"No, no. You know my job," she said.</p>\n<p>"No I don't. We agreed on that."</p>\n<p>"It's just...government things...the summit...how are you doing?" she said, trailing off.</p>\n<p>"Fine. These kids, they have a lot of good ideas. I'm hoping we can get some of them into Jet Propulsion, and I want to make some recommendations to the grad school program."</p>\n<p>She nodded. <em>Physicist? He did want to study that, before the war</em>. She suddenly realized what it was about him that seemed wrong: he was older.</p>\n<p>She'd never gotten a chance to see him this age.</p>\n<p>Andy lit his pipe. "Read an interesting paper by some German refugee, Julius something."</p>\n<p><em>[Shout out to Dr. Orange, from the last campaign.]</em></p>\n<p>"Was there...did we plan..." she stuttered.</p>\n<p>"No, I wanted to surprise you," said Andy. "Was hoping to take you to lunch, but I guess it's too late now. You going to be home for dinner tonight, or are you working?"</p>\n<p>"I can try to," she said. "I have a few more things to work on...I should be home by seven. I'll head back then."</p>\n<p>Andy got up. "Oh, they arrested another bunch of kids at one of those crazy poetry readings. Some kid named Kerouac got thrown in jail. Real troublemaker. See you at home. I'll feed the dog, don't worry."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance had Charlie drive her up to the Metropolitan Museum, which seemed to be in the same place in this world as in hers. Small favors. She clutched her satchel, now stuffed with Jimmy's trenchcoat and iron mask to her chest, and kept clutching it as she was shown into Professor Homans' small office deep in the archives of the Museum.</p>\n<p>"Well, Major, I wasn't aware of any reason for such a charming representative of the RSA would come to meet me." He was sweating slightly. Her uniform seemed to have that effect on people.</p>\n<p>"I know," she said, ominously. "I'm not going to take you away. But I know."</p>\n<p>"Know what?" said Homans, hyperventilating. "It was just one time! I broke it off with the boy right away!" He stopped and looked at her quizzical expression. "You're not here about me and my graduate student?"</p>\n<p>"Every world I go to," muttered Temperance. "No. I know about the Penitent."</p>\n<p>"Yes, everybody knows about the Penitent..."</p>\n<p>"He died last night. Killed by a mechanical Indian with a lead spear."</p>\n<p>"What?" Homans paused. "Actually, that is sort of the thing I would have pictured him going out on."</p>\n<p>"Yes, it makes so much sense when you know Jimmy Wright," said Temperance quickly.</p>\n<p>"<em>Jimmy Wright</em> was the <em>Penitent</em>? Jimmy Wright's dead?"</p>\n<p>"Yes, and it's terrible and the city needs a new protector but that's not important right now," said Temperance. "I need to know where the Other Lair is. The second lair! The one he talked about in his letter to Betty! The reporter! What did you do for him?"</p>\n<p>"I used to run down things for him. Artifacts. He had...deals to get things," said Homans.</p>\n<p>"Are we talking about items of religious or occult significance?"</p>\n<p>"Well, I don't believe in such things. But he did. He...used to call me about ancient cultures. The last few times, he didn't sound well. Something about Pitcairn House was permeated by some force...I thought it was a tropical disease. And about Euclidean loopholes. The crazy thing is, when he was talking, it was like he was talking to himself, you understand? But one time...I thought I heard...I thought I heard his voice coming from somewhere else on the line, like somewhere else in the room."</p>\n<p>"When was this?"</p>\n<p>"Several weeks ago. He said he was working on something at the Watershed. I don't know what that meant. Look. Go talk to his pilot, Summers."</p>\n<p>"First name Joyce?"</p>\n<p>"Yes, actually."</p>\n<p>"Another doppelganger," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Another <em>what</em>?" said Homans.</p>\n<p>"Doppelganger."</p>\n<p>"What does ancient German legends have to do with this?"</p>\n<p>"I don't have time to explain. Where can I find this pilot?"</p>\n<p>"She has a helicopter down at the waterfront. Frankly, I'm surprised he was working with you. I thought all you cops wanted to arrest him." He slapped his hand over his mouth, suddenly conscious of saying too much. "I mean, I'm not political," he said weakly. "I took a trip to France in 1918. Before the Revolution."</p>\n<p>"There's more going on in the world than you realize," said Temperance, distracted.</p>\n<p>"'There's more under heaven than in all your philosophy'" quoted Homans.</p>\n<p>"You have Shakespeare here, then."</p>\n<p>"I'm going to pretend you didn't say that," said Homans. "After all, <em>there's nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.</em>" He poured Temperance a glass of water. She noticed that it had a faint yellow tinge.</p>\n<p>"Did you ever make anything for him? Or get him a machine?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"No. I do remember...he fought a man with a bit of a flair for the occult. Called himself the Blue Mist. He was making some kind of machine, and the Penitent captured it. Some kind of deadfall...no. It threw a javelin, I think," said Homans.</p>\n<p>"Its location probably remains unknown to this day," said Temperance quickly.</p>\n<p>"Well, the Penitent did always keep his cards close to his vest," said Homans. He casually flashed a Tarot card. Temperance flashed her back.</p>\n<p>"Is the Blue Mist around?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"No. He's dead."</p>\n<p>"Was there a body?"</p>\n<p>"Well, pieces of one. The Penitent pushed him off a building."</p>\n<p>"Sounds like Jimmy Wright."</p>\n<p>"Clearly you knew him better than I did," said Homans.</p>\n<p>"We have a complicated and interesting history," said Temperance, standing up.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472410/#Comment_472410" name="Item_214" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-19T06:58:50+00:00" title="April 19, 2018  6:58AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot about the Blue Mist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472826/#Comment_472826" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-24T19:06:11+00:00" title="April 24, 2018  7:06PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2018 7:06PM by Aviatrix.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: A Funeral in the Mirror (Part 13)</b><br/><br/>Charleston spent the early evening making a series of creepily cheerful requests to his staff, which had the desired intimidating effect: they quickly assembled a list of the off-book personnel he used in his\u2014well, the other Charleston's\u2014various graft and legbreaking operations.\n<p><em>[Intimidate spend by CP to find the people who would know if Brophy actually had any of his men.]</em></p>\n<p>He took a video call as the sun was setting from Colonel Ballantine of the CSA. \xa0He was a fiftyish man with the steely-eyed glare of secret policemen all around the world. "Chiu! what the hell are you doing?"</p>\n<p>"I was trying to decide if I was going to have scrambled or poached eggs..."</p>\n<p>"Why are you trying to track down these people?" said Ballantine. "I thought we all agreed there was going to be a complete separation. That we wouldn't talk about what's going on! So why are talking about it?"</p>\n<p>"Talking about what?"</p>\n<p>"Too late. Look, we're at a very vulnerable stage of this. You've been a good ally so far. And when we come into our own, you WILL be rewarded. We all know this. But what am I going to say to Mr. Han when he asks why you're FUCKING IT ALL UP?"</p>\n<p>"Tell him everything is fine. Say, 'Mr. Han, everything is going according to plan.' This what we all want."</p>\n<p>"Don't think I'll hesitate to take out Brophy. I don't care how old a Comrade he is. And if I gotta go that far...well, let's just say we'll have to cut our losses in certain areas."</p>\n<p>"Let's not make any hasty decisions," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Yeah, let's not," said Ballantine. "Clamp this down. Also, what the hell is with that RSA major you were talking to? Keep out of this case! Central Security is handling it. I'm doing my job. Your job is to make sure everything goes right at the Foundation when the President is there."</p>\n<p>"That's my job, all right," said Charleston, verbally tap-dancing. "They said we need somebody who specializes in things not going wrong and they said Charleston is the man for this kind of responsibility...thank you very much for the call, it's been educational." He hung up quickly.</p>\n<p>"Where's Temperance," he muttered to himself. "I think she's right. Time to go. Power isn't what it's cracked up to be. I'm a simple, real American."</p>\n<p>He pulled one of the asset books his staff had left for him. It showed he was a millionaire several times over. Most of it was sunk into apartment buildings. He noted he was collecting protection money from lots of nightclubs, many of them gay. <em>Who am I here</em>? he wondered. He got up and went into his executive bathroom.</p>\n<p>It wasn't what he was used to; for one thing, it lacked the shattered mirrors, blood in the sink, and general air of disrepair and slovenliness that was typical of the places he lived. The bright chrome furnishings were annoyingly cheery. He yanked open the medicine cabinet and found several shelves full of happy times stuff. <em>That much hasn't changed</em>, he thought, and grinned.</p>\n<p>When he closed the cabinet, his reflection caught his eye. Mostly because it wasn't reflecting what he was doing. Instead, his face glared out of the mirror full of malevolence. It raised a fist and began banging on the glass. He staggered back from the thudding sound it made.</p>\n<p><em>[2 point Stability loss.]</em></p>\n<p>His face began to scream, soundlessly, at him.</p>\n<p>He pointed one at the mirror, and laughed. He could just make out an obscured figure walking up behind his reflection. There was a flash of yellow from its cloak...</p>\n<p>He slipped out of the bathroom, slammed the door, and slumped against it, wiping away his tears. He grabbed a bottle from the bar and slammed down a shot. Then he called for his driver. He owned a club downtown. According to his notes, it was arranged around some fantasy theme.</p>\n<p>But when arrived, he recognized the theme immediately: what on his world would be called Roaring Twenties style. This didn't surprise <em>him</em>; the Roaring Twenties, the decade of his youth, was his favorite period.</p>\n<p>But on this Earth\u2014Tellus, he had taken to calling it\u2014the Roaring Twenties had <em>never happened</em>. (Their Twenties was the decade of a European war and the Second French Revolution.) So...just how the hell had his doppelganger come up with the idea?</p>\n<p>He shrugged as an obsequious ma\xeetre d' ran up to him. "Mr. Chiu! How wonderful to have you back!"</p>\n<p>"Yes it is," he snapped. "Get me something to eat. A nice hot cup of coffee. And I want to see every reflective surface in this club."</p>\n<p>"There are a lot of things like that in the club," stammered the ma\xeetre d'.</p>\n<p>"Why do you think I need a Sherpa?" he growled. They began a slow tour of every mirror in the building. He spent time looking in each, tapping on the glass. "You! What do you see in there?"</p>\n<p>"A very handsome man?" said the ma\xeetre d'.</p>\n<p>"Why, <em>thank you</em>." He stepped away. "Now look. What do you see?"</p>\n<p>"Me?"</p>\n<p>"Good. Let's keep it that way. Now, go check anything that reflects that isn't a mirror. Then give me a report, good and bad, before the evening is over." Charleston stalked into his private room and slumped into a banquette. They brought him a hot sandwich and some strong coffee.</p>\n<p><em>[MP, as a waiter: He's practicing his etiquette, for when he meets the Premier!</em></p>\n<p><em>CP: We better be out of here long before that or this thing is going to really blow up.</em></p>\n<p><em>TP: You don't say.]</em></p>\n<p>After he was done eating, he walked into the main ballroom and watched the band rehearsing, idly sipping his coffee. He looked down for a second and saw his reflection in the coffee.</p>\n<p>He slammed the cup against the wall. Everyone stopped what they were doing.</p>\n<p>"Oh that was hot," he muttered. "Carry on." He walked into the bathroom, hung his coat over the mirror, and washed his hands.</p>\n<p><em>[CP was on fire, again.]</em></p>\n<p>"This Charleston's gotta have sorcery books. Maybe at home! Wait, where do I live?" he said to himself. "I can't wander around talking to myself, people will think I'm crazy! I guess I can just ask my driver."</p>\n<p>He walked out and summoned the ma\xeetre d'. "I need you guys to get the spotlight on the marquee pointed up at the sky and make a Mobius Strip."</p>\n<p>"A figure eight? Sure, Mr. Chiu.

She sat up and pressed her face against the glass.</p>\n<p>"Anything wrong, Little Miss?" said Charlie from the driver's seat.</p>\n<p>"No. Wait. How long have you called me Little Miss?" she said.</p>\n<p>"All your life, Little Miss. Ever since your father rescued me from that attack by the Japanese."</p>\n<p>"Quick question. I've been having strange dreams. What do you think?"</p>\n<p>"It's been so long," said Charlie. "My people, we knew how to interpret dreams...but I've been here for a long time."</p>\n<p>"Kind of atrophied, eh?"</p>\n<p>"That, and all the matriarchs of my people were killed by the Japanese."</p>\n<p><em>Still a smart ass in this world</em>, thought Temperance. They pulled up to a heliport on the Hudson River. She stepped outside and walked down to a helipad.</p>\n<p>A short, wiry, middle-aged woman was working on the engine of a helicopter. "You sonofgun...goddamnit!" said the woman as Temperance approached. "Move, goddamn you!" The woman began smacking something with a wrench.</p>\n<p>"You Joyce Summers?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>Joyce turned, and then staggered back.</p>\n<p>"You're not in trouble," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"I'm paid up, you know," said Joyce. "How can I help you, Major?"</p>\n<p>"A mutual friend of ours is in a bit of trouble," said Temperance. She flashed her Tarot card.</p>\n<p>"Jesus Christ," sighed Joyce.</p>\n<p>"I need to know if you know where the water shed is," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Been a while since I saw the Penitent," said Joyce, putting away her tools. "Last time, all we did was fly out to Long Island. Didn't land anywhere, just kept circling in the air." She reached into the cockpit of the helicopter and pulled out a map. "Brookhaven, mostly. I think there was a laboratory out there. That's where the Mandarin Project was researched. Guess it was contaminated, at least since 1937."</p>\n<p>"That would be the perfect place," said Temperance excitedly. "It was all underground, wasn't it?"</p>\n<p>"I don't know anything about that," said Joyce. "Nobody knows anything about that."</p>\n<p>"But the Manhattan Project\u2014"</p>\n<p>"\u2014the <em>what</em>?"</p>\n<p>"\u2014don't ask. Government secret. But they built the Manhattan Project underground in subway tunnels. So they did the same here. What did he say?"</p>\n<p><em>[Growing up on Long Island, we knew there was a lot of secret and maybe unsavory things going on at Brookhaven\u2014they had their own nuclear reactor (which leaked) and of course there was also Plum Island for germ warfare research. So it seemed natural to use it for this scenario.]</em></p>\n<p>"All kinds of crazy stuff. You know the Penitent! He was saying things like, the thing that was attacking him was attacking more often. And that he thought it was a ghost at first but now he realized it wasn't."</p>\n<p>"Could it be the Blue Mist?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Wow, that takes me back," said Joyce. "Funny story. I flew him up on top of that building. He rappelled out of my helicopter."</p>\n<p>"How far is out to Brookhaven? About sixty miles, right? Good. Where's the closest costume shop?"</p>\n<p>"The only one I know is frequented by, uh, female illusionists, and I don't think they'd have what you want," said Joyce.</p>\n<p>"What...magicians?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Of a kind. They are good at making some things disappear."</p>\n<p>"Like buildings?"</p>\n<p>"Depends on the person."</p>\n<p>"Not important. You never saw me."</p>\n<p>"I wish," said Joyce.</p>\n<p>"Thank you Joyce. You've been very helpful. I'll tell your doppelganger if I see her."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>On her car phone, Temperance called the precinct and had them connect her to Candace's house.</p>\n<p>"Good evening," said a pleasant baritone voice. "Dr. Andrew Heartbrooke speaking."</p>\n<p>"<em>Andrew</em>? Good to hear you're in good health. This is Major Murphy. I need to speak to your wife on a matter of national security."</p>\n<p>"Honey?" said Andy, cupping his hand over the phone, "The police are calling?"</p>\n<p>Candace took the phone. "Temperance?"</p>\n<p>"I need you to do something for me," said Temperance. "Listen. Follow the Mobius Strip. Don't tell anyone else." She hung up before Candace could say anything then she had the precinct ring Millicent's apartment.</p>\n<p>Betty answered, in her familiar brassy accent. "Major Murphy?

It was one of her regular haunts; not that she had ever met the owner. When Temperance arrived she wasn't surprised that the two of them were sitting next to each other at the bar, blissfully unaware of each other.</p>\n<p>"I found it," said Temperance. "The way home."</p>\n<p>"You sure?" said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Hey," said Charleston. "Private conversation."</p>\n<p>"That's Millicent," said Temperance. "Millicent, this is Charleston."</p>\n<p>"Ah, the subject of our great pursuit," said Charleston, laying it on thick. He ordered a private table for themselves.</p>\n<p>"This place bugged?" asked Temperance as she sat down.</p>\n<p>"Of course," said Charleston. "And not just by me. Why do you think I have an eight piece band in this room? Okay, boys, let 'em hear you in heaven."</p>\n<p>The bandleader nodded. "Sweet Georgia Brown on four. A-one, a-two, one, two, three..."</p>\n<p>"I like this place," said Millicent. "It reminds me of home."</p>\n<p>"Brookhaven," said Temperance. "Site of the Mandarin Project. The same as the Manhattan Project back home. It's all underground."</p>\n<p>"I have the correspondences," said Millicent, pulling a large sheaf of notes out of her purse. "See, here's where the first bomb was dropped in our world, and here in this world..."</p>\n<p>"I could have made use of that technique over the last several years," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"Jimmy went out to Brookhaven with the Aviatrix a while ago. His sidekick," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Miss Summers," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"We don't have to fly, though," said Charleston. "We can drive."</p>\n<p>"Sure, we're government," said Temperance. "But we need to get everyone back together. Where's Helen? She said she was going to a horse."</p>\n<p>"I think I know where to find her," sighed Millicent.</p>\n<p><em>[It was a Streetwise spend before her next scene.]</em></p>\n<p>"And where's Candace?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Candace was at home. Whatever the hell it was that Temperance wanted her to do, it wasn't as important as having dinner with her husband.</p>\n<p>It was bittersweet, she thought, taking the last swallow of a glass of white wine. He was very different than the man she remembered. Beyond being older...it was seeing his potential realized. And of course it was different than what she had imagined; after all, <em>she</em> was different than anything they had imagined together.</p>\n<p>But he was still Andy. She still could nestle in his arms and feel safe the way she hadn't in years.</p>\n<p>They tried to make love after dinner. It was...awkward. Had it always been so awkward? They had just been kids when they got married, after all. And now she was far, far more experienced and confident.</p>\n<p>But, too, he wasn't as awkward either; it made things uncomfortable, like being with a stranger that one knew too well for the comfort of anonymity but not well enough for the comfort of intimacy. It wasn't until she drank some water that she felt a change. As she rolled over Andy, she felt a pair of hands on her shoulders, warm against her naked flesh. This was stronger than she had ever felt the <em>presence</em> before; it seemed all around her, like something invisible yet immanent.</p>\n<p>"Is everything all right?" asked Andy afterwards.</p>\n<p>"It's just...all this...it's work," said Candace. "I've just been exposed to so many things. I feel disconnected from reality."</p>\n<p>"Could we talk...about having children again?" said Andy.</p>\n<p>"Well..." she trailed off. She couldn't think of anything to say.</p>\n<p>"We agreed that we wouldn't have children but things are different now."</p>\n<p>"I'm...not sure that the time is right. Everything is so crazy now...I should probably head back to the office," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"I won't wait up for you," Andy said.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Millicent found Helen down in Washington Square, slumped next to the abandoned Suicide Center. Millicent sat next to her. "Mr. Chiu says he has a way to get us all home. Want to come?"</p>\n<p>"I thought I was home," said Helen bitterly.</p>\n<p>"If you want to stay, I won't force you, but if you want to come back with us, we'll take you."</p>\n<p>"All right, I'll come," said Helen. "This world seems just as crazy as yours. Although four prongs on plugs, that just makes more sense."</p>\n<p>"I agree," said Millicent. "That's one of the things I like about here."</p>\n<p>She helped Helen over to Charleston's limo. Candace was in the back, having been picked up just outside her apartment. She wasn't crying. No, not at all.</p>\n<p>"This car is a Tucker!" said Temperance from behind the wheel. "Look, it has three headlights! Seems that Tucker is a huge company here!"</p>\n<p>"He did better before starting Tuckerland," muttered Charleston. "On the other hand, Howard Hughes actually made the Spruce Goose work here. I think it's why they don't have jets yet."</p>\n<p>"Brookhaven?" said Candace. She flipped through her notes. "The Wright Foundation <em>owns</em> it. Bought it from the government, although they haven't finished decommissioning it yet. Seems he wants to build some kind of education center there, maybe a facility for rehabilitating prisoners."</p>\n<p><em>[HP made a Research spend earlier, and here is where it paid off.]</em></p>\n<p>"So this Jimmy believes in second chances," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"It's still technically off limits to the public," said Candace. "Of course, we're not the public."</p>\n<p>The drive took about ninety minutes, much of it spent navigating the dark farmlands of Long Island. Eventually they found the road to the main gate. There was a guard post.</p>\n<p>A tired looking guard staggered over to the car. "This is a secure facility," he began in a bored voice. He noticed Temperance's uniform. "Good morning, Major. We...weren't told you were coming..." He shuffled through some papers on his clipboard.</p>\n<p>"You're fine. We're here to look for some old records at the facility," said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"Thought they moved all that," said the guard. "But I don't know what they keep up there."</p>\n<p>"Mr. Wright's secretary said they were here, and it's all part of the deal he has with the government."</p>\n<p>"You'll need to fill out a RU-286 form," said the guard. "C'mon, I'll give you a cup of coffee."</p>\n<p>A little rain fell while the rest of them waited in the car. Candace noticed again how responsive people in this world were to authority. She suspected they could have so few guards here because most people would have turned around as soon as they saw the No Trespassing signs.</p>\n<p><em>[Psychology nabbed this clue.

They got out to search on foot with flashlights, looking for anything that made sense as a "water shed."</p>\n<p>It was Millicent who found it: a little shed near one of the Quonset huts (well, they looked like Quonset huts at least) with a faded sign hanging from the door: Danger\u2014Heavy Water Storage.</p>\n<p><em>[Notice spend.]</em></p>\n<p>"The water shed," cooed Temperance. "We found it. Kind of small, isn't it?" She smashed the lock off with a crowbar and they shuffled inside. The walls were covered with various tools\u2014pliers and tongs, mostly; there were some rusted cans or barrels stacked in a corner. Temperance frowned, and turned around slowly, "Aha!" She reached behind a workbench and threw a switch.</p>\n<p>The entire floor began to sink.</p>\n<p>"This is Mr. Wright's kind of thing, yes," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"This is what I wanted," groused Charleston. "What kind of Party Leader am I if I don't even have a decent hidden lair?"</p>\n<p>They descended perhaps fifty feet. Temperance slid back a grating. Beyond was a fairly large chamber, dimly illuminated by sickly fluorescent lights. All along one wall was machinery and electronics of some kind.</p>\n<p>"There's a lot of power running through here," said Millicent. "A <em>lot</em> of juice."</p>\n<p><em>[Physics got this clue.]</em></p>\n<p>Somebody moved out in the dim space of the chamber. A figure turned around and stepped forward a bit into the light. He was wearing a lab coat, a sickly looking man who might have been handsome once.</p>\n<p>"Dr. Schicksal?" whispered Candace.</p>\n<p>"Did the Penitent send you?" asked Percival Schicksal. "Good. I saw your uniform...thought the game was up."</p>\n<p>"Don't worry, I shouldn't need it much longer," said Temperance. "We're here about your machine. Does it work?"</p>\n<p>"Of course it works," said Percival. "At least that's what the Penitent told me. It was supposed to send him to other worlds. Obviously it only works for him. He was a little strange. His psychic frequencies vibrated in a way that the machine could use. It wouldn't work for me."</p>\n<p>"Let me see what I can do," said Millicent. "I know Mr. Wright wouldn't like me to break space and time..."</p>\n<p>She spent some time studying the equipment against the wall. "I'm not...sure <em>I</em> should be messing with this," she said finally. "And this tech isn't of human origin. It's Yithian."</p>\n<p><em>[Cthulhu Mythos was the ability here.]</em></p>\n<p>"The Penitent used to talk about someone called K," said Schicksal. "I just figured it was some malicious god who lived in his head."</p>\n<p>"Something like that," said Temperance. "Just not in his head. Very nice to children."</p>\n<p>"What was the Penitent doing?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"He came to me saying he'd seen all these visions of other worlds," said Schicksal. "He's been taking the Compound Liao powder. But then he said he'd stopped, since it made him crazy. I always thought these things were hallucinations. But about six months ago he had a frightening experience that convinced him they were true. And <em>that's</em> when he started giving me all these plans and diagrams.

"Oh good Lord," she said.</p>\n<p>All around them was a gallery of dead men. Some in glass cases, others laid on slabs. And they were all Jimmy Wright.</p>\n<p>She turned around slowly. They all had some kind of strange catalog number on a little cardboard tag attached to them. Some were rich-looking. Some were decrepit. Some seemed older or younger than the Jimmy she knew.

I guess nobody will be using the portal. He was able to cross worlds and bring these guys back, because they all vibrated on the same frequency. Not the one you and I vibrate on, of course."</p>\n<p>He pulled a strange looking device out of one pocket of his lab coat. It was just small enough to fit in his hand, covered with switches and inscrutable dials. Two arms or antennae flanked the boxy main section. He waved it in the air near him. Nothing seemed to happen. Then he waved it over the nearest corpse. The arms swung up and lights flashed.</p>\n<p>"See?" he said. "I don't register, but they all do." He waved it at Temperance. "And neither do you\u2014"</p>\n<p>The arms swung up.</p>\n<p>"What the fuck," he said. "Oh\u2014wait. Oh\u2014wait.

"Let me lay some groundwork, in case these Central Security goons get wind."</p>\n<p>"If anyone gives you trouble\u2014" began Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Kill them.

In other words, she acted like a writer. At home, it was a bit harder; Andy insisted on watching the Tucker Automotive Family Hour (this week was Davy Crockett) and talking about how nice it would be to have a little Andrew around. Candace picked a fight with him to put him off.</p>\n<p><em>[Psychology spend by CP.]</em></p>\n<p>Temperance pulled out her rolodex and moved around the higher levels of the security apparatus, making sure everyone knew that she had gone out to Brookhaven following up leads on Mr. Wright's murder. If she also happened to remind them that she was the daughter of an Admiral and the former Secretary of the Navy (?!) that was more or less by design. It must have worked; messages from both her father and mother began to pile up on her desk.</p>\n<p><em>[High Society spend by TP.]</em></p>\n<p>Charleston ended up killing someone.</p>\n<p>He'd panicked.

If she noticed him washing his hands obsessively she didn't say anything.</p>\n<p>"What are you going to do, Charleston?" he muttered to the mirror as the cold water fell from the tap on his rough, chapped skin. "You said you weren't this guy anymore, you weren't going to do this...one day you'll fall into one of these worlds and <em>She'll </em>be staring at you. You gonna kill her again? That who you are?" He glanced up and saw his reflection. "You did this!" he yelled.

He was wearing the dress uniform of an admiral in the U.S. Navy.</p>\n<p>"Temperance!" bellowed her father. "You're not answering my calls! Your mother's worried!"</p>\n<p>Blood turning to ice in her veins, Temperance noticed a woman with mostly red hair and several empty shot glasses in front of her sitting at the bar. She gulped.</p>\n<p>"When are you going to leave this police thing?" said Admiral Murphy. "You're not a detective."</p>\n<p>"I am a detective\u2014" she started.</p>\n<p>He grabbed her by the ear and dragged her behind some drapery. "You know what you are," he hissed. "Nothing but an errand boy for a dictator!"</p>\n<p>She sighed. "I broke the case. I did good work. I keep people safe! Or I will be, from now on."</p>\n<p>"You're a strange girl!"</p>\n<p>"It's a strange world! I'm <em>adapting!</em>"</p>\n<p>"That doesn't make any sense!"</p>\n<p>"Yes it does in the context of the last couple of days I've had it makes complete sense <em>Father</em>..."</p>\n<p>"Why didn't you just join the Navy like I asked you to," he said. "You could have been the captain of your ship now, in the Philippines Squadron..."</p>\n<p>"You and your damn boats! I get <em>seasick! </em>Years I spent in the back of the boat throwing up!"</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Charleston was disturbed by the security arrangements. The CSA was supposed to be handling everything, but the contingent seemed too small. After all these years he could smell a secret policeman a block off. There just weren't enough people.</p>\n<p>"I was going to ask you if this was normal arrangements, but how would you know?" he said to Temperance after she stormed away from her father.</p>\n<p>"I spent all day learning my part," she said grumpily. "I pulled everyone's file. All the RSA people here have applied to the CSA, or have a personal relationship with somebody in it."</p>\n<p><em>[Bureaucracy spend.]</em></p>\n<p>"They check their watches a lot," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"They're waiting for something," said Millicent. "This is not good. Mr. Chiu, why don't I give you a guided tour of the building? Maybe our lab facilities."</p>\n<p>"Sounds like an excellent way to spend the time," said Charleston. "Keep an eye out for when they start to kill everyone."</p>\n<p>Temperance waited until he and Millicent had left and then sidled up next to Colonel Ballantine. "Is everything ready?" she whispered.</p>\n<p>"Yes," he said. "We have a security detail watching everything."</p>\n<p>"Nothing...unusual?"</p>\n<p>"You were expecting something?"</p>\n<p>"In my position you're always expecting something."</p>\n<p>"You know what," said the Colonel, "if you think something strange is going on we should check it out. Personally. I can't pull anybody off duty\u2014that might be what they expect, you know, the anarchists or Reds."</p>\n<p>They pushed their way out of the ballroom and into one of the smaller reading rooms. It was dark, and as Temperance reached to turn on the lights she sensed some motion behind her. She spun around just in time to see Ballantine drawing his pistol. She slid to one side, grabbed the arm, and in a swift series of movements that would have made her father proud grabbed the gun from his hand and threw him into an armbar.</p>\n<p>"Whose orders," she said, almost nonchalantly.</p>\n<p>"Screw you," he panted.</p>\n<p>"It takes four pounds of pressure to pop a joint out of a socket," she said.</p>\n<p>"It won't matter in ten minutes."</p>\n<p>She sighed and pistol whipped him in the back of the skull.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Upstairs, Candace glanced around the room and suddenly realized, with a shock, that the President and the Premier were nowhere to be seen. She slipped out of the ballroom and she caught a glimpse of both men being led down a staircase into the basement surrounded by a bunch of security people. It looked official. Maybe. She followed after them as quietly as she could.</p>\n<p><em>[Sense Trouble roll with a Benefit; HP took Unnoticed to follow them.]</em></p>\n<p>Temperance saw her leave the ballroom but was having trouble escaping her mother. "When are you going to make Colonel," slurred Ruby. "Won't you make your mommy proud?"</p>\n<p>"I preferred you when you had one arm," said Temperance and strode away. She caught up to Candace at the top of the stairs. "What's the meaning of this?" they could hear President Lund saying.</p>\n<p>"Sorry sir it's for your own safety," said one of the CSA people.</p>\n<p>"Something is going to go down in about seven minutes," whispered Temperance.</p>\n<p>Candace strained her ears. She could hear a heated exchange between two CSA officers as they came down the stairs. Something about a nuclear exchange between China and Japan. About the British launching bombers. About Vancouver being hit.</p>\n<p><em>[TP: So, World War One. For this world.</em></p>\n<p><em>Me: Apparently China has taken the lead in long-range rocketry.]</em></p>\n<p>"We need to leave," hissed Temperance. "These people are doomed. We have to find the others."</p>\n<p>"Wait a minute," said Candace. "Someone's coming."</p>\n<p>"I know that smell," said Temperance. "Drugs. Fear. Unchecked aggression. Charleston?"</p>\n<p>"What aggression?" said Charleston, coming up the stairs in a huff.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474753/#Comment_474753" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-14T18:56:12+00:00" title="June 14, 2018  6:56PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: A Funeral in the Mirror (Part 19)</b>\n<p>"We have six minutes," said Temperance. "Come on. Joyce will pick us up on the roof."</p>\n<p>"We have to get Helen," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>Temperance sighed and led them into the ballroom. As they opened the door, they were confronted with a grisly sight. Blood was pooling on the dance floor, blood from the piles of bodies all around the room. In the center of the room, a well-dressed man in a bowler hat who looked somewhat Chinese was standing. He was holding Helen from behind, her arms pinned against her back.</p>\n<p>"I didn't do it," said Charleston automatically.</p>\n<p><em>[Three point Stability loss. This took Millicent to -1 and Temperance to blasted. She challenged her Drive statement to refresh some Stability.]</em></p>\n<p>"I am Mr. Han," said the man. "Some of you may have heard my name. Mr. Chiu, you were supposed to be on our side. But I think you are not the man we thought you were. We're all having such a good time. Don't you think we should all unmask?"</p>\n<p>Temperance drew her pistol but didn't fire. "Normally I only need two ladies," said Han. "And here I have so many."</p>\n<p>"The Stranger," said Temperance. "The unknowable darkness."</p>\n<p>"You complement me," said Han. "But that is my Master. <em>I wear no mask</em>."</p>\n<p>"Can we leave?" asked Millicent.</p>\n<p>"I don't see how that would benefit me. If you wait just a little longer the advent of my Master will be at hand. You know this world is lost," said Han.</p>\n<p>"We weren't trying to take it from Him. He can have it," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Perhaps He would like to have all of you."</p>\n<p>"On the other hand perhaps not," said Charleston. "Who are we to question the tastes of the great Unknowable...whatever his name is."</p>\n<p>"Perhaps we should wait until the King arrives," said Han.</p>\n<p>"Perhaps we shouldn't," said Charleston quickly.</p>\n<p>Temperance shot Han, steady, aimed fire, multiple shots into his shoulder. He let go of Helen and Millicent, who had dove for him the minute Temperance began firing, pushed her away from the Stranger.</p>\n<p>"Surely you are the greatest danger here," Han said to Millicent. With his good arm he picked her up as if she didn't weigh anything and threw her into the wall.</p>\n<p><em>[5 points of Health.]</em></p>\n<p>Helen crawled toward Candace, who yanked her up and pushed her toward the exit. "We have to go!"</p>\n<p>Charleston raised his hands in a non-threatening manner to distract Han while Candace and Millicent stumbled after Helen. He opened his mind to the darkness that lurked inside him, writhing inside his stomach ever since his encounter with the Dark Lord in Carcosa. He let go the iron control he had subconsciously maintained...</p>\n<p>And his tongue lashed out across the room like a hideous green tentacle and wrapped around Han's neck. He shook him like a dog worrying a bone and tossed the mysterious man out the window.</p>\n<p><em>[Cthulhu mythos spend, 3 point Stability loss, Athletics roll for the attack.]</em></p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>As Millicent fled through the hallway she sent her consciousness wandering. Across town Betty suddenly had a vision of Millicent standing in her livingroom. "You've got to get out of the city! It's going to blow! I love you!"</p>\n<p>The vision faded before Betty even had time to scream.</p>\n<p>On the roof Joyce had just touched down. "Where to now?"</p>\n<p>"Brookhaven!" everyone shouted.</p>\n<p>"Everybody wants to go to Brookhaven," she muttered.</p>\n<p>"You shouldn't want to go back to the city," said Millicent as she climbed into the co-pilot's seat. "Nuclear war has begun! They hit Vancouver!"</p>\n<p>"But I just bought an apartment in Queens!" said Joyce as the helicopter shot eastwards into the night.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later, with the dark farmland of Long Island flowing below them, there was a bright flash in the west.</p>\n<p>"What the hell was that?" said Joyce.</p>\n<p>"Don't look back at it," said Millicent. "Just keep\u2014"</p>\n<p>That was when the shockwave smashed into them. The helicopter slewed violently and went into a spin. Alarms rang as Millicent and Joyce fought for control of the aircraft. "She's going down\u2014" said Joyce.</p>\n<p>The helicopter shook suddenly, autogyroing in the vortex of wind. The electronics all seemed to have failed simultaneously. "Starter's fried," babbled Millicent. A stand of trees was rushing up to them\u2014</p>\n<p>When she came to, Millicent saw that they had smashed into the upper branches of a pine tree and tumbled down another twenty feet to the ground.

Temperance was clutching the saddle horn in terror, but trying to be game. They passed the guard post\u2014the guards had fled already\u2014and rode down to the water shed.</p>\n<p>In the basement lab, Schicksal was agitated. "What's going on up there?

"Just tell me one thing: in your world was I a good man?"</p>\n<p>"Yes," lied Charleston. "The best. He achieved something absolutely amazing. Your genius will live on."</p>\n<p>"At least my genius will then," said Percy morosely. "Time to take the powder."</p>\n<p>"Temperance, hold my hand. We're doing drugs," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"I'll take your drugs. I'll go through your portal. But I am <em>not</em> having sexual relations with a woman, you understand me!" said Temperance. "And I hate your friends' poetry!"</p>\n<p>"Just snort it," said Charleston in response to Temperance's questioning look. They shuffled into the portal. "I'm sorry Mr. Schicksal," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>Percy threw the switch\u2014</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Darkness. Cold. Something like a wind, like a mist, flowed over each of them, separated them.

"Why did you leave me to die again?" he accused.</p>\n<p>"You're not my husband!" Candace shouted.</p>\n<p>"I was your husband..." shrieked Andy. But Candace didn't hear him. She felt calm. Warm. Embraced. In the darkness was someone who was with her. Who loved her. Who inspired her. Who wanted only her. Not Andy, who was only flesh and bone...</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Millicent found herself in the presence of a woman with an aristocratic face and long black hair, fashionably dressed in an exquisite black gown and smoking a cigarette with a bored look on her face. She exhaled smoke at Millicent. "Well look who is fashionably dressed for once," the woman said. She had an upper class British accent. "Come and give daddy a hug why don't you."</p>\n<p>"I'm still really confused about that," said Millicent. "I always thought Uncle Jack\u2014"</p>\n<p>The woman guffawed. "Not bloody likely."</p>\n<p>"But Vanessa is my mother."</p>\n<p>"Oh yes. She was quite capable. Once I gave her what she wanted."</p>\n<p>"So then...you're a god."</p>\n<p>"Quite."</p>\n<p>"Mom never explained that part," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Oh, I quite liked your mum," said Nyarlathotep.</p>\n<p>"She knows.

Kill everyone who defied my will...that just seems so d\xe9class\xe9."</p>\n<p>"Thank you for your forbearance."</p>\n<p>"Not so much forbearance as...biding my time. That's the fun thing about monkeys. They all die eventually! Well, not you so much."</p>\n<p>"I keep forgetting I'm not mortal," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"I don't understand. Why don't you just <em>transcend</em>. Instead of going back to Earth, you could just <em>leave</em>."</p>\n<p>"You're sounding like a human parent! Stop!" pleaded Millicent.</p>\n<p>Nyarlathotep stopped midsentence and took a violent drag on her cigarette. "You really know how to hurt your old dad," she said.</p>\n<p>"I didn't mean to, I just know you're better than that."</p>\n<p>"You're such a disappointment, you know that?" said the god.</p>\n<p>"I'm really good at that," said Millicent.</p>\n<p>"Oh, and if you see Chuckles, tell him I'm not looking for him anymore. Tell him that I think he'll take care of things all by himself, no need for me to intervene."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Charleston saw a tall, austere, thin man loom up. His skin was midnight black, and he was wearing a clerical collar.</p>\n<p>"Who are you?" said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I feel insulted you don't recognize me," said the man with a heavy West Virginia twang.</p>\n<p>"We've met? Are you a social worker?"</p>\n<p>"No. We shared an intense physical bond once."</p>\n<p>"Baby, don't bring up the past\u2014wait a second..." Charleston stared through the gloom. As he feared, the man's face was identical to his own. "You! The usurper!" he said.</p>\n<p><em>[Back in the Post-Modern Masks of Nyarlathotep, Charleston's sanity dropped down to 0 during the Africa section.

But even a broken clock..."</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>They woke up to a crushing pressure on their bodies. Millicent blinked through the dust. They were in a room that looked like the basement of the MacAllister building. It looked like most of the building had joined them in it.</p>\n<p>Temperance began screaming for help. Her father had trained her well; she had a voice that could make an Admiral jump to attention when she used it. A fireman poked his head down into the hole.</p>\n<p>"I thought we checked dis area," he said in a broad Boston accent. "Whaddya, appear outta nowhere?"</p>\n<p>After a while they were dug out and rushed to the hospital. "You guys didn't come out so bad," an orderly told Temperance. "Not like that old codger who got a rebar through his chest. Some old derelict, grey hair, messed up face. Some loopy blonde dame with him, says she's been looking for him for months."</p>\n<p>"What month is it?" said Millicent groggily.</p>\n<p>"Whaddya talking about? It's May first. Happy May Day, ya goddamned Reds."</p>\n<p>"We went into the building in February," said Temperance. She grabbed the orderly's arm. "What year is it!"</p>\n<p>"What's wrong wit you! It's 1956! Brooklyn won the World Series last yeah!"</p>\n<p>"I had money on the Yankees," muttered Temperance.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>A few days later Millicent wheeled herself into Charleston's room. Her leg was setting nicely; the doctors were impressed with how quickly the bone was knitting. "Mr. Chiu? I have a message for you."</p>\n<p>"These are never good," said Charleston in his plummiest tones. The free morphine was a definite perk of his stay.</p>\n<p>"No, no they're not," said Millicent glumly. "He's not looking for you anymore. He says He's pretty sure you'll take care of the problem yourself."</p>\n<p>"I'm not good at taking care of problems," said Charleston. "Who sent the message?"</p>\n<p>"He's...maybe a god?"</p>\n<p>"Oh, <em>that</em> asshole?"</p>\n<p>"I think he meant not that you were going to solve any problem," said Millicent. "I think he means that whatever He was going to do to you, you'd do it to yourself worse."</p>\n<p>"Did I ask for the Cliff's Notes? On bright side, that insipid loser is off my back. Worst ex I ever had. Obsessive\u2014"</p>\n<p>The radio next to the bed suddenly exploded.</p>\n<p>Charleston looked up. "Still listening, huh? You're not going to get over me that easy!"</p>\n<p>Millicent was boggling. "He's your ex? Because that's a kind of thing in my family\u2014"</p>\n<p>"No, no, not that I'm aware of. My life has some blank spots. I apparently found religion at one point. But I'm telling you I'm not finding it again!"</p>\n<p>"That's okay you can lose it that's fine with me," Millicent babbled.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>That afternoon, safely back in her room, Millicent was visited by a rather serious looking blonde woman. She wore a plain sweater set and horn-rimmed glasses, and she looked over them at Millicent. "Are you...Millicent Lowell? I think we were looking for you. Beth Queen."</p>\n<p>Millicent shook her hand. "Miss...Mrs..."</p>\n<p>"Doctor, I guess," said Beth. "I'm an anthropologist by trade. My published work is under my married name, Schicksal."</p>\n<p>"I'm so sorry," Millicent blurted.</p>\n<p>"No cause for alarm," said Beth a little quizzically. "How are you?"</p>\n<p>"I was lost for a while. Really lost. But now I guess...I don't know."</p>\n<p>"My friend Mr. Wright nearly died looking for you. Was it...worth it?"</p>\n<p>"I'm not even quite sure what I was looking for anymore. Or if I found it. But I didn't mean to draw anyone after me. I didn't want to cause trouble."</p>\n<p>"All this for...a high school English teacher? I don't understand." Beth fingered a folded up piece of paper in her hand; she'd been doing this nervously ever since she came in. "I have so many questions that I think I should ask you," she said to Millicent after a moment. "But I'm afraid of the answers I might get, so I don't think I'm going to ask them. Miss Lowell...just do me one favor\u2014"</p>\n<p>"Stay away from Mr. Wright?"</p>\n<p>"Please?"</p>\n<p>"I'll try! I really will!"</p>\n<p>"Miss Lowell...I don't know exactly what you are. But I know there are a lot more unusual things in this world than I thought. Maybe you should be doing more of what Mr. Wright is doing. So that Mr. Wright can stop doing it."</p>\n<p>"I'll have to talk to my sister about that," said Millicent after a pause. "She'll probably think it's amusing.

His wife Vera came in behind him, carrying a vase of flowers. "I tried reaching you for months, you took a leave from your university, then I heard you were in a collapsed building? Very unprofessional."</p>\n<p>Candace smiled back. "It's wonderful to see you."</p>\n<p>"We were on Cape Cod," continued Nabokov, pulling up a seat. "On an expedition if you will. Look here." He fished out a jar. Inside was a perfectly preserved butterfly, with brilliant yellow colors on its wings. "I was thinking of naming it after myself. But...I think naming it after you, would be appropriate in this instance. It's a new species, I'm almost sure. Of course I need a microscope."</p>\n<p>"It's an honor," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"You look terrible, if you don't mind me being frank," said Nabokov in his strangely-accented English. "I am a little worried about you, my dear. I know it has been very difficult to adjust. But it's eleven years now since Andy died. Haven't you found anyone new?"</p>\n<p>"Not any one in particular," said Candace.</p>\n<p>"Modern Western women," said Nabokov, throwing up his arms. "Even in Berlin it was more demure. Now. The doctors have told me that you are frail, and the psychiatrists\u2014those quacks\u2014tell me you require many weeks of therapy. But I know exactly what therapy you need."</p>\n<p>He took out a bottle of excellent vodka.</p>\n<p><em>[Nabokov was actually a quite impressive amateur lepidopterist. And famously dismissive of psychiatrists.]</em></p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Temperance woke up to see Colonel Murphy sitting next to the bed, holding her hand. "I thought I lost you there, baby doll," he said, choking up.</p>\n<p>"Father...what are you doing here?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"A building dropped on you! What do you think I'm doing here? The first thing I thought was 'Jimmy Wright must be involved!' And I was right!"</p>\n<p>"We saved <em>him</em> this time," said Temperance with a weak grin.</p>\n<p>"You saved his life?"</p>\n<p>Temperance winced the memory of Other Jimmy's autoabbatoir out of her mind. "Events happened," she said.</p>\n<p>"When I write my autobiography, the part about Jimmy is going to be called <em>Events Happened</em>," said the Colonel. "Actually, that's a good name for it...the Ashley Murphy story. Maybe get Audie Murphy to play me..."</p>\n<p>"We still in Arkham?" said Temperance.</p>\n<p>"They transferred you to Boston. What were you doing at Miskatonic any way? Look, the best decision you ever made was to drop out of that dump."</p>\n<p>"We were looking for a woman. We found her. Millicent Lowell."</p>\n<p>"<em>Millicent</em>? I thought I told you to stay away from that crazy dame."</p>\n<p>"We had to find her. And we found her," said Temperance with fervor. "I feel so alive and awake and...<em>aware</em> of everything."</p>\n<p>"That's probably because of the collapsed lung," said Murphy.</p>\n<p>"I only need one! Isn't that what you always said!"</p>\n<p>"There is a lot of redundancy, yes..."</p>\n<p>"One lung, one kidney, and half a liver! The Murphy way!"</p>\n<p>They laughed. "When you feel a little bit better," started the Colonel. "I know I gave you that RV...but that wasn't really a present, just what you need to continue in the Murphy way. So I didn't so much buy you a present as...well...one day it will be yours. I bought a boat."</p>\n<p>"It's been twenty years, pop," said Temperance slowly. "Since you burned the last one."</p>\n<p>"I was hoping maybe we could take it out to the Vineyard."</p>\n<p>"Perhaps. But I have a mission now. I was too passive before. Not making a stand for what I knew was right. I see the truth. I know what I need to be doing. Maybe one day, father\u2014"</p>\n<p>"Darling, I just have one question," said the Colonel. "What the hell is this mask doing in your bag?"</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>Helen was sitting vigil over Charleston from her wheelchair.</p>\n<p>"Hey babe, you made it back," he said, stretching his arms.</p>\n<p>She took a long time to respond. "This world's real, isn't it?" she said at last.</p>\n<p>"Sweetie, I don't know what to tell you. I don't really know. I'm beginning to suspect that they're all <em>real enough</em>."</p>\n<p>"There. You did it again. You are always doing it. Where you say something that's supposed to sound like it's comforting but all it does is make me feel all weird inside. Also the <em>morphine is not enough</em>," she said hysterically.</p>\n<p>"I finally get you to a place where you can have all the morphine you want and it's not enough?"</p>\n<p>"What can I do now? I saw what happened there."</p>\n<p>"Back there is gone now," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I ain't got a home anymore," she wailed.</p>\n<p>"Of course you do," he said.</p>\n<p>"Am I real?"</p>\n<p>"Of course!"</p>\n<p>"How would you know?"</p>\n<p>"Listen. I think you're real...I don't know how to comfort you in your time of misgiving. But would you rather be in a place that you thought was real but was not that great a place to be and got leveled in a flash of sunlike temperature? Or would you rather be in a place that you're not so sure is real, but good things happen? Good things are good things. Accept them when they come," said Charleston.</p>\n<p>"I can't decide if it's better to be with you, since you're the only one who even remotely understands what I'm going through, or if I should just run away from you and try to live out whatever weirdo delusional life I got left," said Helen. "Or if I should just finish the job I started."</p>\n<p>"You run, I'll follow," said Charleston. "It will be fun. We'll go wherever you want. Once our legs work."</p>\n<p>"See, there you go again. You say something that sounds terrible, but is actually comforting." She smiled.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479400/#Comment_479400" name="Item_229" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-01T21:23:42+00:00" title="January  1, 2019  9:23PM">January 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>"I'm not going to miss you," said Percy.
