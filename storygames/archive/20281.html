We're not the biggest in the world. We have a small and loyal following because most of our players are improvisors, and we approach play as a performance rather than a regular game. <br/><br/>This year at Gencon we are running a panel discussing how our approach to play changes when we run games for our show. Alot of story gaming is closely tied to emulating performance mediums like TV, theatre, or film. I feel like some members of the story gaming community would be interested in this discussion. Obviously we would benefit from your questions and input.<br/><br/>If you are attending Gencon and want to attend our panel please check it out here:<br/><a href="https://www.gencon.com/events/82081" rel="nofollow">Playing as Performance: The Art of Actual Play</a><br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
