Here's some background:<br/><br/>1. A <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18010/monsterhearts-this-game-starts-at-11#Item_18" rel="nofollow">recent discussion</a> about how to use "gaze into the abyss", and what it takes to trigger it fictionally.<br/><br/>2. My <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17927/joe-mcdaldno-writing-monsterhearts#Item_26" rel="nofollow">"writing Monsterhearts"</a> thread, where I discuss the differences in the text in describing the move, and include some interesting stuff Joe wrote about the move in the playtest version of the game.<br/><br/>So, what's the deal with <i>gazing into the abyss</i>?<br/><br/>* How often do you use it in your games?<br/><br/>* Can you relate any interesting "gaze into the abyss" moments from a game you played?<br/><br/>* What kinds of Hard Moves do you think are a cool response to a failed <i>gaze into the abyss</i> move? What happens on a failure?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408508/#Comment_408508" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T13:28:24+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  1:28PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's something I'm wondering about:<br/><br/>Joe writes in the first thread linked above that he sometimes refers to gazing into the abyss as the "Google montage", when a character is seen sitting at a computer and images are flashing over the screen.<br/><br/>In my current M&lt;3s game, I have a character who may be investigating some weird video files when he next gets to spend some time at home alone. Would that be a good time to roll "gaze into the abyss"?<br/><br/>So this has got me wondering whether "gaze into the abyss" might be a little more flexible than I used to think. Perhaps it's a good move to roll anytime a character is doing something solitary and searching for answers. Your character goes to the library to try to get some answers, or spends some time at the museum, or maybe breaks into the police station Records office after hours? Roll to gaze into the abyss.<br/><br/>This would certainly make the move a lot more important, and it could be a useful tool for a game which doesn't have a "default" move or procedure to fall back on in such situations. What do you think? (Or do you already do this?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408514/#Comment_408514" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T13:47:49+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  1:47PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Joe writes in the first thread linked above that he sometimes refers to gazing into the abyss as the "Google montage", when a character is seen sitting at a computer and images are flashing over the screen.</blockquote>\nRather, the Google Montage is one kind of gaze into the abyss.

I think the AW-open-your-brain parallel and the name of the move kind of run interference on this idea of broader applicability -- this is also why removing all the personification-of-the-abyss text that was present in earlier versions was probably a solid move. In AW, there really is a thing called the psychic maelstrom, and everybody really is on some level doing the same thing when they open their brain, even if it is subjectively different. In Monsterhearts, that CAN turn out to be true, but it's not strictly necessary at all.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408529/#Comment_408529" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T17:01:08+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  5:01PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

I was Adam the Hollow, who was once a demon but was now stuck in a human body. The Witch over-hexed an insulting student (Adam's friend) and he was tossing up this black fluid over the floor. In a bit of a stupor from the chaos, Adam tasted the stuff and that was Gazing. When I blew the roll, the world sorta faded away and I found myself face-to-face with The Infernal's Dark Power, The Poisoner, standing over the kid, and Adam was stuck in this paralyzed stare while the world was moving around him. Best thing: as a former demon, I knew exactly who he was, and knew I was right to be terrified.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416572/#Comment_416572" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T06:59:37+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  6:59AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The creativity here is staggering!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416575/#Comment_416575" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T07:31:46+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  7:31AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know, right? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416607/#Comment_416607" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T16:53:25+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  4:53PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2013 5:09PM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From another thread:\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">@EpistolaryRichard</a>,<br/><br/>It sounds like you've learned, over time, to trigger gazing into the abyss as an MC move. I'd love to hear more about that!<br/><br/>What does it typically look like, in play? What makes you decide when a good moment for it might be? Are there certain player actions which invite it, or do you pick moments which suit your agenda as the MC, instead? <br/><br/>What kind of information do you find it helpful to exchange, whether MC-to-player, or the other way around? Thinking of Gaze as a meta-communication tool is interesting stuff, I think.<br/><br/>When you do so, do you ask the player to roll the dice, or do you just bring on the visions as an MC move?</blockquote>\nSure. But just to put context around my experience, I run a lot a pick-up/one-shot games. This means I typically MC with no-prep (prior to the session that is) and no breaks mid-session to talk to players outside the game.<br/><br/>Let's talk about Gaze as a communication tool first.<br/><br/>When I started, I hated it when the game - as it often does - told me that I suddenly come up with something cool. This could happen any time the dice get rolled (like on a miss), but it's especially bad with Gaze into the Abyss where on a hit you still have to come up with stuff at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>And so, as I found it pressuring, I figured I would share my pain with the players (six heads better than one etc).<br/><br/>Start with an example where the Gaze directly relates to another PC: the Serpentine gazes into the abyss with a question about what weakness the Chosen has. I could have supplied a vision of my own - and hoped the Chosen's player would roll with it - but instead I turned to the Chosen's player and said "Okay, what does he see?"<br/><br/>When the Chosen provides the weakness, the player is communicating to me - and to the other players - where they want to be pushed. It ensures that the weakness is in line with the Chosen's concept of their own character. And even if the Chosen's player isn't comfortable generating the entire vision, they can say that her weakness is "her friends" and that gives me inspiration. Also, as MC I can add or amend the vision that the other player provides.<br/><br/><br/>A different example from the same game: the Infernal gazes into the abyss by communing with his God/Dark Power about how he can better serve him in the future. I knew nothing about the Infernal's player as he'd joined the game late, but he appeared to have ideas and so when he passed his Dark roll I put it back to him "What do you see?" The player then detailed the Infernal standing in a locker room and then running out onto the football field, naked. I knew that the Vampire was a player on the football team and so this told me that the Infernal wanted some screentime with him.<br/><br/>Outside, the Serpentine was watching the Infernal's house from his car (all part of his backstory) thinking on what it was to be human. That sounded brooding and introspective to me, so I asked if he was also gazing into the abyss, he said yes, and I added him to the vision on the football field. I ask what he does and - naturally - he says that he tackles the Infernal. <br/><br/>This all communicated to me a potential conflict that I hadn't identified. The war between the Infernal's God and the Serpentine's family then became a major element to the resulting 'pilot episode'. <br/><br/><br/>This brings me onto something else I mentioned, that happened here without prior intention, using Gaze into the Abyss to allow two PCs to interact without actually being in the same place. It worked well here, but I'm not sure how I feel about encouraging a wider use. Having PCs inhabit the same gaze is cool when it's setting up rivalry or conflict or common-ground for the future; it's not cool if gaze just becomes a supernatural walkie-talkie. <br/><br/><br/>Let's flip it around and talk about the MC communicating to the players. In my Dresden High AP, you've already seen my use to put one PC in the frame for the killing of another PC. The kind of vision that I would provide a PC would be something that draws their attention to one of my 'hooks', that addresses one of their concerns (like Chase the Werewolf wondering if he should be cured), that reminds them of consequences of their previous actions or which highlights a potential relationship that I think has been neglected. <br/><br/>The player can have a very specific question, but even on a 10+ you can always add more detail to the vision to include such content. <br/><br/>You can also throw in random stuff if you like (see the Cheese Man in the Buffy episode 'Restless' as an example), but it's best to give yourself time to build that out if the players suddenly leap upon a random item as the most significant part of the vision.<br/><br/><br/>Just talking about the specifics:<br/>   What does it typically look like, in play? The player describes their character doing something I think might qualify. I ask them "Does that mean that you're gazing into the abyss?" If they say 'Yes' then I have them frame the central question of their thoughts. Then they roll dice. If it's a hit and the question was about another PC then I may turn to that player and get their input, at least as inspiration. If the question's about themselves, then I might go back to them (but always reserve the right to reframe the vision). If I want to dangle a hook then I'll do that. If it's about an NPC, I might frame the vision but still allow the player some input for me to understand where their mind is going. If it's a miss, then you Hard Move. <br/><br/><br/>What makes you decide when a good moment for it might be? Pacing, really. Gazing is introspective and, normally, only involves one character. You'll naturally feel whether the story wants the pace slowing down to focus on a single character's desire or whether it needs speeding up to include as many PCs as possible. Honestly, though, the players' own behaviour will drive the pace as well. So if they're describing their PCs being all introspective then they're probably sensing that the pace can slow. I've never actually intentionally skipped over obvious 'Gazing' behaviour because I wanted to speed things up. <br/><br/><br/>Are there certain player actions which invite it, or do you pick moments which suit your agenda as the MC, instead? Always player actions. The players are aware that there's risk in Gaze into the Abyss - as in all rolls - so unlike Hold Steady, I don't impose it. My agenda is floating, so they do their actions and then I see if my agenda provides anything to their agenda. It's a lot of thinking on your feet, but I'm willing to take a breath and say "I'll come back to you in a couple of minutes with that! Let's quickly flip to something else." <br/><br/>When you do so, do you ask the player to roll the dice, or do you just bring on the visions as an MC move? I always ask the player to roll the dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416608/#Comment_416608" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T17:41:42+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  5:41PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great answer, thank you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416722/#Comment_416722" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T12:29:08+00:00" title="June 20, 2013 12:29PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah Rich, awesome examples and exposition.
