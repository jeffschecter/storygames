What's "hard" scene framing?  How do "hard", "harder" and "hardest" differ from each other?</blockquote>\nThe "hardness" of scene framing refers to how sharp, immediate and unnegotiable the dramatic demands of the scene are upon the protagonist character set in the scene. A scene is framed softly when it is established in gentle dialogue with the character player and allowed to develop organically towards the actual meat of the scene. A hard frame is one that moves directly, quickly to the core issue, and does not include negotiated niceties.<br/><br/>For example, let's say that the GM or whoever is framing the scene gets the idea that it would be cool to have your character accosted by a crazy homeless person claiming to be their father, and maybe the character remembers just now that this is, indeed, the case. (We're playing a psychological horror game of some sort here, I guess.)<br/><br/>A soft frame would be something like "What do you do with your days normally? OK, let's say that you're on your way to the mall. The day is sunny, birds are singing. What stores will you visit? Cool, on the way to Gamespot you see this homeless guy sitting at the curb..."<br/><br/>A hard frame would skip the preliminaries and take liberties with placing the character into a relevant situation: "One day, while shopping, you are accosted by a homeless guy..."<br/><br/>(The very epitome of a soft frame would be when the GM doesn't even <i>have</i> an idea in mind for the scene - they just start talking about it with the other players, and perhaps some sort of a point emerges as they do. This kind of framing is all but non-existent in dramatic terms.)<br/><br/>The different degrees of hardness would refer to the amount of pressure put upon the character by a hard scene frame. A "hardest" scene frame would presumably be one that leaves the player no room for maneuver: the character is in a fixed situation, forced to make a single choice, and all that's left is to tell how they feel about it and what they will do. In the context of the above example the hard frame could be made even harder by having the GM drop the entire dramatic idea of the scene in monologue before allowing the character player a word edge-wise; only after they've introduced the NPC fully and established that the character is fully committed to facing an awkward social situation in a public setting is the player allowed to decide how they will react; all opportunity for prevaricating is taken away by the framing.\n<blockquote>For these descriptions of scene framing, what are some game examples of them?\n<ol>\n<li>democratized scene framing</li>\n<li>negotiated scene framing (a subset? of democratized)</li>\n<li>round robin scene framing (a subset? of democratized)</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\nScene framing is democratized in games that give everybody a voice in how the scenes are framed, of course. Specifically, I think that for a process to be truly democratic it needs to somehow take into account multiple voices; taking <i>turns</i> to set a scene is not necessarily democratic, it's just dictatorship that rotates <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I do not remember a simply democratic game out of hand, but I suppose there might be some somewhere. By "simply" democratic I mean something where the players outright vote on the next scene to be played - that would presumably be the epitome of direct democracy as regards scene framing <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Scene framing is negotiated when multiple players have a real say in which scene will be played next, and what it will be like - we might well consider this a subset of democratic framing. The players literally negotiate about the direction of the story. <i>Ars Magica</i> features highly negotiated scene framing due to its creative agenda leanings, for example. Other games that give explicit doctrinal nods to negotiated framing are <i>Primetime Adventures</i> and <i>The Mountain Witch</i>. It is notable, though, that in all of these cases the negotiation aspects are more or less informal advice, hardly enforced by systematic means. (This is important to me personally because I like all of these games while not being much of a scene negotiator myself - I play the last two particularly with rather hard, dictatorial framing.)<br/><br/>In general I don't think that Vincent necessarily has much basis for being tired with democratization, considering how relatively rare it is. Then again, I've no idea what he's been playing through the last few years, so maybe this is a common phenomenon in his neck of the woods. Many games are certainly easy to drift towards either more negotiation or less, so I can easily imagine how "storyboarding" (a type of democratic hard scene framing, sort of) and such can occur for some people in games where they don't for some other people.\n<blockquote>These are mentioned as alternatives to democratized\n<ol>\n<li>unproceduralized and presumed naturalistic</li>\n<li>dictated by procedure and fiat</li>\n</ol>\nWhat is naturalistic?  How are unproceduralized+naturalistic and dictated by procedure/fiat mutually exclusive with democratized?  Can't I have procedural rules for scene framing and still do round robin?  Or procedures for handling negotiation?<br/></blockquote>\nScene framing is naturalistic when we pretend that there is no artistic decision-making in what we discuss next in the game; basically, whatever scene occurs next is whatever of significance would happen next in the fictive world, according to the players at hand. Nobody gets to make bold assumptions or focus the story with framing choices, and bringing it up at the table is an effective veto if somebody does. This is how games with "no scene framing" work - everybody gets to demand scenes provided that they fall logically into the chronology.<br/><br/>Democratization is exclusive with these ideas because both of these methods cause scene framing decisions to be made without hearing explicit artistic or partisan choices that individual players might wish to be made in this regard. In naturalistic framing we constructively pretend (or really believe) that no framing decisions are taking place, and thus it is impossible to be democratic, because we refuse to discuss the decisions that are taking place subtextually. In procedural framing we cannot make democratic choices because there are no choices to be made: the procedure tells us what shall be framed next, taking the choice away.<br/><br/>Specific to your suggestions, "framing by procedure" is different from "framing by negotiation regulated by procedure". The former is like in <i>My Life with Master</i>: the procedure says that next scene will be about your minion doing the Master's bidding (as per the last scene). The latter is like <i>Primetime Adventures</i>: you get to choose focus and characters, I get to say where and what.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457094/#Comment_457094" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-14T09:13:12+00:00" title="October 14, 2016  9:13AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>For these descriptions of scene framing, what are some game examples of them?\n<ol>\n<li>democratized scene framing</li>\n<li>negotiated scene framing (a subset? of democratized)</li>\n<li>round robin scene framing (a subset? of democratized)</li>\n</ol>\nOkay, I get round robin scene framing.  That's pretty much what almost all story games that rotate around from Fiasco to Microscope (not to imply that those are at two ends of any particular continuum).<br/></blockquote>\nWait a moment... I believe you're getting two things confused. What could be called "round robin" in Fiasco is just <i>whose turn it is</i> to set the scene, not the actual <i>framing</i> of it!<br/><br/>In Fiasco, <b>procedure dictates</b> which character is central to the next scene, in that the scene is "about" them or has consequences to them. This is part of framing the scene, of course - it tells us, for example, Rafu's character is in the scene - and the procedure we follow here is simply taking turns - we focus on Rafu's character because Rafu is sitting next to Eero, whose character we last focused on.<br/>Then, in Fiasco, I get a procedural choice, because it's my turn: I can either frame or resolve.<br/>If I choose to frame the scene, there's no further negotiation involved: it's just my decision, my <b>fiat</b>, informed by what makes sense in the fiction, what "naturally" follows from previous scenes, etc.<br/>If I choose to resolve, though, I'm outsourcing the job of framing the scene to the other players as a collective. Being more than a single individual, they necessarily have to <b>negotiate</b> it somehow - even when the negotiation is sometimes implicit and actually boils down to a player framing the scene according to their individual idea and no one else stopping them.<br/>Overall, the whole game can be said to be <b>democratic</b> in that the procedures afford everyone equal opportunities.<br/><br/>By contrast, it's conceivable there's a game where the actual <i>scene framing</i> procedure is "round robin", in that everybody takes turns adding to the framing. I've once designed such a game, actually, though it's meant to undergo significant revision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457095/#Comment_457095" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-14T13:46:14+00:00" title="October 14, 2016  1:46PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, softness refers to how much the previous scene flows into the next, I think.

The framing is soft if the GM separates the act of beginning the scene from introducing the scene's raison d'etre, and hard if they bring that core issue front and center.<br/><br/>As I remarked earlier, the very softest imaginable scene is framed by a GM who does not even have an idea of why that scene exists; they merely set the stage and let the characters do their thing, hoping that it leads somewhere. Such a scene <i>can't</i> be hard-framed, as nobody knows a priori why the scene exists, so everything executed in it is by definition emergent. It's the absolute softness <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The very opposite of that is a scene that goes immediately into the crux. Let's say that the crux is a Bang (this is a narrativist game), the GM's notes have "this hated NPC is left to the PC's mercies - will he pull the trigger?" The very hardest possible frame for this would be something like so:<br/><br/><i>You're holding a gun to the head of this NPC that we talked about earlier. Will you shoot?</i><br/><br/>This is not hard because it lacks narrative detail so much as because it does not obscure the GM's intent in introducing the scene in any way. We could discuss what the NPC looks like, or other narrative details, but gilding the setpiece would not obscure the abruptness of how the issue is introduced. A softer way to frame the same thing would be something like this:<br/><br/><i>You drive to the abandoned warehouse, holding a gun. You hear Him puttering about inside. What do you do?</i><br/><br/>That's still pretty hard, but not nearly as much; the dramatic intent, the Bang of it, is still clearly visible to the player, but there is leeway. The scene could turn away from the GM's intended Bang by e.g. the player deciding to leave their gun in the car or whatever. However, we can go even softer while preserving the dramatic intent:<br/><br/><i>Next week nothing much happens in your life. However, one day you get a phone call from your informer - they've found Him, his hideout is in this abandoned warehouse near the docs. What will you do?</i><br/><br/>Note that the GM still possesses their own idea where this scene is going - he's going to leave the hated NPC on the mercies of the player character. However, the player no longer perceives this intent from the start of the scene - he'll need to decide whether he'll pursue the lead, perhaps take friends to help him, or whatever. Depending on the game and GMing methodology the GM may use various interactive ways to bring his Bang on (maybe the scene morphs and he ends up bringing the NPC to the PC, instead of vice versa), or it may be subtly evaded due to the relatively soft frame. I would not call this frame "hard" anymore, but that doesn't mean that we can't go any softer:<br/><br/><i>After the last events are over you return to your life. What will you do next, speaking of next week or so?</i><br/><br/>This is even softer because the GM is inviting the player to bring his own input to the scene's direction first. It is still not the absolute softness I introduced above, because the GM still has their agenda of bringing the NPC to the mercies of the PC, but he's willing to work for it, weave the idea into whatever the character player gives him. This is a traditional acme of scene framing, by the way - so soft that a player simply cannot know whether you have an agenda or not.<br/><br/>As can be seen, all of those scene frames are about as sparse in fictional detail. I do not deny that abrupt narrative style often accompanies hard scene framing, but I think it's not direct causation so much as a psychological feature of why we produce verbose narratives in the first place: colorful narration is usually used to set the tone of a scene, which is then used to provide emotional context for the crux of the scene. When we frame hard, we reveal the crux early, and this simply makes colorful narration less useful - the moment when we would have benefited from setting the tone has already passed, and now we have this provocative issue on the table, so who wants to hear about the birdsong, anyway.<br/><br/>Incidentally, a little technique that I find myself using often when hard framing: you drop the bomb, whatever it is (in the above example, the reveal that the NPC is now at your mercies, and you have to choose how to deal with it), and then narrate descriptive detail largely <i>afterwards</i>. This has the advantage of lingering in the moment and leaving the player some natural space for musing over their choices in the scene; while the GM describes how the NPC is sweating, or perhaps monologuing about the past wrongs of the NPC for the benefit of the group, the player can immerse in the situation and think about what their PC wants to do about it. So it's not like hard framed scenes necessarily lack in lingering lyrical narration, it's just often beneficial to put it in a somewhat different position in the scene's structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457103/#Comment_457103" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-14T17:43:15+00:00" title="October 14, 2016  5:43PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I do not remember a simply democratic game out of hand, but I suppose there might be some somewhere.

Chosen color is overruled if 3/5 of the total tokens were a single other color (we played with 5 total people).<br/><br/>5. Player whose color was chosen becomes GM for the scene and start player rotates. Frame the scene you described and go. Feel free to use or completely ignore all other written words.<br/><br/>6. If it's a non-combat scene, play it out and goto 1. If it's a combat scene, set up the encounter. (We had techniques to make this rotating improv 4e encounter prep not suck, often they worked). All enemy initiatives must be the same. Whenever it is the enemy's turn, do steps 1-5 but your word limit is 11, chosen player becomes GM only for that turn, and when the encounter is over revert GMness to original GM until the scene ends, usually very quickly or even immediately.<br/><br/>This worked surprisingly well. We started with a somewhat inferior version for a one-shot, refined it over a couple of sporadic one-shots, and actually played a short campaign with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457104/#Comment_457104" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-14T17:52:38+00:00" title="October 14, 2016  5:52PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a quite amusing way to play 4th edition D&amp;D - I like it!

When we play Fiasco, one of the things we're still tweaking as a group is how much to define when framing a scene.  We want enough "hardness" so that everyone in the scene knows what to do i.e. no one flounders in the scene, but not so much that we've "played the scene before we played the scene".  Though maybe I'm still not getting the hardness thing.<br/><br/>The comment then is that it feels to me like if you are starting with the crux of the scene with a really hard framing, you've essentially played the scene in the framing.  Of course, if the hard decision is not the crux of the scene, then it's fine, because there's still places to go once the bridge has been crossed.  At that point, I would just say you're starting with action.<br/><br/>I do definitely feel that you should start a scene late and end early.  Start the scene in motion and end it before it starts to drag.<br/><br/>The other thing we do with Fiasco (and maybe it's against the rules) is that while the person whose turn it is owns the framing, other people toss in ideas while she's setting it up.  Sometimes she says "no, doesn't fit", other times it's "oh crap that's better than what I had, I love it".  And then as soon as it's barely baked enough, we run with it.  Our best games are when we get that right in the sweet spot for most of our scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457106/#Comment_457106" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-14T19:09:26+00:00" title="October 14, 2016  7:09PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you feel like you "played the scene before you played the scene" you are doing it wrong, IMHO.<br/><br/>The point of hardness is to cut to RIGHT BEFORE whatever important thing is the point of the scene.

I've met plenty of people who strongly dislike the entire idea of scene framing, preferring to pretend that no such thing is occurring, and being most comfortable with scenes that do not have any overt "subject matter". (This is more common for certain types of simulationist and gamist agenda than narrativist interests, obviously.)<br/><br/>A player with this sort of preference might well feel that a scene framed hard has "already been played" in the sense that the exploratory, implicit discovery of how the events are unfolding has been skipped. <i>Maybe</i> there's one big choice left to be made, but for a player who finds the choice obvious and uncompelling, the real meat would have been in how we got there.<br/><br/>I personally like to alternate soft and hard framing in many games, mostly because it's a way to distribute opportunities for story direction between players. A soft frame, in addition to its stylistic effects, makes more room for the non-framing players to contribute to story direction. It's not an insignificant advantage, although there are games where such interactivity is unnecessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457109/#Comment_457109" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-14T22:40:28+00:00" title="October 14, 2016 10:40PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wonderful, everyone.

It suggests that you should "decide which people are present, and what they are doing", which is basically the only scene framing guideline, but seems completely central to making the game work.<br/><br/>This sounds, to me, precisely like scene framing in a lot of RPGs, but, specifically, it is "soft" framing, by Eero's taxonomy (from above: there is no clear or explicit dramatic goal to the scene, but, rather, it is free to evolve wherever we take it).<br/><br/>While the players are directed not to "progress" the scene, which is unusual for a story game, is there some specific you do in framing the scene itself which is, perhaps, not apparent to me from the game's text?<br/><br/>My reading of it, as far as I can see, is:<br/><br/>* Someone says: "Two men are sitting on a park bench, playing chess." (This is the initial scene frame.)<br/><br/>* Players take turns adding one element at a time.<br/><br/>So, this sounds like a fairly typical (if low-detail) way of "soft framing", but the unusual part is how the scene progresses - adding details, without trying to chain them together or build towards conflict or other story progress.<br/><br/>Then, for later scenes, you specify whether they are a different situation, or a situation combining people from two previous scenes. That sets parameters for scene framing, as well.<br/><br/>That's what I got from your text. How close am I to how you actually play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457140/#Comment_457140" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-16T19:40:32+00:00" title="October 16, 2016  7:40PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your goal is to play scenes and you want to get the framing out of the way ASAP so that you can get to the point of play, then the slowness of discussing or negotiating the framing sounds like a bad fit.<br/><br/>If the discussion and negotiation is <i>part of the fun</i>, though, then take as much time with it as you like, and enjoy!<br/><br/>I can't recall encountering any games which (a) really benefit from tracking a lot of positional variables but then (b) introduce democracy or negotiation into framing.

That was a key element in what I think of as a huge leap in the aesthetic quality of my own role-playing - i.e. much more interesting plots.<br/>If you think about it, in most round robin scene framing, GMless/full, each PC's a protagonist designs - <i>Polaris</i> and so on - it's the exception, not the norm, that two PCs are in the same scene. At surface level, you could think that works because each player has a "job" to do in almost all scenes, but actually it works because (when, if) the content of those scenes is good enough that just playing audience to them is entertaining.<br/>No reason that can't also apply to games with a GM/MC role, then! In AW, specifically, there's no need to try and put PCs together - they're gonna get together anyway because they need each other, because of their unique talents which make them the go-to persons for this or that, or because of their relationships. Most likely, they won't be able to each go on doing their separate thing without crossing each other, and having to resolve such conflicts somehow. As the MC, playing support characters to put PCs at odds with each other is almost warranted to get everybody's attention.<br/>Or I'm thinking of <i>Sorcerer</i>... My experience with good, scary <i>Sorcerer</i> games is of PCs not knowing each other but incidentally crossing each other's path at some point, and then... well, let's just say that the mere existence of another sorcerer - to say nothing about their being close by - is as non-ignorable as any good kicker or bang.<br/>My bottom line being: if those scenes you <i>aren't</i> participating in aren't gripping you, you aren't doing it right (yet).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457166/#Comment_457166" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T01:26:31+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  1:26AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really agree.

Being unconstrained by the need for party scenes was obviously central to this development, and key to <i>that</i> was developing a new attitude towards how the game is played. No longer would the players turn on-line when their characters are in a scene, and off when they're not; in the new paradigm you are an attentive participant in play whether your character is in the scene or not. Each new generation of games in this tradition gets better about this, too, enabling players in ways that have nothing to do with whether their own personal character happens to be present in the scene or not.<br/><br/>Of course that sort of thing isn't for everybody, but it's so ridiculously successful (I do not discuss majorities or popularities; the simple fact of being locally gloriously functional suffices) that I don't have the balls to naysay it. It never occurred to me last week that there would be something wrong in the game where my own character was only present in 25% of the scenes, and I spent the rest of the time framing, running NPCs and kibitzing in the audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457171/#Comment_457171" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T02:11:05+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  2:11AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not being bound to "all party play, all the time" is fantastic.<br/><br/>Not being bound to "our characters are whoever they are and may or may not interact much" is also fantastic.<br/><br/>Making interesting protagonists who have damn good reasons to do most of their interesting stuff together is not hard, IMO.

We used to talk about "blood opera", games featuring tight dramatic scenarios that pit player characters against each other rather than them teaming up against a GM's setup. With that sort of setup it's just natural that each individual scene will feature 1-3 of the player characters in various combinations. It's soap opera vs. adventure drama, thoroughly different structures.<br/><br/>I can't say that I prefer one structure over another, but what I can say is that I prioritize being faithful to the premise over either; nowadays it pains me to see an artificial PC party setup, such as e.g. Whitewolf games feature. If the game's about independent protagonists, then let it be about that. If it's about a team, that's fine with me as well. I'm just glad that I can be true to the subject matter.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of one of my big personal breakthroughs in game design - this was sometimes in say or '01 or something like that... I'd figured out that the true story structure of pulp fantasy is about a lone wolf swordsman traveling around and getting into various situations, and I was wondering how one could fit that story better into a roleplaying game, without taking on all the hassles involved with a traditional PC party. It was quite exciting when I realized that I could just design a game with one player character that would be played by each player in turn, while the others would provide GMing and take on temporary sidekick roles. As I remember it, player downtime was not a concern at all when we played several sessions of this game; if anything, the players were more engaged than usual, because everybody had more to do in the game when instead of running hanger-on PCs in scenes that didn't require multiple protagonists they were always busy with framing and NPC portrayal and such.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with liking to have your own personal player character underneath you all the time, but I guess that I'm just a bit of a fan of the alternate model, too. If I had to give a prediction about the future direction of the hobby, then I'd say that non-party-based play is here to stay <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457176/#Comment_457176" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T03:32:02+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  3:32AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2016 3:37AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of "faithful to premise" vs "PC party set-up": hi, Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>I actually dig PvP as a way to get PCs into each other's scenes.

I hope you don't mind if I ask for your opinion on this, now  that you stated that aloud.<br/><br/>I don't mind a bit of downtime in these kinds of games where it's common to have 1-2 PCs per scene and the rest are in the audience, but as you're discussing I think it's worthwhile to give the players that aren't in the scene some tools to contribute and not just "help the GM out".<br/><br/>A quick background: I'm designing a PbtA/BW hybrid that's very close to the classic drama/action blood opera with individual characters that belong to different factions. The PCs are connected through their beliefs, but they don't need to be in active conflict from the start. The game's explicit object is to find out how the situations in play change the player characters. The PCs have traits that embody their primary behavior patterns, like zealous, cruel or single-minded.<br/><br/>My solution was to combine the basic idea of FATE's compels and Burning Wheel's traits. With this setup the players who aren't in the current scene can compel the characters on screen to act according to their traits so that they end up in trouble. For example if a zealous character is talking to a heretic, an off screen player can compel them to escalate the situation into a conflict in some way. If they accept this complication, they get a grit point (your basic hero point in the game) and mark a + on your trait. If you refuse, you mark a - on the trait. These + and - signs have significance later in trait reviews and affect how your traits change and how much grit points you get when you lose a trait. Players are also rewarded with grit points at the end of a session based on how many times they compelled others.<br/><br/>Does this sound like a meaningful enough way to contribute to the fiction while you're not on screen? You're basically constantly watching for opportunities to compel other characters and occasionally find them, but likely not in every scene. Would this be something you'd personally enjoy?<br/><br/>(As a reference, here's the current version: <a href="http://frozendepths.net/blightburgh/Blightburgh%20playtest%20%232.pdf" rel="nofollow">link.</a> We're starting the next playtest run next week.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457179/#Comment_457179" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T13:39:46+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  1:39PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm designing a PbtA/BW hybrid that's very close to the classic drama/action blood opera with individual characters that belong to different factions.

It could not possibly come up often enough to give me and every other audience member a meaningful role at the table without being disruptive, though.<br/><br/>I like compels best as an unbiased reading or exploration of characters, not as a grab for participation by the compeller or a bribe to the compellee for doing what another player wants.  The occasional prod from the GM is sufficient for me.  (I do generally play with folks who don't need much help getting their characters in trouble, though.)<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I do think offering compels from the audience is better than nothing.  I just don't think it's quite enough to make audience fun for players who aren't already cool with it.<br/><br/>I would play this, but I'd also be hoping for more screen time than audience time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457182/#Comment_457182" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T14:06:17+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  2:06PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2016 2:06PM by BeePeeGee.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting thoughts here.<br/><br/>On the <i>concept of scenes in RPG</i>:<br/>For some games or groups, it is better to keep it fluid and don't structure the game into scenes. Sometimes, it is also good to play tightly focused scenes.<br/><br/>On <i>what to do with players when it is not "their" scene</i>:<br/>Games nowadays keep innovative mechanics to keep everyone hooked-up. One of my favorite is from <i>Tokyo Brain Pop:</i> Each PC has a best friend and a rival. When your character screws up i.e. your rival (player) decides about your character's outcome.<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer loosening up the <b>player-character-monogamy</b>. When you can get players focused on interesting stories and plots - and not identified with "their" character - this allows a great range of flexibility for scene framing.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457187/#Comment_457187" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T14:37:58+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  2:37PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2016 2:39PM by Airk.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've some experience with the roleplaying hobby, but I wouldn't be daring enough to say what most people are interested in at the gaming table <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nHa. Ha. But c'mon.  There aren't hundreds of articles (Those haven't gone away. People are still wrestling with this) written for GM help about how to keep your players engaged when they're not on camera because everyone is super excited to just watch, guys.  \n<blockquote><br/>For my own part, I share the rough outline of Rafu's creative experience - the very idea of treating player characters as real protagonists who go where they will and create the story by their choices was revolutionary for my gaming. Being unconstrained by the need for party scenes was obviously central to this development, and key to <i>that</i> was developing a new attitude towards how the game is played.</blockquote>\nI don't understand how this can be so revolutionary, honestly.  I've been playing games where party scenes weren't "required" for as long as I can remember.  That doesn't mean that party scenes aren't desirable, however.  There hasn't been a "constraint" present in my gaming regarding this, but there is certainly an incentive, and no, those are not the same at all.\n<blockquote>No longer would the players turn on-line when their characters are in a scene, and off when they're not; in the new paradigm you are an attentive participant in play whether your character is in the scene or not.</blockquote>\nI view this as completely independent of whether or not party scenes are "required" or not - one is a mechanical "here is how this game is structured" and one is a social contract "here is how people behave" and yes, one can influence the other, but neither necessarily follows from the other either.\n<blockquote><br/>Of course that sort of thing isn't for everybody, but it's so ridiculously successful (I do not discuss majorities or popularities; the simple fact of being locally gloriously functional suffices) that I don't have the balls to naysay it. It never occurred to me last week that there would be something wrong in the game where my own character was only present in 25% of the scenes, and I spent the rest of the time framing, running NPCs and kibitzing in the audience.</blockquote>\nIt never occured to you that large numbers of games still don't do any of those things?  (Other than permitting kibitzing).  Certainly someone has already mentioned how this is less of a problem in GMless games because those games are more inclined to give players something to do when their character isn't appearing in the scene.   I would venture that "Players get bored of being in the audience" is a complete non-thing in Polaris... but that's not because Polaris magically makes people happy about being an audience, and instead ensures that everyone is participating regardless of whether or not their character is present in the scene.  Which is NOT something that say, Apocalypse World does.  This is not about "players have to be their characters at all times" but rather, about games that don't give players any other way to interface with the game other than passively watching.  And that category includes a lot of very good and well regarded, not to mention widely played, games, so acting like it's a solved problem is not really appropriate.<br/><br/>I agree that forcing a "party system" onto the players when there is no reason to have one is bad.  But that doesn't mean that just saying "Oh hey, you guys don't actually have to ever be in the same place, that's cool" fixes the problem with those games.<br/><br/>This is, however, well off the topic of "scene framing" however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457190/#Comment_457190" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T15:57:21+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  3:57PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that character orientation (relative to the plot) is a HUGE part of all this. The paradigm shift which occurred for many (players and designers, both) over the last however many years was the shift from "GM preps plot, characters run through it" to Character as the creator or driver of plot.<br/><br/>Once the character's personal ambitions and desires become the driving factor in the development of the story, the approach to play changes very dramatically. It almost demands for a breakup of the traditional "party" approach to play, for example, unless there is a unifying factor of some sort to the game's dynamics (e.g. in D&amp;D, all the characters have an interest in finding treasure, and it is easier to do so together, so it doesn't matter if they completely distinct reasons for doing so).<br/><br/>I think that this really affects people's involvement with the particular game. This is particular on my mind recently because I'm starting a game next week with some people who are, essentially, non-gamers. They seem to have no trouble creating character concepts who are driven by dramatic goals. However, there is a new fellow who is joining us, and he is an experience "trad RPG" gamer (D&amp;D, Call of Cthulhu, etc). He seems like a fun guy, and I'm looking forward to it. However, I sent the description of a tense situation - a place rife with conflict, with lots of things for characters to care about or get hooked into - and he came up with a character concept, which... is far more reactive, as I've often seen with dedicated gamers. He says this of his character's interests:<br/><br/>"His ambition is to make his life easy and not too dull until his request to get reposted goes through."<br/><br/>It's always a bit of gear-shifting moment when I realize I'm going to have pull out a few of the player's fingernails just to find out what they're interested in...<br/><br/>Scene framing ties into this directly, since it's based on allowing opportunities for whatever the driving force in moving the game forward may be. (For instance, if we're playing treasure-hunting D&amp;D, we're pretty much always going to frame with a thought towards "how this situation can lead us towards some treasure", whether it's looking for a place where there might be some, preparing to go to a place where there might be some, or dealing with dangers along the way towards it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457191/#Comment_457191" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T16:44:59+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  4:44PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure; That feels tangential to me.

As Paul says, "a GM-led plot and party of PCs generally would not be a terribly good match for democratized scene framing."

Parceling out bits of the traditional GM duties to different players is one of my favorite engagement techniques.<br/><br/><i>How We Came to Live Here</i> has two GMs, one for Outside society and the other for Inside society.  One of the coolest bits about that is that the two can brainstorm together and help each other out.<br/><br/><i>Archipelago</i> allows authority over specific domains, like I'm the go-to player for the Undercity while you're the go-to player for Organized Crime, regardless of whose character is on screen.<br/><br/><i>Polaris</i> spreads out interesting NPC roles relative to the PCs, but ultimately that's up to who frames a scene with whom, and can produce more or less pure audience time depending.  I like the HWCtLH / Archipelago version better.  I'm inferring that <i>Tokyo Brain Pop</i> is more in that direction, right?\n<blockquote>Personally, I prefer loosening up the <b>player-character-monogamy</b>.

I know people who play like distracted wallflowers in party based games, but are on fire in their own spotlight scenes and vice versa. In my experience these people are often more casual players. I've also noticed that the most hardcore indie folks seem to play actively in most games whether it's round robin scene framing or party based dungeoneering. Based on this I'm suspecting there's a skill factor involved as well.<br/><br/>When I'm playing a game with individual characters that get spotlight scenes, I use my audience time to plan what to do next when I'm given the spotlight to avoid slow scenes and indecision. Likewise in challenge oriented D&amp;D it's essential to have a swift decision making process for the player group or play grinds to a halt when there's a tough or ill-defined decision to make. Unfortunately I haven't found that much advice on these kinds of soft player skills in game texts. I can think of many reasons for this, perhaps it's because designers feel that casual players ignore them, or that players don't read rulebooks, or that generic advice is easier to write than precise techniques.<br/><br/>AW was a notable leap to the right direction for clear GMing advice and it's much praised for it, so I wonder if there's room for clearer player advice on these topics as well. Efficient play varies wildly depending on the game's structures so generic advice doesn't cut it. It'd be useful to analyze how different kinds of scene framing techniques and driving forces mesh with player psychology. The least we can do is set the right expectations for the players, though I don't think that's enough. <br/><br/>Paul, I'm guessing you told the experienced guy what kind of a game you're playing, but that alone wasn't enough to orient them for character creation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457251/#Comment_457251" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-19T11:58:46+00:00" title="October 19, 2016 11:58AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2016 11:59AM by lumpley.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as Apocalypse World goes...<br/><br/>The scene-framing rule for the MC in Apocalypse World is:<br/><br/><b><i>Give every character good screen time with other characters.</i></b><br/><i>Bring them onscreen in pairs and triples, in obvious groupings and unlikely ones too. Play with their natural hierarchies and bring them into circumstances where they might have something to say to each other.</i><br/><br/>...Followed by some concrete suggestions.<br/><br/>So by default, the MC should never let the PCs scatter. Apocalypse World's rules presume that most or all scenes will include at least 2 PCs, in changing combinations as play proceeds.<br/><br/>Now, this rule isn't absolute, it's subject to the MC's agenda. In particular, it's subject to the MC's judgment about what will make the characters' lives interesting. So when the MC thinks that the characters' lives are more interesting if they're isolated, that's her call to make. <br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Types of scene framing? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20819/types-of-scene-framing/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Types of scene framing? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20819/types-of-scene-framing/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="(Nice, Vincent!)

It often has an initiator who gets a consensus on a starting point, but nothing quite like a traditional GM. And it requires a lot of on the fly consensus building for the equivalent scene framing as well, at least if it is done successfully ( they all had fun). There also tends to be more of a willingness if not to outright veto ideas, at least vocalize preferences to the group and negotiate away from undesirable directions.<br/><br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>FWIW, I tend to like Mythic GM Emulator's scene framing:<br/>Roll up random bits that are then thrown together naturalistically and messily based on the context  of the game. Whoever first comes up with something that makes sense given the bits you have blurts it out. If there are no strong disagreements or obvious alternative interpretations of the rolled up bits offered, run with it. If there are alternatives, just build consensus quickly and go on with it.<br/><br/>In fairness, I do tend to treat MGME as a tool to aid Play Pretend, I mean FREEFORM, more than anything else.<br/><br/>Works well for me though.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457407/#Comment_457407" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-23T03:38:14+00:00" title="October 23, 2016  3:38AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, KomradeBob, I might indeed try to get back to the <i>Childhood Play Pretend</i> feeling.

It suggests that you should "decide which people are present, and what they are doing", which is basically the only scene framing guideline, but seems completely central to making the game work.<br/><br/>This sounds, to me, precisely like scene framing in a lot of RPGs,</blockquote>\nThe real game happens in between the scenes [situations], when the participants tries to figure out (individually, in their own minds) how everything fits together. The scene framing doesn't end after one person declares the people (or person) and their activity, it continues through-out the scene in a collaborative manner. For example, saying "two people arguing" can change to being on Iceland and involves two  people from Somali when other participants add to the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457455/#Comment_457455" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-24T21:14:39+00:00" title="October 24, 2016  9:14PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2016 9:15PM by BeePeeGee.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>: regarding <i>ScenePlay</i>, I'm still favoring using the Micro-Templates and the Cards and ditching the scoring system entirely.

The latter is definitely the more "gamified" aspect, and in fact it was the original portion.  The storygame parts became more central as I did research and worked on the project, until the collaborative game superceded the more abstract scoring system.  It probably needs to be broken into two games. :-)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457461/#Comment_457461" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-24T23:52:15+00:00" title="October 24, 2016 11:52PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For example, saying "two people arguing" can change to being on Iceland and involves two  people from Somali when other participants add to the situation.</blockquote>\nOh, so when you say "decide which people are present..." you don't mean for the players to say who the "people" are, but just a vague description?

Like I said in the first two paragraphs: "Take the time and watch someone on the street. /.../<br/><br/>I remember when I did that, trying to come up with answers about someone I didn\u2019t know, and I got that tingling sensation in my gut as if I was riding a roller coaster. The same feeling I got the nights when I lay back in a  eld, watched the night sky and wondered how vast the universe really was."<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>You could make it work. I will have to playtest that. The thing is that you need to combine Situations (a collection of scenes in memories, present time, and hopes) and if you only talk about places, it can be hard to make them be related to each other unless you add any people as memories. People (or items) can change and are mobile. They can also have hopes.... but places are usually static.<br/><br/>But now it's more about <b>Imagine</b> as a game and less about scene framing. Of course you can have that in usual <i>collaborative</i> scene framing, as long as the group knows where the scene framing should lead or what it should contain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457554/#Comment_457554" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T17:08:04+00:00" title="October 27, 2016  5:08PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, thanks!<br/><br/>(And sorry if that was confusing, Adam!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20819/types-of-scene-framing" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20819/types-of-scene-framing" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20819/types-of-scene-framing/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20819%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20819%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
