<p><strong><em>Over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=833&amp;page=2#Item_43" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a> joshua neff wrote:</em></strong><br/>
<code>Why do you think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unavoidable? What about playing RPGs makes it unavoidably a hobby and a subculture that one must commit oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time, energy and identity to?</code></p>
<p>Y'know, this notion ("people can only play RPGs if they commit five hours a week for twenty weeks ... plus if they learn all of Monty Python ... plus ...") keeps popping up in the occasional discussion.  Then joshua smacks it down, and I seldom see people actually <em>defend</em> it, but it ends up popping back up again in another place.</p>
<p>Much fun as the Whack-A-Mole game is, the whole pattern made me think ... is this actually an argument for the restrictions that <em>really objectively exist</em>, or is it a plea for others to recognize the restrictions we <em>want to believe exist</em>?  It seems to be offered more as an article of faith or (even) hope than as an argument of reason.</p>
<p>So I thought to myself ... why would any gamer want to limit the number of people they could possibly try to recruit to a game?  Phrased that way the answer is glaringly obvious:  recruiting people to a game is immensely scary stuff.</p>
<p>Many gamers complain that they don't know enough potential players ... if not for the game they're currently running (which is usually barely-sufficiently staffed) then to try any game that doesn't meet with the approval of everyone they could try to recruit.  "Oh, I'd love to run PTA, but Michelle doesn't like the idea, and I know so few potential gamers that I can't run a game that doesn't please every single one of them."</p>
<p>So gamers know they <strong>should be</strong> recruiting as many people as possible.  But, because recruiting's so scary, they don't <strong>want to</strong> recruit very many people.  The solution is simple:  limit the people you believe it is possible to recruit.</p>
<p>In this thinking:  There is <em>no point</em> to talking to Eddie about gaming, because he's a father of two and even though he loves gaming with a passion he couldn't possibly dedicate the same evening eight weeks running.</p>
<p>There is <em>no point</em> to talking to Mary about gaming, because she has never played before, and even though she is totally looking for something social to do with friends every thursday night for the next year, she isn't a gamer.</p>
<p>The only person you have to approach is George, who has already played games for twelve years, wants a game, and is ready to commit his evenings for the indefinite future in order to get it.  Oh yeah, <em>that's</em> a hard sell!</p>
<p>Some gamers (myself included, if I get lazy) do not make even the most minimal attempt to recruit people to play with them ... they passively wait until an already-convinced gamer falls into their laps.  But it's okay, because they believe that the already-convinced gamer is the only type of gamer that can be recruited, anyway!</p>
<p>Convention play proves that PTA (for instance) can be run in a four hour slot and create a <em>spectacular</em> experience of play.  Under The Bed can be run in less than half that time, and has glass beads (shiny!)</p>
<p>It is <em>no harder objectively</em> to get people together to enjoy such a game than it is to get them together to play trivial pursuits.  There is no greater real barrier.</p>
<p>I totally get that it is <em>emotionally harder</em> to get people together for such a game.  It is harder to ask someone to play Under The Bed than Trivial Pursuits.  But it is (to my experience) no less likely to produce results.  We believe that it's less likely to produce results, because it gets us off the hook about asking.</p>

                            A while ago my wife and I had dinner with two non-RPG-playing friends.  They asked what I was up to, I talked a little about this game I was working on called The Roach, and our friends said "We must play it."  So we did, a week later, and it went very well.  My wife (also a non-RPGer) complained that it required much more mental effort than, say, Apples to Apples, but we all had a good time.  One of our friends even spent the intervening week "thinking up Professors".  It was as creative, fun, and bloody as any Roach game I've played.  <br/><br/>They asked me - up until that point I wouldn't have dreamed of asking them.  This one experience really changed my way of thinking, though.                        </div>

                            Wait, wait. Let me understand your argument. We imagine that we want these things (long campaigns, etc) just to create restrictions so that we can avoid recruiting people?<br/>
<br/>
I think that the annecdotal data I have on gamers doesn't really support this, but, data being lacking, let's take a real example - what about me? I recruit people to play less restrictive games all the time. And I recruit more "hardcore" gamers to play long-term games. I mean, isn't it just possible that some people want the long-term game? <br/>
<br/>
I don't even want to get into the health of long-term games, and whether or not they're something that should be sought - we can debate that elsewhere. Couldn't it merely be that the cigar is just a cigar in this case? That, in fact, people really do want to play long-term, high-committment, games? <br/>
<br/>
To follow Josh's analogy, isn't this akin to the difference between occasionally playing bridge, and having a bridge club that meets regularly and requires substitutes if you can't come, etc? Like my mother's club? <br/>
<br/>
In fact, I think that the reason for the requirement of committment, Monty Python Knowledge Skill, and all of that, isn't so much reticence to recruit others, so much as it is creating social restrictions. In fact, the whole phenomenon could be seen to be a reaction to other cliques in high-school. That is, if I'm not in with the jocks, or with some other group, I can create a sense of superiority for myself by creating a social atmosphere in which I have the key knowledge that makes me the good member. If I can recite Monty Python better than you can, then I'm the Uber Geek. And you can't feel part of the group until you adopt our tribe's ways. You have to subscribe to our notions of what is important, to appeal to us for approval. <br/>
<br/>
Standard social stuff. Geekdom is, largely, a matter of smart people creating their own social restrictions based on understanding of some esoterica. And extraordinary committment to activities that are not simply social. You are not one of us if you aren't willing to make the committment to play every week for four hours or more, and to learn the sacred text of Monty Python. <br/>
<br/>
No, of course this doesn't make it any better a reason to restrict people than if we were doing it because we were afraid to recruit. But I think it's substantively different. Does the impetus to play long-term come directly from wanting to require social committments to make groups restrictive? No, I think that's mixing up cause with effect. I think that D&amp;D said that games shalt be indefinite, and that we fell in love with that idea. Once we got going, however, it was at that point that it became a geek empowerment (meaning it gives you geek power, for whatever that's worth) tool. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that I, for one, have gotten over the need to use long-term gaming and such as a way to create a social environment where I'm the top dog. But I do still want to play high-committment RPGs, and I realize simply that not everyone is going to want to make that committment. That said, that doesn't stop me from recruiting outside of the gamer gene pool. I don't get a lot of luck there (this should surprise nobody, the gamers have to some extent already self-selected themselves), but I'm not failing to attempt to recruit there out of fear or anything. In fact, I find that short-term committment games are good for getting people interested, and determining if they are, in fact, the sorts who might want to play longer term games. <br/>
<br/>
Like getting them to simply play a night of bridge, before trying to recruit them into the high-committment bridge club. <br/>

                            Yeah, I think you make a real good point here, Tony.  The most recent addition to my gaming group never gamed before playing with us--she, in fact, sought us out when my wife mentioned that I gamed, that, in fact, another mutual friend also gamed with us.  <br/>
<br/>
And she has been a wonderful addition to the group--in part because she doesn't come with some of the expectations that other players have brought with them--mostly, though, just because she is enthusiastic and creative in her contributions to the game.                        </div>

                            One of my dad's friends when I was a teenager was Mr. Jessup.  Mr. Jessup played raquetball.<br/>
<br/>
When I say he played raquetball, I don't mean tha the went down to the health club once every week or two to play a friendly game with his buddies.<br/>
<br/>
I mean that he went down to the health club two hours a day for workouts, practice, and instruction from the club's pro, fifty years his junior.   He competed statewide, and regularly won... not only in his 70+ age group, but also in the 60+ and 50+ ladders.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn't know this when Mr. Jessup challenged me to a game.  To say that he kicked my ass would be generous; the game lasted maybe fifteen minutes, and I think that the one point that I did win, the first, was a gift, because every shot he returned was a "kill shot", six inches off the deck and six inches off the wall, lightning fast, and always against the wall that I was furthest from.  I was completely and totally out of my league.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that if Mr. Jessup had been interested in teaching me the finer points of the game (and if I had been interested in learning them) he could have taught me a lot, but neither of us were interested in that kind of relationship.  So we never played again.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this tale applicable to roleplaying games?  I'll let you all decide that for yourselves.  For my own part, of course, I wouldn't have brought up the story unless I thought it was relevant.<br/>
<br/>
For any social activity you care to mention, whether it's games, or sports, or politics, or whatever, there are going to be a certain class of people who do not care to participate with people who are too expert or inexpert compared to themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Playing with people below your level has risks.  You may invest a lot of time and energy in the relationship, only to find that they lose interest and leave the hobby, or worse, ridicule you.  Playing with people above your level has risks.  You may be marginalized or worse, humiliated, as I was playing against Mr. Jessup.<br/>
<br/>
Some people aren't willing to take those risks, gamer and nongamer alike.  Tony, I think you and I can agree that your reserves of self-esteem are deep enough that the damage from a failed overture to invite a non-gamer into a game would be inconsequential.  Would you also agree that it is rare to find a gamer whose reserves are so deep?  Even among those of us who read this board, I think you will find many who aren't generally confident enough to take that risk.                        </div>

                            Fred,<br/><br/>If you're saying that in any activity--RPGs, raquetball, whatever--there will be people who take it really seriously, putting a lot of time and energy into it, and they'll only want to do the activity with people who are similarly interested in putting a lot of time and energy into it...well, sure. No one has said otherwise, have they?<br/><br/>But if you're saying there's something inherent to playing RPGs--and raquetball--that requires that kind of buy-in, that you can't get into the activity without committing a lot of time and energy to it...well, I think that's nuts.<br/><br/>There are loads of casual raquetball players, who play because they think it's fun, but don't put a lot of time and energy into it, and who don't care all that much if they get better at it. I've known people like that. Similarly, no one has shown me anything about playing RPGs that <i>requires</i> investing a lot of time and energy into it--except that most RPGs are designed with the idea that players will invest a lot of time and energy into it, and most RPG players see the pursuit as more than just a casual activity, so they aren't willing to approach playing RPGs as something casual to be done for fun with people who are interested in playing but don't want to (or can't) commit loads of time and energy to the activity.                        </div>

                            Joshua, you're entirely correct, but failing to make the logical conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
The paradox is that the people who want MOST to expand the hobby, the hardcore people who have a great deal of time, effort, and money invested in it, the people who BELIEVE in it... are the ones who are least able to do so, because of the reasons I listed previously.<br/>
<br/>
By BECOMING a hardcore gamer, he has created a distance between himself and "mainstream" culture (if that means anything anymore) that requires effort and risk to bridge, effort and risk that many hardcore gamers are not willing to spend for the minimal gains that accrue from it.<br/>
<br/>
Casual gamers have the wherewithal to bring in other casual gamers (and you can only make hardcore gamers from casual gamers) but no desire to do so, because they have so little invested (in terms of time, effort, money) in the hobby.                        </div>

TonyLB replied:

Why the doubt?  I mean, sure there must be some people who just like the idea of long-term play and have never really had super-fun long-term play, but that doesn't seem to indicate to me that they don't really want it.<br/><br/>I mean, long-term play is still, by far, the prevailing paradigm in roleplaying.  However, and I think this is also telling, most people aren't willing (or able?) to dedicate themselves to even medium-term play of five or six sessions.  If you play <i>Primetime Adventures</i> out of the book, then you should be playing about 6 sessions per arc.  However, the vast majority of the sort of play you're talking about, Tony, is in my experience one-shot play.<br/><br/>I'm finding that, for the most part, if I want to play with my "non-gamer" friends, they're totally willing to as long as we can play in a single sitting.  I get a lot of milage out of <i>Breaking the Ice</i> and <i>Under the Bed</i> for this sort of thing, which is cool.  But I don't get a lot of takers for games like <i>HeroQuest</i> or <i>With Great Power</i>.<br/><br/>Not that it isn't understandable.  A full arc of <i>Primetime Adventures</i> averages about 20 hours of play for me.  20 hours is <i>a lot</i> of time to commit (I could, in that same time, watch a 20+ season of some awesome television show on DVD).<br/><br/>I guess that's all a long-winded way of saying "I find the desire for long-term play to be totally understandable, and I think it's pretty common."<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            I got ya, Fred. And I think you're right about the paradox.<br/><br/>Except...I'm standing up, right here and now, and saying that I've been playing RPGs for 25 some years and take my play pretty seriously, and I don't really give a toss about expanding the hobby, I don't care if RPG sales are down or up, but I am absolutely interested in playing fairly casually with other people who are interested in playing fairly casually. And I'm at least as interested in playing with people who have never played before, but are at least somewhat interested in giving it the ol' college try, as I am in playing with people who have played before and view this as a hobby one has to commit one's time and energy to.                        </div>

<br/>
So if the hobby IS to survive (so that we have people to play with in the future) then those of us who DO care have to step up and take the risks and spend the effort to create new casual gamers, as a long-term investment in our own enjoyment of the hobby.                        </div>

                            Absolutely, Fred. That's why I said in the other thread that as long as the majority of people involved in RPGs--not just the people selling games who have a vested interest in perpetuating the idea that playing RPGs requires a huge investment in time, identity and money, but the players as well--continue this idea that RPGs <i>must be</i> a hobby and subculture, I'll be surprised if RPGs show any significant growth in sales and play. So, yeah, obviously I agree with you.                        </div>

Well, I don't think Capes is a competitive game, it's collaborative. Players compete to get control of Conflicts and Events, but you don't actually lose if you don't get to control a Conflict or Event--you still get cool stuff, and in the end, everyone has collaborated on a story.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is, unlike raquetball, with most RPGs, playing with someone more experienced than you doesn't mean you'll get trounced. And overall, having more experience playing RPGs doesn't mean you're better at it. Playing RPGs doesn't require skill sets like playing raquetball or baseball or soccer.                        </div>

I'm with you here, Tony.  While long-term play may be <i>more</i> fun to some people, that doesn't mean that one shots aren't fun.  I love to play frisbee, but if there's no frisbee to be had, I'll gladly play basketball.<br/><br/>There is an interesting question here though: Do I get people to play basketball because I hope to entice them to play frisbee with me later?  More concretely: how many of us see one-shots as a stepping stone to long term play.  I know that I'm guilty of it often.  I get people to play with me not only because I think they'll have fun, but also because I hope they'll sign up to play a longer game with me.  If this is common, then the complaint that "So-and-so doesn't have the time to play long-term" is actually somewhat valid.<br/><br/>Joshua Neff says crazy stuff like:
<blockquote>Playing RPGs doesn't require skill sets like playing raquetball or baseball or soccer.</blockquote>
And I'm all like "This is crazy-talk!  Did he totally miss the <a href="http://wiki.thesmerf.com/pmwiki.php/Applied/RoleplayingSkills" rel="nofollow">big ol' list of roleplaying skills</a>.  Then I realize he might be saying something different than what I think...<br/><br/>How about it Josh?

                            Josh,<br/><br/>I guess to some degree I agree.  You don't need skills beyond "ability to walk/run" and "ability to kick a ball" to successfully play soccer.  That's just true.  But that doesn't change the fact that some people are <i>better</i> at soccer than others are.  And those people are better because they have more and better trained skills.  They run better/longer/faster, they kick with more accuracy, etc.<br/><br/>It's not that you have to have some esoteric skills to do it, or even to do it well and have fun.  But that doesn't mean that having special skills doesn't matter: it clearly does.  (Well, it's clear to me anyway.)  I mean, my play gets better all the time, <i>something</i> has to be changing for that to happen... doesn't it?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            No, I'm saying I've seen it come easily to people who have never before played an RPG. I've seen it come easily to people who claimed "I'm not very creative" or "I'm not very good at playing RPGs." I'm saying I've never seen anyone who wanted to play RPGs have a hard time of it--unless they had accumulated lots of baggage after years of play, so that they were Turtling or act as Prima Donnas or Typhoid Marys or otherwise engage in other dysfunctional behavior (either purposefully or by habit). But people who are capable of acting like adults, playing well with others, and being open to creative acts (either using their own ideas or using other's ideas)? I've never seen those people have a hard time playing RPGs.<br/><br/>And I think playing RPGs is absolutely nothing like playing soccer. Not really.                        </div>

It seems to me that stuff like improv theater and oral storytelling, and heck plain ol' conversation is stacked with skills that you can learn and improve.<br/><br/>I mean, don't you know people who are relatively mature but who lack certain conversational skills?  I, for one, tend to have a problem with interruption.  I think I know what someone is trying to say and interrupt to say it for them.  Often I am wrong.  I am now working on improving this aspect of my conversational skills.<br/><br/>It just seems crazy to me to say that roleplaying doesn't require skills, or even that it doesn't require the exact same set of skills involved in conversation.  Clearly it requires something different, right?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Well, I got into playing published RPGs because I played a lot of "Let's Pretend" with my friends in elementary school--Superheroes, "Charlie's Angels", "The Six Million Dollar Man", "Star Wars", etc. RPGs seemed like the next step.<br/><br/>In some ways they were (in what the potential was), and in some ways they weren't (the general set-up of the games and the ways the rules generally worked). But that's pretty much what I'm after: grown-ups (well, and my daughter) playing "Let's Pretend." It's sort of like improv theater, only much less so. It's like group storytelling, with the most basic of storytelling.<br/><br/>So, yeah, you need to have basic conversational skills. I don't have any friends who lack basic conversational skills. (Yes, I know people who interrupt other people. I do that myself. I don't see that as being something that gets in the way of playing RPGs.) You need to be able to make suggestions to others and be open to receiving suggestions from others. You need to have a sense of play.<br/><br/>Seriously, it's like you guys want to make this harder than it is. When I was a kid, I had very few friends who found playing "Let's Pretend" difficult. If adults have difficulty playing "Let's Pretend," it's not because they lack certain skills, it's because they've forgotten how easy it is.                        </div>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>We may be talking past each other here, but...  I'm not saying "There's this stack of skills you need to have before you can roleplay successfully or have fun doing it".  I mean, there is a list of such skills, but most of us are aculturated with them.  I mean, if you can't hold a decent conversation then you can't roleplay, but most of us don't have that problem.<br/><br/>What I am saying is that there are skills, some of them related to conversation stuff, some of them related to other things (like plotting, and character design, and certain types of pattern recognition) that make you <i>better</i> at roleplaying.  It's not that you can't roleplay without them, or even that playing without them is somehow not fun.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Yes, Fred, I think that most people live lives of quiet desperation etc etc etc.<br/><br/>I do not, however, think that gets in the way of playing, of all thing, role-playing games. Again, I'm basing this both on a belief that playing RPGs is, at a base level, easy and on my experience in playing with both long-time players and complete newbies (and people in-between).<br/><br/>And yes, Thomas, I agree that some people have skills, natural and/or learned, that make them better at playing RPGs. This does not negate my statement that RPGs are essentially easy to play and don't require a buy-in of time, money or identity, nor do RPGs require special skills to play. They may require special skills to play really well (although the jury is out on what makes someone "a better RPG player"--some people think it's the ability to "get into character," which I think is a bunch of hooey), but they don't require special skills to play at all.                        </div>

                            I do think that living a mundane life gets in the way of joining a roleplaying game.  The reason is that someone who is in that headspace would see an invitation as an opportunity to confirm, to themselves, that they did the right thing in becoming mundane.<br/>

If someone like that could be convinced to give it a try, you would be right.  But I'm not talking about playing, I'm talking about joining, which is an entirely different matter.                        </div>

<p>Fred, your level of bitterness on this is almost embarrassing.  I honestly don't know how to respond.</p>
<p>You're saying that <em>most people</em> are so relentlessly negative that they can't try <em>anything</em> new because they would value the opportunity to mock and disdain people more than they value their own actual enjoyment.</p>
<p>I can't match that with my experience.  Most people I meet are unswervingly driven to believe the best of people around them.  When they hear an acquaintance talk about (say) model railroading or stamp collecting they <em>immediately</em> assume that the people doing it are doing so for good reasons, and find genuine value in the activity.</p>
<p>It is possible that we are just meeting different classes of people.  I think it far more likely, however, that we are meeting with the same ambiguous social cues and choosing to interpret them according to our own different world-views.</p>

                            I would really, really, <i>really</i> like to be proven wrong.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I started the "gateway game design elements" thread is that I plan on bringing one or two games to the office pool party on July 30, and I want to bring the right games.  Since I work at Ticketmaster, 90% of my office-mates are big sports fans, but they have husbands, wives and kids who won't necessarily be watching the game during the party.  <br/><br/>I'm hoping that out of the sixty-odd people who will be there, I can find two or three who are open to a new experience.  I went to last year's party, and there was a serious lack of entertainment for those who weren't interested in the game, or the pool.  Last year, they sat by the pool, eating, drinking, and chatting about inconsequentialities.  I have hope.<br/><br/>I also expect to be the subject of more than a little derision for it, but that's okay, it won't kill me.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that the game I need actually exists, but I'm willing to give it a try.                        </div>

No more so than joining anything else. That's my point. Just about anyone <i>can</i> play an RPG. If they let their hang-ups and "mundanity" stop them from even trying, that's not my problem, nor anyone else's. Nothing I can do for them. But if someone is really so quietly desperate (or whatever melodramatic language you're using) that they won't try playing RPGs, I can't imagine they'd try anything else of much interest. So, fuck 'em.                        </div>

                            I think, given the circumstances, you could set up everything and run with it - "OK, It's a cowboy show called Hotspur Gulch, everybody has 2 screen presence, we've got the sherrif, the outlaw, and the Pinkerton.  Sherrif and outlaw are siblings.  Sherrif and Pinkerton are old pals - the Sherrif used to be his partner.  Plus the outlaw is a lady!

                            Star Wars d6, I'm telling you, it works every damn time.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of good contributions in this thread. I think my answer would be that anyone can play an RPG barring some truly damaging social malady that would keep them from normal everyday interactions anyway. But not everyone will enjoy a RPG.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas, I have your aversion to interruptions. (Believe me, it makes objecting in court an ordeal. JDCorley . o O ( That question is horribly objectionable! I must object! But it's rude to interrupt! Oh, it's over. Crap. ) ) So a mechanic based on interruptions is very difficult for me to play with (see Once Upon A Time).<br/>
<br/>
My wife is averse to character creation, it takes her forever to come up with a character and it's not a forever that she enjoys in the least. Once she's got a character she's highly committed to it, not that she would mind particularly if her character died or not, but she just doesn't want to go through character creation again. Even highly directed and controlled character creation is an ordeal for her.<br/>
<br/>
I of course am a big proponent of the "it's stupidly easy to recruit other people to play RPGs" position, though, so I'm not really the sort of person Tony was asking about in the beginning.                        </div>

                            Actually, with this crowd, a western probably wouldn't be the best choice, but that's beside your point.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at national ratings, the shows that really take off are set in the modern, "real" world, things like Desperate Housewives, House, and CSI.  Medical shows ask a bit too much of people in terms of jargon and stuff, and soapy shows generally require too many people in the cast, so I think a cop show would be best.  People also like shows based on important people rather than scrubs.  Since we're in the DC area, but we don't actually work in government jobs, I'm thinking FBI agents might offer the right combination of familiarity and wonder.                        </div>
