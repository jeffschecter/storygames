Ooh, that's a toughie.  Rob, once you see this, help me out here.<br/><br/>A good 5-ish years back Rob and I looked at Fudge, a game system of choice for us, and saw that it was pretty lacking in terms of what it offered up to someone who didn't want to do all of the heavy lifting of configuring it for their specific game.  We also wanted it to be able to do some new tricks, inpsired by some stuff we'd seen going on in Seventh Sea.<br/><br/>So we sorta reinvented Fudge from the ground up.  Made it more strongly story-focused with setting aside Gifts and Attributes in favor of Aspects, which were a lot like Keys from TSOY, I think, or spiritual attributes from Riddle of Steel, though I'm not entirely sure whether those games existed at the time (parallel evolution, ho!).  Offered a *lot* of preconfigured option packages for how to do things -- eight different magic systems, several ways to do conflict resolution (one of which I think Clinton said he saw and gave him the idea for Bringing Down The Pain), and a modular, pick-and-choose-quickly way to build skill lists for your game.  We also presented a lifepath-esque way of creating characters that linked them to the setting, to each other, and established their history within the larger context.<br/><br/>Then we did it up all pretty and made it free (<a href="http://www.faterpg.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.faterpg.com/</a>).  And then it won some awards at the Indie RPG Awards in its first(?) year -- best free RPG, etc.<br/><br/>Since then we've had a chance to revise the system, locally, a bunch of times, and did some more reinvention again.  This has all been sort of away from public eyes, this time, because it's been working towards the basis for Spirit of the Century and the Dresden Files RPG, which are our effort to take Fate from a "here's our blood and sweat for free" into a "here's our blood and sweat for money" product. :&gt;<br/><br/>But it's hard for me to yap about the specifics in any quick, short form, so let me at least put it this way: If you think Fudge was a good idea, and you really dig "story games", you'll probably love Fate.                        </div>

                            Fate is cool. It takes Fudge and polishes it from a toolkit into a cohesive system. I'm really curious to what changes they've made to the underlying Fate system! Will I have to buy SotC to get Fate 3? :-)                        </div>

<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=4944.msg148037#msg148037" rel="nofollow">One of my first posts</a> on the Forge was in the Evil Hat forum:<br/><br/>"I am in awe.<br/><br/>The aspects system of FATE strikes me as pure genius. As someone who has longed for a maximum of flexibility in character creation along with a simplification in mechanics, this system is amazing. It provides background, depth, individuality, and hooks all in one. I haven't played it, but after reading the rulebook, the pure potential of aspects boggles my mind."<br/><br/>So I'm looking forward to what you guys have done to it in the meantime <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<a href="http://www.faterpg.com/" rel="nofollow">Fate</a> is based off <a href="http://www.fudgerpg.com/" rel="nofollow">Fudge</a> which means that it's core resolution is based on a numerical ladder with each step strong associated with an adjective (so a character may be a Great Swordsman, who is two steps higher on the ladder than a Fair Swordsman).  Resolution is, mathematically, 4d3-8, producing a 0-centered curve that ranges from +4 to -4, with the result translating directly to the ladder (So the Fair Swordsman rolling a +2 gets the same outcome as the Superb swordsman rolling +0).<br/><br/>The math is greatly simplified by the presence but it actually much simpler than that, as it's accomplished with custom d6s which have 2 blank faces, 2 +'s and two -'s.  You roll 4 of them and tally them up, and you're good to go. <br/><br/>Fudge is a freely available system which was originally under one of the conceptual precursors to the OGL, and now is under the OGL, so it has a small but dedicated following of people who have used it to create their own custom builds.  Fate is one of those custom builds, albeit a slightly odd one.  Many fans of Fudge come from the GURPs end of the spectrum, and look at it as a streamline those kind of design principals.  Fate came from another direction entirely, and the differences are enough that it is something of an outlier on the Fudge community, and what ties remain exist mostly because Fred and I still hold the community in high esteem.<br/><br/>So, given that, Fate went in a couple interesting directions, some of which were pretty new at the time, some of which were thinly veiled theft from things we really liked.  The main strengths include:<br/><br/><b>Aspects</b> - This is the first thing that people tend to mention because it's such an oddball, though less so now than it was at the time.  Aspects replace stats, advantages and disadvantages with a general "Things which are interesting about this character".  Mechanically, they are self-correcting.  A "bad" aspect results in the player gaining a lot of extra Fate points (game currency) while a "good" aspect is more likely to grant  a bonus.  The real trick is that the best (which is to say, most mechanically potent) aspects are the most interesting ones, as they are likely to have the most bad AND good.<br/><br/><b>Collaborative Character Generation</b> - This doesn't get mentioned much because, when you read it, it's ok, but complicated, and you move on to the next thing.  It's also time consuming, so people who are just trying the system have a good reason to skip it.  But that said, when it happens, it's something fantastic.  Character generation takes place over a number of phases (which are arbitrary periods of time where events of the setting occur) and serve to tie PCs to those events and to each other. New products (including Spirit of the century) incorporate an <a href="http://www.fudgefactor.org/2004/05/fudge-on-fly.html" rel="nofollow">On the fly character creation method</a> which was totally ripped off from Heroquest.<br/><br/><b>Challenge Tracks</b> - The combat system has a lot of options - three core methods of resolution based on desired granularity, lots of optional rules and so on, but the trick of it is that it's not just the combat system.  The method of tracking an interesting challenge, like getting some information on the street, is mechanically identical to winning a fight.  To couch it nerdishly, we're nuts for story and narrative, but we try to support both task and conflict based resolution because we think they're both cool.<br/><br/><b>8 Magic Systems</b> - Yeah, that's crazy, but it still makes me laugh.<br/><br/><b>Examples</b> - not so much a mechanic, but I feel it worth mentioning that we are religious about the inclusion of examples in the text.  Enough so that this is something I remain proud of.<br/><br/><b>OGL</b> - Fate is freely available as a pdf, and an SRD is available under the OGL.  We believe very strongly in open content, and after Spirit of the Century and our next game, the Dresden Files, are complete we will be updating the core document and SRD to reflect the changes and updates to the system.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have probably already answered _way_ more than you wanted or needed to know, but I hope that gives some framework.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I have a question about the setting: Since Centurions are born on January 1, 1901, and the default setting is the 20s, doesn't that make the heroes awfully young?  Not that there's anything wrong with a pulp hero in his 20s, but I just figure someone like Doc Savage or The Shadow is in his early thirties.<br/>

Remember that the Doc Savage and Shadow stories ran for years and years.<br/>
<br/>
I'm cool with setting a game in the 1930s to adjust for 30+ year old heroes, but I though the default for the setting was the 1920s, and I was just curious why.                        </div>
