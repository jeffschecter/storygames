I hope you won't find the roleplaying suggestions patronising - I'm trying to create a very specific feel with this game, and the specific feel I'm aiming for does mean getting people to try a very "am-dram" approach to roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you like it!<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331781/#Comment_331781" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T21:57:51+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  9:57PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, thanks for sharing! <br/><br/>I am somewhat intrigued by the Soul's Callings--whether your character is redeemed or damned--because you specifically say that it doesn't affect their behavior, only how spirits and others act toward them and what kind of magic you can use.<br/><br/>Also, the subtle hand signals are neat, as are your guidelines on how to try and be immersive. Cool stuff. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Now, it's great that you don't interrupt the flow of play to roll dice during conversations; and even though I'm not a fan of secret rolling and GM fudging, it seems in your game's case the impetus for that is not "ensure the dice don't ruin the game with bad results" but "let the fiction take precedence", which is cool. But here's my question for you, especially in light of your quite involved combat rules:<br/><br/>How do these rules help your goal of immersive play?<br/><br/>In other words, and I mean this seriously: what do any of your rules specifically add to the experience?<br/><br/>Let me back up for a second. My wife and I met playing "freeform", which we still sometimes do. When we play that way, the focus is much different from what I enjoy in table top gaming: instead of conflict-driven, tough-choice-laden, consequence-focused play, we're having a focus on the interaction between the characters, how they feel in the moment, how they affect each other. There's a lot of subtle, sensual, detailed description and emotiveness. We often only play one scene at a time and really get into the characters and the moment. I like to think that this is as immersive and character-interaction-focused as it gets.<br/><br/>Given that kind of experience, when someone is offering up a gaming system that adds rules and dice to that in pursuit of "immersive play," I have to wonder: what does it add to what we already have? Why should we choose to go through rolling dice and looking up results in your tables instead of going with the fictional details and what seems right in the moment?<br/><br/>This is not meant to shoot down your game. I really want to know! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331811/#Comment_331811" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T04:47:35+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  4:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Christian, and thanks for your feedback - you make an excellent point!<br/>\n<br/>\nFunnily enough I've just been addressing exactly the same point over on the Omnifray hosted forums on ukroleplayers.com in answer to a suggestion from Indie Pete of running a session at Indiecon without detailed combat. I'm a live roleplayer myself - I play V:tR MET-LARP, a homebrew non-randomised vampire LARP, a homebrew non-randomised Cthulhu LARP and two high fantasy boffer LARPs and in the past I've played another high fantasy boffer LARP and a dice-based Serenity home-brew LARP. I would agree with you that live roleplay tends to be the most immersive of all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver on the Omnifray hosted forums Pete wrote: "... I do hope that we just roll with impressionistic combat though :) "<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this was my reply:-<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm happy to run a session that's not intended to lead to detailed combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would almost amount to what you would think of as "script immunity" for the player characters. Because impressionistic combat is so much down to the ref's discretion, killing PCs in impressionistic combat could seem unfair to the players and is therefore (though not strictly off-limits) generally speaking discouraged. Because of that, impressionistic combat is generally only used when the fight doesn't pose a particularly elevated risk of death or serious injury to the PCs.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Script immunity" for the PCs could be considered counterimmersive, for instance because it's not 100% believable and may affect your suspension of disbelief or your sense that your character is a real person who is actually vulnerable to death and serious injury. That, of course, is subjective.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy original idea would I think have been to run two of the sessions or maybe all three so that they involve a small amount of combat using the detailed rules (perhaps an engineered example fight near the start of the game or a climactic major fight at some point, maybe more likely both), but that would have been with a view to showcasing the detailed combat rules and it's not strictly necessary. I would think there's always going to be some chance that the PCs are going to get themselves cornered and make a knife-edge fight inevitable, but it can be handled impressionistically if that's the players' preference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis contrast between impressionistic and detailed combat can be understood in terms of Tim Bancroft's analysis using those rather funny terms (to the English ear anyway) of ludus and paidia (see Columns). I guess I like to have me some ludus, and I explain why in the intro guide:- it gives you the feeling of being anchored in a credible reality where your abilities make a tangible difference. On the other hand, freeform roleplay is more puristically immersive (in the in-character immersion sense). I recently posted a simple survey about roleplay preferences on the forums for the V:tR game I play and some of the players have been raving on about game sessions where they never broke character because no fights broke out:- they felt more immersed because they never had to pause the dialogue to get out the dice or playing cards to resolve some grinding combat (boffer LARP has a huge advantage in this respect).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo put it slightly differently there's a tension between on the one hand wanting to keep things as freeform as possible in order to let people simply roleplay immersively (and enhance their in-character immersion) and on the other hand wanting a rules structure which gives you the feeling that your stats mean something, and specifically that your character really does have the qualities that the stats describe (because you can really see those qualities impacting on the course of the game in a tangible and definite way), and therefore that your character is more real.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat tension can certainly be resolved in different ways which come down to subjective preferences, and the Soul's Calling ruleset allows the game to be reffed in a way which caters to a more freeform spirit of play, so if that's what you want then I will certainly plan out a session for Indiecon with that in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================================================================================D<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that throw any light on your question Christian? <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I could add that the more detailed a combat system is and the more it anchors your character's ability in the mechanics of the game in a believable way, the more it can give you the feeling that the qualities his stats describe are real qualities and (and this is the crucial thing) therefore also the feeling that your character is a real person. (If you get the feeling that his stats stand for qualities that are real, that he really has, whose impact you can tangibly see in the game, that implies the feeling that the character is real too - if he weren't, how could his stats describe real qualities of his?) As I say above, this is in tension with, and has to be balanced against, the negative effect on immersion which comes when excessively detailed rules distract you from your in-character state of mind. Where to draw the line is a question of subjective preference. BOTH features of the game (the freeform roleplay and the detailed rules) are intended to be pro-immersive, and the right balance needs to be struck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might be overegging the advantages of a detailed system in my analysis, but Soul's Calling does let you disregard the detailed rules for resolving these things and handle more or less everything impressionistically.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think of all that?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331812/#Comment_331812" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T04:52:36+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  4:52AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I should add - the impressionistic system presupposes that the GM has a general grasp of the detailed rules so that he can envision how things would be likely to pan out under the detailed system, and also because the outcomes of fights (e.g. minor injury, grave injury, terrible injury, death) are the same in both systems (the impressionistic system borrows them from the detailed system).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331971/#Comment_331971" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T17:43:27+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  5:43PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking about it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Will definitely come back to this later.
