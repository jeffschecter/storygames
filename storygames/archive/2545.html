People were playing slideshows, YouTube videos, and songs. But every idea got shot down for one reason or another. And then John Harper pitched this idea out of the blue that totally hooked all of us. The result was The Line.<br/><br/>The Line is a concept show set entirely within the subway system of an unidentified city. Think of it as Lost with a touch of season 1 of X-files. The teaser poster for the show depicts an Australian Aborigine in full outback gear, carrying a spear, standing on a subway platform. <br/><br/>After the pitch and character creation, John created <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/pta/the_line/" rel="nofollow">this incredible image for the show</a>. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s way long, so you need to zoom, then side scroll.<br/><br/>Here are the characters:<br/><br/><b>Henry \xe2\u20ac\u0153Hank\xe2\u20ac\x9d Jakoby</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Player</span>: Brandon Amancio<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Issue</span>: Tempation\xe2\u20ac\u201d\xe2\u20ac\u0153I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been driving trains for 20 years, and I always kep my eye forward like I was supposed to.

I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not going to write about any of the stuff that happened around the table. Instead, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m going to write about the final product \xe2\u20ac\u201c what this TV show looks like to the viewer. At the table, we were jumping around like crazy, changing things that had already happened and tacking stuff on to the beginning or end of the scenes to reinforce what we wanted to convey. The process was pretty cool, but not what the game was really about. This is going to be kind of long and convoluted, but I really want to try to remain true to what we created at the table.<br/><br/><b>The Line \xe2\u20ac\u201c PILOT EPISODE</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scene 1: Moskow Station</span><br/><br/>The scene is a subway station. The station is under construction, but almost completed. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s construction tape covering the escalators. The station is unusually ornate in an older baroque style. The station sign reads \xe2\u20ac\u0153Moskow Station\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/><br/>Mike, a handsome young man, is working beside to set up a stack of film equipment. Some cameras and lights have already been set up, others are still in their cases. From far away we hear a cell phone singing. Mike looks up. He glances around in annoyance, finally spying the cell phone. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s atop a stack of equipment on the far end of the platform.<br/><br/>Mike stands, muttering, and makes his way across the platform. He picks up the phone, but doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t answer it. He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s looking up towards the subway tunnel with a quizzical look on his face.<br/><br/>We hear the sound of a didgeridoo.*<br/><br/>The camera is now behind Mike, looking over his shoulder. Mike is staring into the darkness of the subway tunnel. We hear the didgeridoo again. The camera zooms slowly over Mikes shoulder, deeper into the darkness until darkness fills the entire screen. <br/><br/>We hear the didgeridoo, now very close by. We hear a cell phone run, somewhere very far away.<br/><br/>* If you ever get the chance, ask John to do his didgeridoo imitation for you.<br/><br/>OPENING CREDITS AND THEME SONG<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scene 2: Car 2442</span><br/><br/>Alice is sitting on the train with her laptop open. She has a cell phone to her ear. Morgan is sitting next to her, playing some blues licks idly on her guitar. Jen the commuter is also present. The door to the driver\xe2\u20ac\u2122s compartment is open and we see Hank driving. Chris is attempting to open an access panel. He is wearing a nametag that says \xe2\u20ac\u0153Roy\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/><br/>Jen to Chris: \xe2\u20ac\u0153So you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re Roy today?\xe2\u20ac\x9d They talk and it is revealed that today is Chris\xe2\u20ac\u2122 is a temp worker who covers for Line employees who are sick. Today is his second day on the line.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Alice hangs up her phone complaining about her boyfriend Mike. \xe2\u20ac\u0153He better not have flaked out on me again. He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s so unreliable\xe2\u20ac\x9d. Alice and Morgan start talking. Morgan is writing some music for Alice\xe2\u20ac\u2122s documentary film about The Line.<br/><br/>Morgan and Alice are looking at Alice\xe2\u20ac\u2122s laptop. On the laptop, we see a clip of footage running. It is black and white and shows a bunch of people in 40\xe2\u20ac\u2122s clothing celebrating wildly. We recognize the location as Moskow Station. A young woman in the front of the crowd turns toward the camera and says \xe2\u20ac\u0153It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s so wonderful!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>A short clip of Chris: when he hears this, his eyes dart and he looks like he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s going to say something, but he doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t.<br/><br/>Alice stands and walks to the driver compartment, greeting Hank. Hank asks her \xe2\u20ac\u0153So do you really like this guy?\xe2\u20ac\x9d She replies \xe2\u20ac\u0153Oh, Dad, I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve slept together, but I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m really not sure. Oh my God, am I turning into Mom?\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Stan, the Line police officer enters the car, making a beeline for Morgan. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Hey! You know you can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t play that thing in here!\xe2\u20ac\x9d Morgan replies \xe2\u20ac\u0153It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not like I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m passing the hat. I can do whatever I want.\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u0153I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t care, I want you off at the next station.\xe2\u20ac\x9d <br/><br/>The two start to argue like the best enemies they are. Chris tries to intervene on Morgan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s side, but both pointed ignore him. But when Hank, the old timer, gives Stan a look out of the corner of his eye, Stan backs down. <br/><br/>The train pulls into Moskow Station. Alice and Morgan start to get off. Stan is indignant \xe2\u20ac\u201c this station is closed! Morgan isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t allowed to get off here! But Morgan just gives him an insolent look. Stan leans in and whispers to Morgan \xe2\u20ac\u0153You\xe2\u20ac\u2122re just a loser, and you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll always be a loser,\xe2\u20ac\x9d then departs to harass some other poor soul.<br/><br/>OK, that's all for now. I'll finish the rest of session 1 later.

My goal was to give each player an opportunity to show their Issue, and (possibly more importantly) to hook each Protagonist up with someone else's Connection. This is a tried and true drama-engine, first suggested by someone on the Forge, who I now forget. But I bet it was Chris Chinn.<br/><br/>I also had a few bangs prepared, specifically Chris (Tony's character) seeing/hearing his dead mother on Alice's laptop. Via post-conflict narration in this scene and the two that followed, we were able to strongly show the audience that this mysterious woman from the 1940s is Chris's mom. "What the audience sees" is a big concern for us as we play PTA, and we're always trying to play the scenes so that the people watching at home understand what's happening. It's a kind of creative constraint that can fire the imagination.<br/><br/>By the end of this first scene (and its associated multi-way conflict), we had set up the dynamic between several characters:<br/>- Jen the commuter and Chris (she has a crush on him)<br/>- Alice and Morgan (Alice likes Morgan, but is kind of using Morgan to get free music for Alice's movie)<br/>- Stan and Morgan (Stan the security guy is Morgan's Nemesis)<br/>- Stan and Henry (Hank commands a lot of respect among the Line employees)<br/>- Henry and Alice (Henry wants his daughter to be honest with him, but she's <i>too</i> open)<br/>- Henry and the Line (he really, really wanted to get off and explore the old Moskow station, but he had a timetable to keep)<br/><br/>I tried to go to the cards as early in the scene as possible, and I think this paid off. The conflict mechanic got everyone to articulate their goals, and then narration led us in unexpected and cool directions -- especially as we tried to frame things as shots the audience was seeing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58817/#Comment_58817" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T15:19:02+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  3:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, here's the rest of the pilot episode.

She turns to address the assembled staff. Hank and Chris are both present. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Integrity. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s what the line is about.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>Doris goes on for a few minutes about the opening of the new station and how important it is. The problem is, it means more work for everybody, and The Line is understaffed as it is. Doris says that some people will be assigned to the new station. Both Hank and Chris suddenly look interested, but for very different reasons.<br/><br/>Hank speaks up, \xe2\u20ac\u0153that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s great, but what about the maintenance? Sentral needs to come through with more funding.\xe2\u20ac\x9d In their exchange, it becomes clear that Hank is trying to goad to Doris.<br/><br/>Doris goes off on Hank. \xe2\u20ac\u0153That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fine Hank, if you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re not interested in helping out, you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t need to help out. In fact, maybe you should take a little break, we can give you a cut in your hours if that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s what you need. But some of the people here could probably use a few extra hours. How about you Bob, I know you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got to kids, can you use some overtime?\xe2\u20ac\x9d By the time she\xe2\u20ac\u2122s done, Hank is totally shut down.<br/><br/>As everyone rises to leave, Doris says \xe2\u20ac\u0153and temp employees please drop off your uniforms and paperwork at the office before you leave.\xe2\u20ac\x9d All the employees except Hank and Chris file out. Chris moves off, dejected, in the opposite direction to get his paperwork.<br/><br/>As the scene ends, we see Chris cleaning out his locker. He pulls out a crumpled photo, obviously old and much handled. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the same woman that we saw in Alice\xe2\u20ac\u2122s footage.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scene 4: Moskow Station</span><br/><br/>It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Moskow station, just as we last saw it, but Mike is nowhere in sight.<br/>Morgan is ranting about Stan \xe2\u20ac\u0153Who does he think he is!\xe2\u20ac\x9d and \xe2\u20ac\u0153You\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got to fight the man.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Alice is only half listening. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, yeah, fight the man! It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s so cool you think that way; we could never afford to hire you if you were union.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Morgan is totally into her punk rock sensibilities. Alice is completely into business matters and the practicality of getting a film made.<br/><br/>Alice dials her phone, and we hear Mike\xe2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone ringing. Alice doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t hear it. Morgan follows the sound of the ringing phone.   <br/><br/>In the dark of the subway tunnel, we see the light of a cell phone display. It seems to float under its own power toward the lights of Moskow station. As it emerges into the light, we see that it is hanging from the backpack of the The Collector. The Collector, played by Tom Waits, is a sort of bag man who collects discarded items from The Line.<br/><br/>The Collector, walks into the platform. Eyeing the expensive equipment lying around, he says \xe2\u20ac\u0153You ladies shouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be here alone. This platform isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t safe. You should leave right now.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Morgan says \xe2\u20ac\u0153Is that a cell phone? I need a new phone.\xe2\u20ac\x9d <br/><br/>The Collector fumbles in his bag, looking for the phone. He pulls one out (not the one that was just ringing) and on the display we see the owner\xe2\u20ac\u2122s personal information. He is a well dressed executive named Alex who works for BMI Music. The Collector gives the phone to Morgan.<br/>Alice and Morgan leave the station through the \xe2\u20ac\u0153no admittance\xe2\u20ac\x9d door. The Collector walks to the base of the silent escalators and gazes upwards toward the light.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scene 5: Central Station</span><br/><br/>It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Central Station at rush hour. Morgan is in the background, ranting at another busker who\xe2\u20ac\u2122s moved onto her turf. Hank is just coming out an \xe2\u20ac\u0153employee\xe2\u20ac\u2122s only\xe2\u20ac\x9d door. Chris is crossing the platform.<br/><br/>A man in a black suit with a long beard and an odd, boxish hat is crossing the platform. Suddenly he grabs his heart and collapses, causing an uproar. Chris reacts immediately, pushing through the crowd to the stricken man\xe2\u20ac\u2122s side. Behind the man we see an aborigine in body paint and a loin cloth. The aborigine moves as if to help the man, but when he sees Chris he turns away instead.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hank is looking over the crowd, oblivious. He watches the inbound train empty. One of the cars is an older model. A woman gets on. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the woman from the footage. Hank looks down at a poster in his hand. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a flyer for the opening of the new station, and it has the same image: the woman in the footage. Hank hastily makes a note of the train car\xe2\u20ac\u2122s number.<br/><br/>Chris reaches the collapsed man. The mans\xe2\u20ac\u2122 relatives are shouting in a foreign language that sounds like Greek. Chris calls out. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Does anyone have some vegetable oil.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Quizzically, Morgan hands him a bottle of vegan hair pomade. Chris anoints the man\xe2\u20ac\u2122s head with the oil. He makes a blessing gesture and begins to speak in Greek. He is giving the man the last rites in the correct formula for the man\xe2\u20ac\u2122s religion. When Chris stands, the family begins to thank him tearfully.<br/><br/>The train pulls away from the platform. It is almost empty. In the last car we see a man with a beard in a black suit.<br/><br/>END CREDITS                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58821/#Comment_58821" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T15:49:41+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  3:49PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>"What the audience sees" is a big concern for us as we play PTA, and we're always trying to play the scenes so that the people watching at home understand what's happening.

John's stated goal for the scene was to show off everyone's issues. We crammed a lot in. This scene was a lot of fun to narrate, with plenty of collaborative effort involved.<br/><br/>Scene 2<br/>---------<br/>Doris (via the Producer) wants to get The Line employees excited about the new station, even though it means more work for them, and she can't offer overtime.<br/>Hank wants to annoy Doris into assigning him to the new station<br/>Chris wants to get assigned to the new station, even though he's just a temp<br/>Doris wins the conflict<br/>I think Hank won narration, but John contributed Doris' awesome put-down-Hank speech.<br/>We had a lot of trouble setting up what people wanted in this conflict, as Hank had to decide if he wanted to show that he was on Doris' side, or if their relationship was go be adversarial. All the players were lobbying for adversarial, which won out.<br/><br/>Scene 3<br/>---------<br/>The Collector wants to shoo the ladies off the platform so he can scoop some valuable stuff.<br/>I can't remember exactly what Morgan wanted, but the Collector ended up winning.<br/><br/>Scene 4<br/>---------<br/>I framed the scene up to the point of the man collapsing and introduced the conflict. John and Hank also requested some set up narration (John introduced the aborigine). The lady in the 40's outfit was added to the scene so that I could call on my connection with here (that's a spoiler *wink*).<br/>Chris wants to impress the audience and onlookers by giving the man the correct form of last rights<br/>Hank wants to correctly identify the antique train car so he can find it later<br/>Morgan was just helping<br/>I (playing Chris) won the conflict and the narration                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59452/#Comment_59452" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T23:57:14+00:00" title="March  6, 2007 11:57PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to get all PTA-technical on these for those that aren't familiar with the system (all both of you):<br/><br/>Scene 1:<br/>Brandon won his character's goal (i.e. beat the producer's draw), and Alice opened up to him (too much!).<br/>Phil won his character's goal, and Morgan stood up to Stan, but got off the train anyway.<br/>Tony lost his character's goal, and made an impression on no one.<br/>Phil had the high card, so won rubber-stamp narration authority.<br/><br/>(Player's don't beat each other; everyone draws against the producer.

As the camera pans back, we see Alice, filming out of the train using a hand-held camera. The aborigine (whose name is Matthew) appears, wearing a business suit. Speaking in accented English, he distracts Alice with a number of inane questions about her camera. As Alice is answering him, our viewpoint swoops down on the eyepiece and shoots through the camera. We see film flickering by. The film strip slows until we see individual frames. On one frame, we see a train car parked on a siding. Inside stands Mike. Suddenly, the viewpoint zooms through the camera and out the lens, zooming in to hit Mike in the forehead.<br/><br/>We\xe2\u20ac\u2122re back in the train car. With a sound like a gunshot, the car window cracks, startling everyone on the train.<br/><br/>Opening credits roll.<br/><br/>Scene 1: The newsstand in Central Station<br/><br/>Chris is getting his morning coffee, chatting with Morgan, who\xe2\u20ac\u2122s getting ready for a day of busking.  Chris\xe2\u20ac\u2122 nametag says \xe2\u20ac\u0153Methodius\xe2\u20ac\x9d. Charlie the newsstand guy holds up a copy of the paranormal zine Suppressed Transmissions. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Hey, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got one copy left, who wants it?\xe2\u20ac\x9d Both Chris and Morgan perk up. A conspicuous security camera surveils the entire scene.<br/><br/>Morgan wants the zine because there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a writup on a recent protest rally where she played, and she wants to see if she has been reviewed. Charlie\xe2\u20ac\u2122s holding it hostage, however, because he wants Morgan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s number. Chris wants it because it has the now familiar mysterious photo on the cover \xe2\u20ac\u201c the same photo he carries in his wallet. Chris tries to set up a smokescreen over his real motives, but in the argument with Morgan, the truth comes out \xe2\u20ac\u201c the woman in the photo is Chris\xe2\u20ac\u2122 mother!<br/><br/>While they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re arguing, however, Jen the commuter appears and buys the last Suppressed Transmission. She laughs at the two and taunts them as she boards the train and leaves. At that moment, the PA announces \xe2\u20ac\u0153Methodius to the main office, Methodius to the main office\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and Chris scurries away.<br/><br/>At that moment, Morgan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone rings. She answers it, and after a moment she yells into the phone \xe2\u20ac\u0153No, this is NOT Alex! You\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got the wrong phone! Stop calling me!\xe2\u20ac\x9d Then she fiddles with the phone until she manages to get it to display it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s number. She gives the number to Charlie.<br/><br/>Scene 2:  The bowels of the Line<br/><br/>Chris is on his way to Sentral Office, walking through a seeming maze of featureless antiseptic tiled hallways. Suddenly he stops, staring towards the camera with a look of utter befuddlement. The camera shifts to show his view. Some distance away at a meeting of corridors we see a wallaby. The wallaby eyes Chris for a minute, then hops down a side corridor. Chris follows.<br/><br/>At the intersection, Chris looks to see that the hall leads into a station. The Collector and the Matthew (now in aborigine garb again), are talking. The Collector is handing the aborigine a cell phone. They both look up at Chris, then part with a nod. By the time Chris gets to the platform, Collector, aborigine, and wallaby are all gone. Just then Hank appears, startling Chris. <br/>Hank: \xe2\u20ac\u0153You\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll never get to Sentral this way, Kid, follow me, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll show ya the back way.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>Chris: \xe2\u20ac\u0153Did you just see a w..\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>Hank: \xe2\u20ac\u0153A wallaby? Of course not, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s crazy!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>Chris and Hank walk back along the corridors. Hank is exhorting the bewildered Chris, setting him up against Doris, telling him to \xe2\u20ac\u0153demand his rights\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and \xe2\u20ac\u0153fight the power\xe2\u20ac\x9d, or he\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be a temp forever. Chris fights back by telling Hank that he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s seen weird stuff on the Line and he knows Hank\xe2\u20ac\u2122s seen it too. Chris wants answers.<br/><br/>We see they are in a long hallway with security cameras at the extreme ends. As they reach the point farthest from the cameras, Hank leans in and says very quietly words to the effect of \xe2\u20ac\u0153I know there are weird things going on, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve seen them too, keep your eyes open and don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t talk to anyone at Sentral about it.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>Chris and Hank continue down the hall to a trio of doors. One is marked \xe2\u20ac\u0153Sentral Office\xe2\u20ac\x9d, one is marked \xe2\u20ac\u0153Break Room\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and one is marked \xe2\u20ac\u0153Records\xe2\u20ac\x9d. Chris goes into the office. Hank makes as if to enter the break room, but as soon as he knows that nobody is observing him, he ducks into records.<br/><br/>Scene 3: The Records Room<br/><br/>Scene 3 starts out with Hank surreptitiously rifling through the records and pulling out an accident report.<br/><br/>Flashback: A much younger Hank is training Simon, a new driver on The Line. Doris is there, as well as Alice, aged about 9. Alice has a HUGE gingerbread man, almost as large as she is. Hank is giving her a speech about how she has to restrain her desire for the cookie and not eat it all at once. Doris is getting annoyed with Hank\xe2\u20ac\u2122s speech, but Hank is undeterred. Alice says she\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a big girl and she can eat her cookie if she wants. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s all getting a little tense.<br/><br/>Suddenly there is a bright light. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s another train on the track! Observant fans might realize that this is train 18, the ghost train from the pilot. Hank yells \xe2\u20ac\u0153My God! What have you done!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>The scene shifts to some moments later. There has been some kind of accident. EMTs are treating injured people on the platform and there is smoke in the air. Hank is looking around desperately for Alice. He sees her looking down the tunnel.<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153Alice, No! It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s too dangerous.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153But I want to see.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>We can see that Hank is conflicted as he orders Alice not to explore the tunnel. Alice disobeys him, inching down the tunnel. But when Hank tells her not to look, she closes her eyes and gropes around a corner. She comes up with the torso of her giant cookie. As she runs back to Hank she says \xe2\u20ac\u0153I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t look Daddy, I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>As a relieved Hank carries Alice away, Simon lurks out of the shadows. We see it is the Collector, though as a young man. He begins gathering up the shattered fragments of cookie.<br/><br/>Scene 4: Train 2442<br/><br/>Morgan and Jen are riding the train together as Morgan shows off her newly acquired phone. They\xe2\u20ac\u2122re having a blast mocking the owner of the phone. There are all sorts of music executives and celebrities, whom they proceed to crank call. Just then Alex, the phone\xe2\u20ac\u2122s owner, enters the car as Morgan hastily stashes the phone.<br/><br/>Alex greets Morgan and sits across from them,  jabbering away about how he loves to talk to the kids and find out \xe2\u20ac\u0153what\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fresh on the street.\xe2\u20ac\x9d He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s likeable, but comes off as very shallow.<br/>Jen: \xe2\u20ac\u0153Hey! You\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got to see what Morgan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s got! It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a real blast.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>We get a funny scene where Morgan tries to signal to Jen that this is Alex, the owner of the phone, while throwing up a smoke screen about a new song she\xe2\u20ac\u2122s working on. <br/><br/>Then the phone rings. The ringtone is \xe2\u20ac\u0153Who let the dogs out.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>Alex: Hey! You must have the JN600 too! Can I see it?<br/>Sheepishly, Morgan hands the phone over and Alex starts clowning around with it. He sees that a guy is calling (it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Charlie), so he decides to play around with Morgan by answering it, but it doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t take long for him to clue in that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s actually his phone. He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s livid.<br/>Alex: \xe2\u20ac\u0153You know, Morgan, maybe you think that you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re punk rock attitude means that you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re not held to the same moral standards as everyone else, but this is pretty low even for you.\xe2\u20ac\x9d After tearing into Jen and Alex for a few minutes, he storms off the train.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61484/#Comment_61484" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T22:54:59+00:00" title="March 18, 2007 10:54PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey now!

A dimly visible crowd is gathered in the dim light of torches. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s an altar and a woman facing it with her bare back to us. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a lamb tied to the altar. The woman lifts a knife and brings it down on the lamb. Then she turns, and we see it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Morgan.<br/><br/>Cut to Central Station. Chris is standing, blinking and staring at something in obvious amazement. The camera pans back and we see he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s looking at Morgan. \xe2\u20ac\u0153What?\xe2\u20ac\x9d she asks in annoyance, \xe2\u20ac\u0153What?\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/><b>Scene 1 \xe2\u20ac\u201c Charlie\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Coffee Stand</b><br/><br/>Morgan is at the coffee stand with a sheaf of flyers for her upcoming show. She\xe2\u20ac\u2122s trying to convince Charlie to hang her posters at the coffee stand but Charlie\xe2\u20ac\u2122s giving her heck because he still thinks she gave him a bogus phone number. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Look Charlie, just let me hang up the posters. You let everyone else do it.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Hank, on break, offers to hang up the posters for her.<br/><br/>Stan the security guard enters. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Posters? That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a violation of section III, paragraph b of the transit code.\xe2\u20ac\x9d There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a cool scene where Hank and Stan face off. Stan tries look like he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s in control while simultaneously trying to read the posted list of station rules that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s posted behind his own head. Hank faces Stan down because Stan doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know what he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s talking about.<br/><br/>Morgan: Hey Charlie, just because that phone number didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t work out\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>Charlie: Oh, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re bringing up the phone number, oh good.<br/><br/>Charlie challenges Morgan to go on t a date with him, expecting to be shot down. To his surprise she accepts. Hank leaves with the posters. We see that they depict a lamb enclosed in a box in some kind of industrial meat processing plant.<br/><br/><b>Scene 2 \xe2\u20ac\u201c Commuter Platform</b><br/><br/>On a near empty commuter platform, Chris is putting up a roll of huge Diesel Jeans ads. He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not wearing a transit uniform (i.e. he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s temping for the poster company now). A stranger (\xe2\u20ac\u0153The Inspector\xe2\u20ac\x9d) wearing a soviet looking uniform and a long coat is ticking off items in a worn black note pad. His uniform is perfectly pressed and cleaned, but also very threadbare and quite old. Hank arrives on his train (currently out of service) and a sheaf of posters.<br/><br/>Hank is surprised to see the Inspector, but the conversation is surreal and hard to follow. The entire time, the Inspector is looking over the train and the platform, making notations in his book:<br/>Hank: Do you remember the accident?<br/>Inspector. Yes, remember. You are to Moscow?<br/>Hank: Do you remember train 2442?<br/>Inspector: Old station.<br/>Hank: My daughter was there. You remember?<br/>Inspector: Yes, I am to film for her. We go to Moscow?<br/><br/>Hank convinces the inspector to come with him to the old station.  Chris tries to tag along, but Hank can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t seem to remember who Chris is (though the Inspector, ironically, calls him by name). Morgan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s posters are left on the platform to be blown across the floor by the next train.<br/><br/><b>Scene 4 \xe2\u20ac\u201c Sentral Office</b><br/><br/>Stan is talking to a bored Doris, giving a speech about how \xe2\u20ac\u0153it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s chaos out there\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and \xe2\u20ac\u0153I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m the thin blue line\xe2\u20ac\x9d. Doris points out that Stan seems to spend all his time trying to bust Morgan without any success. Chris, who has been listening at the door, pushes his way in and gives a speech of his own. He knows weird stuff is going on. Hank\xe2\u20ac\u2122s up to something and Sentral isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t on top of it. They need someone on the inside, someone who can be invisible. Chris offers to become Doris\xe2\u20ac\u2122 spy on the line, in return for a job in the mysterious new station. Stan tries to get in on the action, suggesting that he should be Chris\xe2\u20ac\u2122 mentor.<br/><br/>Stan: The kid can benefit from my, whadyacallit, sagaciousness.<br/>Doris: Yes, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m sure you have a plethora of sagaciousness.<br/>Stan: Better than that, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got two!<br/><br/>Doris agrees to give Chris his job and the pick of assignments if he can find out more about what Hank\xe2\u20ac\u2122s up to. The scene ends as the camera zooms back, shifting to grainy black and white, and we finish by looking at the video display of a security camera looking into Doris\xe2\u20ac\u2122 office.<br/><br/><b>Scene 4 \xe2\u20ac\u201c A Platform</b><br/><br/>Morgan and Jen are on a train platform, while Morgan bemoans how she messed up her friendship with Alex. Morgan is selectively defacing up a Diesel Jean\xe2\u20ac\u2122s advertisement, turning into an impromptu work of art. Suddenly Alex rushes up to Morgan and brandishes his cell phone. \xe2\u20ac\u0153You\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve GOT to tell me, where did you get this!\xe2\u20ac\x9d He plays a recorded message and we hear didgeridoo music over the sound of a train rumbling.<br/><br/>Alex is talking at high speed. \xe2\u20ac\u0153This is the new sound we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been looking for\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and \xe2\u20ac\u0153the president of the company is in town tonight. I want you to play for him\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and \xe2\u20ac\u0153this is your big break, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got a contract ready for you!\xe2\u20ac\x9d Morgan keeps trying to break in and explain that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not her sound, that she didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t steal his cell phone, and so on.<br/><br/>Morgan: It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s NOT my big break, Alex, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s YOUR big break. This isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t my sound. This isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t me or what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m about.<br/>Alex: OK, sure. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m sorry. I made a mistake. I thought that you and me, we could be a team, but I was wrong. Here, have the phone, I already replaced it anway.<br/><br/>Alex leaves, obvious hurt and unhappy.<br/><br/><b>Scene 5 \xe2\u20ac\u201c The Dreamtime</b><br/><br/>Morgan is cutting down the tracks in a tunnel between stations when she hears the sound of digeridoo. She tries to trace the sound down a side tunnel. Far ahead we see a faint blue light near the floor. As Morgan approaches her phone rings. She looks down. The caller ID says \xe2\u20ac\u0153Mike\xe2\u20ac\x9d. She looks up and runs to the light. Mike is lying on the tracks. The light is his cell phone, which is clutched in his lifeless hand. Morgan bends down and starts trying to lift him up. We hear a train\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/><br/>Morgan tries to lift up Mike, but it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s no longer Mike on the tracks, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a bleating lamb.<br/>Morgan looks down the track. We see an oncoming train.<br/>Morgan looks down the track. We see a room full of people chanting Morgan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s name. It looks like a rock concert, except there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s an altar on the stage.<br/>Now there seem to be two Morgans. One is hefting the lamb onto the altar. The other is staring, terrified at the train.<br/>Morgan <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> lifts the knife. We see Mike on the altar looking up at her. She looks over and meets the other Morgan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s eyes. They nod. <br/>Morgan <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> turns to face the train, unafraid. Morgan <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> plunges the knife down, cutting the bonds that hold the lamb to the altar. The train seems to pass through and over them. As it pulls away, we see Chris in the caboose.<br/><br/><b>Scene 6 \xe2\u20ac\u201c Hank\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Train</b><br/><br/>It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the grand (re)opening of Moscow platform. Dignitaries are awaiting the arrival of the first train, Hank\xe2\u20ac\u2122s train. The scene shifts to the train. Chris is driving. Hank is supervising. Hank has a very satisfied look on his face, and we clearly see the Inspector\xe2\u20ac\u2122s notebook is now in Hank\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pocket. Hank is explaining to Chris how Moscow platform has an odd intersection of tracks. \xe2\u20ac\u0153It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s complicated \xe2\u20ac\u0153.<br/><br/>Suddenly Hank and Chris scream and put up their hands. Morgan is on the track! As the train seems to pass over her without doing any damage, Hank and Chris are totally flustered. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Did you just see that? Was that real?\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>The cab suddenly fills with light. We see the ghost train on the same track bearing down on them. We see a flash of the broken gingerbread man. Hank\xe2\u20ac\u2122s hand comes down on a big red button labeled \xe2\u20ac\u0153release\xe2\u20ac\x9d. Chris raises his hands reflexively. The cab of Hank\xe2\u20ac\u2122s train surges forward, released from the other cars as the ghost train merges on to the track behind it, missing the cab. The ghost train plows into the remaining cars, empty for the inaugural run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
