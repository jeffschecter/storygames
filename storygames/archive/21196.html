That is why if you google "scene framing" the only results you get are from The Forge, Story Games, and related satellites. I believe the expression was first used in the late '90s, either in the game "Story Engine" or "Theatrix," I don't remember which. Ron expanded the concept in "Sorcerer &amp; Sword," after which "scene framing" became a major and common topic of investigation at the Forge in the early 2000s. <br/><br/>Here are some interesting Forge threads that the OP may find useful:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=69" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=69</a><br/><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=227.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=227.0</a><br/><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=313.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=313.0</a><br/><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/reference/index.php/welcome/topic/1361" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indie-rpgs.com/reference/index.php/welcome/topic/1361</a> &lt;- Particularly this one!<br/><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/index.php?topic=25584.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indie-rpgs.com/index.php?topic=25584.0</a><br/><br/>I think it's illuminating to keep in mind the historical context of these discussions: in the '90s, the default approach to conducting a game was the pre-planned sequence of encounters, often totally linear. Each encounter was a little sandbox for the PCs to romp around in until they "beat" it (by winning this or that combat, or acquiring this or that clue), which triggered the next encounter. At no point was the GM in the dark about what the next encounter might be. Scene framing at the time consisted solely of statements amounting to "You travel to / find yourself in the next encounter location."<br/><br/>The main contribution of the Forge discussions was twofold: First, scene framing could be done *improvisationally* during play, in response to and in collusion with the contributions of the players. Second, scene framing was a skill. We could get better at doing it, and thereby enhance our experience of play. <br/><br/>There's a lot of good scene framing stuff spread around Sorcerer &amp; Suppliments as well as Dogs in the Vinyard and other games, but IMO the 2013 rewrite of Trollbabe is the best treatment, tying everything together in one useful place. I haven't seen a better one, anyway. <br/><br/>-N<br/><br/>P.S., Maybe this is the thread Jeff was looking for?

Of course, this means owning a lot of games and for some this is not a financial priority or an expense they can afford.  If this is the case, I suggest exploring free games of this nature, and comparing them. And hopefully you, or others, can find something useful on Google <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>(I'm not sure where the message thread is about Scene Framing that I thought I saw.

Because it's not official, and therefore can create confusion as it is a bit of a strech.<br/><br/>For example, as a comic artist scene framing means something for me, similar to what it does in writing: the author is setting a mood and establishing other things, like where the action will happen, who's there and the initial premise for the action. Of course, we don't use the term "scene framing" officially in comics, we call it "establishing shot", but any artist will understand you if you use "scene framing" in this context anyway.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464459/#Comment_464459" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T17:59:04+00:00" title="June 29, 2017  5:59PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2017 6:01PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/paganini" rel="nofollow">paganini</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Hey <a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">@Jeff_B_Slater</a>, maybe it was this post of Vincent's from Google+?<br/><br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/+VincentBaker/posts/hreaAFy1GE8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/+VincentBaker/posts/hreaAFy1GE8</a><br/><br/>-N</p></div></blockquote>\nIt wasn't this post, but it referred to Vincent's G+ post in it, not joking.

I don't think the term 'framing' itself is often used, but the various component parts of what we mean by framing when talking about games are often discussed: how to select a who, where, when, what, and why which will make a good scene, and how to begin and end it in an effective manner.<br/><br/>Resource-wise, <i>Story</i> by Robert McKee has some good stuff about scene framing. I particularly recommend <i>Into the Woods</i> by John Yorke which talks very clearly about how scene structure imitates a truncated form of an overall story structure.<br/><br/>The most intresting scene framing advice I've seen for games specifically is in <i>Microscope</i>. You're meant to ask a question of the scene and play out the scene merely to answer it, e.g. Why does the captain decide to crash the ship on purpose? I think this is brilliant because it accepts that the plot conclusion (as it were) of a given scene/story is often foregone and encourages you to think about what actually makes the scene interesting.<br/><br/>At the table, the questions I ask myself when framing a scene are:-<br/>- Which story thread has been neglected recently?<br/>- What basics are needed to move that story forward?<br/>- How might the scene challenge and surprise the focus character?<br/><br/>I often find (especially with Fiasco) that players in general have more difficulty knowing when to *end* scenes than they do with establishing them. That's another reason why <i>Microscope</i>'s scene questions are interesting, because they define the edges of a scene mostly in terms of how it will end. In a sense, that's closer to screenwriting where the importance of a scene is heavy end-weighted towards its climax; in another, it's further away from screenwriting because the scene is freed from a need to contribute to an ongoing story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465002/#Comment_465002" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-24T20:43:56+00:00" title="July 24, 2017  8:43PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.<br/><br/>"Framing" a scene requires situating the scene in time and space, and starting it in the appropriate manner/way. Then it also requires knowing when to end, cut, or close the scene - equally important.<br/><br/>(Although I find that in RPG dialogue, "framing" generally refers to the opening of the scene.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
