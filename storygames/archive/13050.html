One side determines who gets clue points and the other determines who narrates.<br/>\n  If you want to play it on line, you can use this software:<br/>\nhttp://www.vassalengine.org/download.php<br/>\nThis is free, java-based, multi-platform and games are hosted on their server, so you don't have to much with firewalls and ports.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this module:<br/>\nhttp://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Piecepack<br/>\nThis module will let you use text chat, dice, dominoes, tokens and play them anywhere on the virtual table.<br/>\nDave M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
