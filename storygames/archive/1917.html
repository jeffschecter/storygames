                    I have read and seen some things around Story Games, the Forge and generally the indie rpg scene that have got me wondering. There has been all this talking about "gaming the system hard", "narrativist game design" and the combination of both making awesome things happen. There was this discussion where Ron Edwards was telling people that yes, guess what, you can just give in a Dogs conflict because you like the other outcome better now, even though you were winning. And people go like: "Really? Wow, thanks for that insight!"<br/>
<br/>
Some time ago I started a discussion on Vincent's blog about reward system, but then could not follow up for real life reasons. Still I am having a feeling that people who have been exposed to Forge theory for a while tend to overrate reward system. I have the feeling that some people check out a new game, identify the reward system and then drive for the reward as hard as they can, no matter what, expecting the game system to deliver great fictional output. Or if it's not the reward, then it's something else the system tells you to do. And if a system doesn't tell you what to do, it's broken. Maybe that impression is just dead wrong.<br/>
<br/>
This goes along with the "play by the book" mantra and the "Rule Zero sucks" mantra. I think that Mike Holmes is taking a lead on this with the discussions he has started lately. I have seen more than one Forge-style game break because people were trying too hard to guess how the game was <i>supposed</i> to run, instead of just leaving it be and playing the way they liked. "The designer knows better than we do", seems to be the reasoning. And if it's not fun, well, at least we got someone to blame.<br/>
<br/>
As you may have guessed by now, I do not find much sense and merit in thinking and acting that way. But hey, maybe I'm just seeing things that aren't there.<br/>
<br/>
So, do you really believe in game systems so strongly? Do you really believe that a game should tell the players exactly what to do, should be played exactly as written, and should work better for you that way than any other? If the game is not fun after an hour, will you rather keep playing by the rules or quit, than just change the rules? Because, frankly, I am wondering why anybody would.                </div>

                            I'd say that yes, I believe system is that important.  Though, if you play the game as written and it's not fun for you, and then maybe you double-check to be sure that you're doing it "right" and it's still not fun for you, then either it isn't a well designed game, or it's just not the game for you.  From there, feel free to change the rules as a group to suit your needs.  Sort of a "better to have the system and not need it than to need the system and not have it" situation.<br><br>So yes, though I suppose slavishly adhering to the system after you know it doesn't work for you is bad, the system is the place to start until you know.<br><br>IMO                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Depends. <br><br>Am I talking as a player looking at a game I want to play, or a designer thinking about the quality and structure of a game I want to build? Am I talking about a game in the abstract of how good I think it is as a critic, or in the way it actually helps me (or hinders) me from having fun at the table? Am I using the game as an example of theory, or am I using theory to help me understand the game? <br><br>Because I think a lot of the static that we get around this issue is from people over conflating those things.<br/><br/>This also goes with my observation that I think that some members of our extended community of swine are more empowered as designers than they are as players.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hey Brand, there might be some conflating going on, but the argument is still there even if you sort that out.<br/>
<br/>
There is one point at the level of "this group, this evening", which is about the players at the table right there looking at the game system to tell them what to do.<br/>
<br/>
There is another point at the level of "this game system, in general", which is about judging a game system primarily by how well it "drives" into a certain direction.                        </div>

                            Frank, <br><br>Yep. And those two points weigh heavily upon each other. <br><br>But they aren't actually the same point, as you've shown by dividing them out. <br/><br/>However, many people answer the as though they were exactly the same in all cases. Which leads to the "anti-systemists" to saying that there is no "drive" in a game ever, because they aren't looking at the metalevel, and "pro-systemists" saying that only the drive matters because they undervalue the microlevel. <br/><br/>They answer one as though the answer to it is automatically the answer to the other. <br/><br/>Thus, conflating.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Yes. It's an <em>impossible</em> standard, but as a designer it's something to aim for, and as a player it's something to hope for. Realistically all games fall short, but the less short they fall, the better.</p>

                            Hey Frank,<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">If the game is not fun after an hour, will you rather keep playing by the rules or quit, than just change the rules? Because, frankly, I am wondering why anybody would.</span><br/><br/>This is a complex question. Typically I don't change rules mid-session. And if a game is a playtest of someone's rules-in-development, I always want a solid experience with the rules-as-written, as a basis for subsequent conversation with the designer, before introducing changes. So if it's a one-session playtest, typically we play by the rules until there's consensus to end the game and discuss issues. But if it's a planned multi-session game, well, we pretty commonly implement rules changes between sessions. <br/><br/>It's definitely problematic. As a designer, it's frustrating to me if playtesters ignore what I think are key rules, or make changes before playing out a complete reward cycle. But as a designer, one of the reasons I'm so engaged with playtesting other designers' games is for the opportunities they represent to learn and get better and better at fixing design issues without having to repeatedly create whole broken games to do so.<br/><br/>So, I dunno...yes, I think system matters. And I think giving in DitV <em>is</em> gaming the system. You give not only because you find the outcome dramatically satisfying, but also because part of playing the game is picking your battles, and the potential fallout you'll incur by not giving doesn't seem worth it once you see what the opposition is after as the outcome in question. You give in order to save your effectiveness for the conflicts you know you really care about.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

                            Ok, before we enter into the argument, let me stress that phrase Shreyas quoted, and especially that bit about the system telling the players <i>exactly</i> what to do. The part with "telling people what to do" can come in very different guises, be abstract or conrete, rooted in the fiction or rooted in the interactions between the real people. It may be achieved through hard procedural rules ("frame a scene"), or through rewards ("you get a token if..."), or through some other nifty designer's toy.<br/>
<br/>
Argument starts now. I am not claiming that any of the above features of a game system are bad. Depending on how they are used, they can be great tools. But what I am claiming is that the idea of a game system <i>making </i>players behave in a certain way is problematic, and the idea that the <i>main criterion</i> for judging the quality of a game system should be how well it does this is just plain wrong.<br/>
<br/>
As with all discussion of such issues, it suffers from the fact that everyone is argueing from the very limited database of their own experience. Bear with me. In my experience, with any shared creative endeavor, and with role-playing especially, inspiration and opportunity are what sets creative energy free. Telling people what to do isn't. There is no such thing as a "creativity manual".<br/>
<br/>
So, a player turning to the game system to tell her what to do seems upside down to me. The game system should ask the player what she wants it to do. Give her some idea of what it can and cannot do, for sure. But the idea of the "perfectly oiled machine Forge game" that produces great fun play by just running the formula is, in my humble opinion, a myth and not an ideal to which to aspire.<br/>

                            Paul: Yes, I understand about the playtesting. That is something else because fun is not the primary goal.<br/>
<br/>
About Dogs: I was refering espescially to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21775.msg222924#msg222924" rel="nofollow">this post</a> by Ron. Sure, everybody understands giving in a conflict because there's some d10 fallout on the line. What people have a hard time with, strangely, is giving in a conflict where you could win easily, and without mechanical drawback. Here is the key quote:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">What if I don't like my Dog any more? He or she is a son of a bitch, and I don't even want to go through any kind of repentance or redemption in my mind - the character went too far, and I am responsible. OK, in a later shooting-based conflict in which I am playing the Dog the same old way, bam! I Give. The Dog dies. And a damn good thing ("nothing in his life became him as well as the leaving of it," I'm probably butchering that quote).<br/>
<br/>
Or a positive one works perfectly too. The Dog argues with the steward to quit being such a prideful dick and causing all these problems. They roll! The Dog's dice suck. The GM sits in judgment of the Dog - "he's right. He's just right. The only way the steward would continue is if he's a psychopath, and he's not." And Gives, hence providing his judgment of the Dog's commitment. (This example exactly parallels the use of the Sincerity die in My Life with Master; it is not a fudge or a gimme - it's a judgment.)</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
But that's just one example of how it's not the game system telling the players what to do, but the other way round.                        </div>

                            This is a great topic, Frank.<br><br>I think a designer is responsible for providing procedures for the things that are critical and equally responsible for not providing procedures for things that aren't.  TSOY is a great example of this - there's nothing in the rules about who says what, when.  Nothing about how much authority the GM has in creating challenges.  That stuff is left to the individual group  to decide, and every group brings its own standards to those issues.  Conversely, if you want your character to fall in love, TSOY tells you exactly how to do that - no discussion; it's quite clear.  <br><br>I've had some trouble with this lately - over-designing a little, trying to force my game to provide an experience that in some way is consistent and meets certain goals I have that are really my own outside of the design.  Happily it's pretty easy to pare it down and let the system breathe a little, but it's been an important lesson for me.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
1) If you are slavishly following the rules and not having fun, the game is either broken or not meant for you. Quit playing.<br/>
<br/>
2) If the game does not tell you exactly what you are supposed to do in order to have fun, the designer hasn't done his job properly.<br/>

I have heard this argument on the web many times, and seen at least one person ruining several convention games with trying to teach players how to "play [game name] right".                        </div>

Paul: Thank you! As it were, the core idea of BARBAREN is more than two years old, and this thinking about game mechanics is something I have been arriving at within the last half-year or so. I do think BARBAREN is not too tight, "breathes" as Jason so fittingly called it, but it is not designed with the explicit goal of framing a space for "actual honest player value judgements". There, we are talking about my "perfect game", which is no more than a working title and a few notes at this moment.                        </div>

                            Frank,<br><br>My take on this topic is that game systems can't *make* you do anything.  They can and should encourage and facilitate some desired mode of play.  How narrowly should they focus on encouraging/facilitating a single mode of play?  That's a question for the designer to answer for each game.  I think Dogs in the Vineyard would be a weaker game if it had a broader focus than it does.  However the basic rules are flexible enough that those players who have wanted to use the rules for other things have been pretty successful at modifying the game to suit their needs.  Look at Afraid and The Princes' Kingdom and other DitV spinoffs.  That's an excellent game design.  It tells the player exactly how to play and facilitates that play.  But the mechanics are interesting enough and flexible enough to modify to do other things with relative ease, should you want to do that.                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>I believe in game systems EXACTLY insofar as they let me do something cool that I couldn't do myself.</blockquote>
As an example of this, I've stopped focusing on games that make heavy use of flags in the one-on-one games I play with Mo. We talk about everything ad nauseum, and we usually start talking about game an hour before we start play, we live together and we communicate everything. So flags to help us know what the other wants out of game aren't really all that useful. <br/><br/>OTOH, when I'm playing with near-strangers that I just met through the Toronto Indie Gamers Club, I'm not going to GM a game that doesn't have flags. Because, you know, my ability to know what my wife wants from game and my ability to know what Erik WhomIJustMetToday wants is going to be radically different, and need different systems.                        </div>

                            Hi Gaerik,<br/>
<br/>
In my book, Dogs does not at all tell the players what to. It drops the characters into an interesting, morally challenging situation and asks, "What do you do?" I once listened to someone explaining to other people that they were playing Dogs "wrong" because they were "just playing their characters" and not "making a personal judgement". For one thing, I believe that was a stupid thing to say. But my point here is that you can play Dogs the way you want. If you, the GM, want to have three demon riders attack in a storm, you can. If you want the characters to help build a barn and get a chance for romance, you can. Whereever you go from the starting point, the game can handle it.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, there are a few things it doesn't handle that well. That bit about entering an already begun conflict, for example, which Vincent fixed for Afraid. Or these all-or-nothing, multi-participant conflicts with 200 dice on the table that seem to drag on forever and then spawn like four healing conflicts. But the Fruitful Void is there, and it's not only <i>how</i> you judge, it's also <i>if</i> you judge at all.<br/>
<br/>
Or let's talk about My Life with Master. I listened too much to that stuff about "gaming the system hard", and when I actually played the game, I was kind of thinking that it was my job as a player to make as many ouvertures as possible, and always try to get the sincerety die if at all possible, and so forth. Which is, as I see it now, much closer to playing the game "wrong" than "just playing your character". More precisely, it's not fun, at least not to me. I should have based my decisions and actions much more on the fictional situation and much less on the perceived reward system (especially because I wasn't getting the implications of the numbers on the epilogue anyway).<br/>

                            I don't buy or read games for the rules. To be honest, slogging through ANOTHER game system is absolutely the least enjoyable part. I may get vilified for this but this delayed me reading through "A Conpsiracy of Shadows" and "The Mountain Witch". TCoS was a good read after the fact and I'm glad I made the effort. TMW - well - frankly it's 90% rules and that made it much less an enjoyable read - put it like this - Bushido was more fun to read and had greater scope. The innovative bit, Trust, was nicked from somewhere else. These days if a rule set cannot explain itself in less than 5 pages then I "get the ump" with it.<br><br>I see the "indie theorism" as being a push back from the d20/OGL debacle. For years system was not something that people fussed about and people copied systems hither and thither. Then one side makes it licensed and the other side, the indies, start their own holy crusade.<br><br>I'm a story bigot. I play with people who just like to have fun. System, especially systems which encourage a lot of system mechanic play (DitV, Don't Rest Your Head), bore the utter shit out of me. That said - I want to play in the world of DitV. That interests me                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I believe you're referring to me in your posts (at least partly), so I thought I'd try to explaing my view on this. My reasoning for hewing close to the rules, is that I want different games to give me different gaming experiences. I already know how to run "ye olde schoole"-RPGs, i.e. how to get the kind of gaming experience that comes with D&amp;D-type games. If I pick up a new game, I want it to feel different and play differently from the games I already have. When I play a new game, I'm not interesting in doing things that I already know are fun to me. I want to do things that are new and different to me. Vincent has already phrased this much better than I could.<br><br>My first few attempts with Primetime Adventures were frustrating and boring, because the players did exactly the things you proposed. They did the things they knew they enjoyed from previous games, and tried to get the rules to help them with it. They were basically trying to play PtA the same way they'd play Shadowrun or DSA. Which makes me wonder, why pick a new and different game to play, when what you really want is to play your old game? I don't subscribe to the theory, that once you know how to have fun with one RPG, you know how to have fun with all of them. I think that people simply learn how to mould RPGs to their preferences, which is not the same as actually playing the game.<br/><br/>Playing a new game is a bit like driving a car. In the end it's about getting to where you want quick and comfortably (i.e. having a good time). You can either mould it as you see fit (i.e. getting the bus) or you can stick to the rules (i.e. learn to drive). I prefer to stick to the rules, which is ironic, because in real life I rather use public transportation than bother to get a driver's licence.<br/><br/>So, no. I don't think looking at the rules to understand how to play the game is wrong. Nor is expecting the game to be straight-forward and explicit in what it can do and how it does it. But most of all, I don't think that sticking to the rules or not sticking to the rules will necessairly lead to people having fun with a game.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hi Georgios,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I was refering to you among many others. Please note that I'm not saying you should play PtA the same way you would play Shadowrun or D&amp;D. But many people here, on the Forge and at GroFaFo have been advising beginners to really drive for Conflict (in the mechanical sense) as hard as they can, and always try to link these conflicts to the Issues. Which is exactly what I'm talking about: You are trying to guess what the system wants you to do, and then you are pushing hard to do that.<br/>
<br/>
What I keep repeating is that it's no big deal if you only have a conflict in every third scene. It's no big deal if your issue doesn't come up at all in an episode where you are at Screen Presence 2. If it's a good show, a show you would like to watch on TV, then you are fine. PtA provides very good tools for this exact thing. But it is not the game system that builds the show. It is you. And if you try too hard to do what you think the system wants you to do, you may end up in creative dead ends.<br/>

                            Aside to Georgios: As you were guessing, I was also refering to you as the guy who told people they were playing Dogs "wrong". That was on last GroFaFo rally. I do think it was a stupid thing to say because you were essentially telling them to care. No one cares because they are told to. You were the GM, if you wanted to make them care, your tools were right in front of you--but no game system can do that job for you, not even Dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm not saying you suck as a GM. With that group and in that context, I probably couldn't have made them care any better. Still, telling them to care was only making things worse, as they were already frowning.<br/>
<br/>
That was a bit of explanation that was probably in place. As for the discussion, Paul already nailed it for me:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Choices shouldn't always be resource management no-brainers. And it's not enough just to force players to handle creative constraints. Yes, both of these produce the semblance of value judgements. But for truly powerful drama, you need actual honest player value judgements.</div>
</blockquote>
That's it. And also consider: Sometimes you do something that is explicitly punished by the rules, and because it is being punished and you choose to do it anyway, it really matters.                        </div>

                            Frank,<br><br>We may be talking about different things because I've read Dogs several times and it is pretty explicit in the text at telling the reader what to do and how to play the game.  Now it doesn't tell the reader what to do within the realm of the fiction but it has lots of instructions on what to do when playing.  I mean the GM section is nothing but telling the GM precisely what to do.  "Drive towards conflict.", "Escalate, Escalate, Escalate!", "Actively reveal the town."; all of these and their following explainations are telling the GM (a player) what to do.  The other players at the table get less rigorous instructions but at least one thing the text instructs is for the players to pass judgement.  They aren't there to kill things and take their stuff.  They aren't there to celebrate the old west.  They are there to pass judgement and deal with the fallout.  <br><br>However, from reading your argument again I'm thinking that perhaps these kinds of instructions might not be what you're talking about.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi Frank,
<blockquote>So, do you really believe in game systems so strongly? Do you really believe that a game should tell the players exactly what to do, should be played exactly as written, and should work better for you that way than any other?

I see this as the converse:  A game should <i>be able</i> to tell the players exactly what to do, should <i>be able</i> to be played exactly as written, and should  <i>work better</i> that way than any other. Of course I will stop playing with or modify rules that are causing suck in may gamage. But "system matters" is a call to write games that don't have to be overhauled or drastically customized in order to be playable <i>as is</i>.  Then customizability, as in TSoY, can be a feature rather than a bug. <br><br>This matters especially to me because I want to play and write games that don't require specialized knowledge or training in order to be played, which is how I see gming often function. One has to add "a good gm" to many games in order to be able to have fun playing them. If you don't have one, then what? If you can instead write good procedures that let everyone be able to contribute in ways that the "good gm" would have, then you have a stronger game. The secret of Dogs is that anyone can be a good gm if you follow the rules when playing the game. Hence, more fun for more folks. <br><br>Maybe I should say "anyone has a greater possiblity of being a good gm in Dogs regardless of their prior experience", but you get the drift.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I disagree. I don't consider performing, as in putting on a great show for the players, part of the GM's job. Certainly not in Dogs. Thus, I don't need to make them care. It's certainly one of the things, a GM can do to add to the experience. But even if the players don't care about what's going on in the town, they still have a job to do. They still have to keep the community together. Not caring is ultimately just as much of a value judgement as empathising with everybody is.<br><br>As for playing Dogs wrong, I still stand by that. I think that focussing only on acting in-character, as opposed to passing judgement, is playing DITV wrong. In the sense of wasting the potential of what the game can do and is designed to do. Much like buying a tricked-out high-end PC and only using it to do 4th-grade math homework, is using that PC wrong. It gets the job done, but it's a bloody waste.<br/><br/>But, please, do cut me some slack. That was the very first time I've run DITV. I was still trying to feel my way into the game. Which seems to be what you're arguing against. 
<blockquote>Still, telling them to care was only making things worse, as they were already frowning.</blockquote>
Well.. I just don't feel the emotional manipulation of people, to help them enjoy a game more is really the way to go. If the players don't care, they don't care. The demons win, the community suffers. They have to choose to care. I cannot "make" them, I can only remind them. Just as I cannot make them believe in the King of Life or in the existence of demons.                        </br></br></div>

<br/>
That, there, is the myth, or what I think is a myth anyway. That is what I am trying to get at with this thread. The idea is pretty good, in abstract. It sounds reasonable. It works if some highly sensitive, experienced and creative people like many of the people who post here pick it up. But it is still the people who are making it work. This is almost a mirror of what Mike Holmes said at the Forge a few days ago.<br/>
<br/>
Really, you can't get fun role-playing that really engages people by just running down a formula. Of course you can provide good tools and reasonable advice, which I am not in any way disencouraging. But I sense a danger in saying "the system does it all for you" and "just follow the instructions". Because if people inhale that mantra, they start to really believe in the system so strongly that they would rather follow the system's lead than their own intuition.<br/>
<br/>
In order for play to be really rewarding, the players have to actively contribute a part of themselves, creatively and socially. Thus, they get engaged by the fiction and the social dynamic at the table. I don't think you'll normally get there by just following an instruction. Or that has at least been my experience.<br/>

                            I'm pissed off. How about some intellectual honesty around here? Never have I said that a game design will <i>make </i>anyone play a certain way or have a good time. I've never described reward systems as little breadcrumbs that people follow in order to have a programmed good time.<br/>
<br/>
Frank, the quote you referred to, by me, does not reflect the bizarre, mechanical, slavish approach that you are seem to be ascribing to me. It also illustrates that the reward system in Dogs is <i>not</i> merely to apply Fallout (which is a minor mechanic within it), but to conclude a moral judgment of the player's upon the actions of the Dog which that same player directed in the first place. This is a game about reflection upon actions, even if you believed ("knew") you were right when you did them.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I agree with what you just posted, but I want you to recognize that <i>you </i>are agreeing with <i>me</i>.<br/>
<br/>
What Emily said is what I've been saying since I first posted System Does Matter in 1999. I've never said anything different. <i>Because </i>I said it, over a hundred games are now available that would never otherwise have found the support and context for their production. I want the God damn credit for this, thank you very much.<br/>

                            Oh.<br/>
<br/>
In that case, I totally support your point and appreciate your using my quote.<br/>
<br/>
I also think everything I just posted applies double to a whole bunch of people who are not you, so I'll point to it anyway and stand by it. Gesturing.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is, Georgios isn't one of them either. He ran an awesome PTA game when I was visiting, and the three of us (me, you, him) had a lot of fun with the brief bit of Sorcerer, I thought. It seems to me that in practice, and speaking mainly on the basis of having played these games with you guys, that you and Georgios are a lot closer together in goals and basic methods than you're different.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes saying "you have to care" is a good signal to people who <i>do</i> care, or would, but didn't realize that was going to be valued by the GM or anyone else. Or other times, it can be interpreted as a direct and inappropriate order by people who don't. It's kind of a crapshoot, especially at venue like the GroFaFo rally. So I'm inclined to cut Georgios plenty of slack.<br/>

Best, Ron                        </div>

                            When I said "system matters" I meant specifically the essay by Ron.  My words, en toto, are just paraphrasing that.

I'll repeat: <i>anyone has a greater possiblity of being a good gm in Dogs regardless of their prior experience if they use the procedures in the book</i>. And add: <i>using these procedures involves one's own innate creativity, inspiration, interpretation and insight--but they are more complete and useful than many found elsewhere</i>. <br><br>In my experience.                        </br></br></div>

                            One extra thought, <br><br>I think that a lot of this discussion, in a real way, has to do more with how we talk about games and game theory than how we actually play it. Because my experiences playing with folks from the community (online or face to face) isn't that they play in some slavish way - even when they talk about the theoretical side with stern realism. (Which, its important to note, doesn't mean that they're being hypocrites in any way or not playing the way they're designing, but just that the different contexts yield different discourses.) <br><br>Also, I have to wonder how much of what we're talking about edges around the fruitful void issue. Gaming the system is one thing, but expecting the game to fill the void (or playing a game that does so, which I think some games have done) for you is another.<br><br>Edit due to cp with Emily: I'll agree with what Emily just said 100%. I'll also add, in my ego, that I'm a better Dogs GM than most that I know because, well I AM MADE OF AWESOME. But even the worst GM that I know can run a game of Dogs and have it be passable -- which I can't say for them running, say, Exalted. It isn't about what a game can do with people who are made of awesome, its about what a game can do with people who are just people.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            My apollogies for any trouble that this has caused. That is, I think that Frank was spurred on somehow by my Does System Matter thread at the Forge (I can't think of what other "work" he's discussing). But all I can say is that any developments here, correct or incorrect, do not seem to me in any way to have to do with what I was posting about over there. Or at least not what I was intending to discover. I can completely understand how I may have miscommunicated to people, given the oblique angle from which I came at the subject matter - no fault on Frank's part for thinking I was saying something other than what I was.<br/>
<br/>
Let me make one thing as clear as possible, that thread was supposed to be a call for data and perspectives on the subject, and in no way had any conclusions in mind. Even if the hypothesis turned out to be true, I don't draw any conclusions from that.<br/>
<br/>
That said, good work on discovering some common ground here, despite the possibly tainted source.<br/>

Good to see you back about Em.<br/>

<p>I never understand that argument.</p>
<p>The more complete a workshop is, the more tools there are to use. That means you can make things that are better and make more kinds of things, not the opposite. <em>Game rules are ways to say something, not something to say.</em></p>
<p>If you don't want to use the tools at your disposal â€” particularly the ones with techniques that have been demonstrated by their designers and other users to be effective at what you want â€” then that's your prerogative. When you kit out a game, change stuff around, add in techniques from other games, mess around with its reward system and such, you're changing the game in ways you probably didn't predict. With enough tweaking and testing, you'll have yourself the game you want and may very well be a publishable system. But doing it willy-nilly means that you're always working on your first playtest version.</p>

                            My position is (as far as I can tell) completely different from any side:<br>
<br>
A good game design is one that does what the designer wanted, if it is played as closely to as written as possible.<br>
<br>
A great game design is one that does what the designer wanted, even as the play deviates from the text.<br>

There's quite a bit more too it, but that's as simple as I can make it making it technical.<br>

                            Games have systems for a reason.   A system is the common means that the players understand a game is to operate under; and even if systems are re-written, re-vamped, modified or adjusted...it is still a core system.<br>
<br>
Playing without any system invites anyone to do anything they want; and even in this case, they tend to follow a system, it just isn't named or official.  While this might be fun for a few people, it means anyone who doesn't udnerstand how those individuals are playing the game has no real way to play that game themselves.    Playing is style based, so not all styles are going to fit a certain person; just as not all games are going to grab the players attention or keep it.<br>
<br>
Since the entire idea of most stories is to allow people the ability to play them, systems provide a way to turn a story, into more than just a story, but into a playable game with rules and definitions that are easily understood.   If the system makes the game unplayable, it's the wrong system for the game...it doesn't mean it's a bad system entirely.<br>
<br>
For people who like the focus of the story to be on the story and character development, I reccomend systems like Adam Cerling's End and Means.<br>
<br>
I mentioned I am using it in my own game world, but I think the "WHY" is relevent to this thread, and so I'll now get around to the point of saying -Why- I strongly like game systems.<br>
<br>
I actually wrote and started developing Sanctum: The Fallout about twelve years ago.   I stopped because while I had a world, and it would make a great story, and I thought; a spectacular game, I couldn't find a way to make it work.    The gaming systems I found didn't do the game world justice and so I thought perhaps it was just a great idea that just wouldn't work as a game.   I am an idea maker, but making my own system was too daunting...I didn't even consider it!<br>
<br>
Then I played Adam Cerling's System not quite a year ago and as I played, The excitement started to buzz...I started transposing his system over my game and then I realized that it WAS Possible to have a story that flows but be playable as a game that gives it structure without taking away from the story or creativity of where the story could go.   So, I told Adam my idea and asked permission to adapt my game to his system.<br>
<br>
He's approved for the beta testing and so Sanctum was born. (which started out a table-top, and has now been modified into a larp)   And while Sanctum will work with several systems, it already is fitted with the gaming system that works BEST for it.   It's simple, it doesn't limit the world and it doesn't make players act a certain way.   You don't to babysit the players, you don't have to tell them what to do, where to go, or how to think, and for Sanctum: that's what I want from it.<br>
<br>
But some people DO want to be told.   Some players need to be told or they don't enjoy themselves.   Some people need things to be black and white...<br/>
<br/>
And that's the whole point.<br/>
<br/>
So to love the system?  Sure, as long as it's the right system for what you are trying to do, or what the players need in order to play the game and have fun.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

A system does <i>nothing</i> on it's own.  People at the table do things.  They follow procedures and methods, and employ techniques, to do those things.  Those are the system of play - if you did it, in that sense, it's part of the system of play.<br/><br/>I'd argue, passionately, that no game text can ever provide the full range of methods and techniques used to play that game - that none of these games is <i>complete</i> in that sense, and that any pretense that they are is misleading.<br/><br/>I'd also argue, passionately, that a game text whose core body of techniques, when employed, operates <i>as a unified whole</i> and is <i>sufficient to prduce play</i> is flat-out better as an actual guide to play than a game text that does not.  My definition of what makes for a unified whole differs from that of others, certainly, but that comes down to cases and operations, not principles.<br/><br/>And, yes, I believe that there are game texts whose described bodies of technique are self-contradictory, or are not sufficient to produce play without addition or modification by readers.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
Wyrmwood, what you say is exactly what Ron Edwards said and what he has always said.  When he says "system matters" he is not talking just about the game's text as written.  He is talking about the text AND the procedures the players introduce to make the game work for them.  System is what is done around the table.  It is not just the rules written on the page.  It is far, far more inclusive than that. <br/>
<br/>
You can check out what he means by System here: http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html<br/>
<br/>
And you can check my elaboration on that here: http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2006/09/what-is-system.html<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>Good point, Brand. A truly "complete" game would likely be a dead game--no room for the creative input of the players.</blockquote>
I'm not sure what is meant by this statement, but it reads as nonsense to me. I don't recognize player creativity as part of the rules system for RPGs. The mechanisms for enabling creativity, however, are.  <br><br><span style="color: #339966;">And <b>MattJohnston</b>, I believe you fall squarely into the target demographic for Dead of Night. If you buy it and hate it, I'll buy it back from you at your purchase price. (You'll just be out shipping to me.) I have the same userID at RPG.net and Steampower Publishing if you'd like to follow up on this offer. </span><br/><br/>My take on this conversation is pretty simplistic: game rules are a form of communication. <br/>As a designer, you must have a clearly communicated vision of how your game is supposed to work in practice. This is your priority. You're not writing a novel, a short story, or a poem. If you're not writing your game to be played, with the rules exactly as written, you're failing before you've even started. <br/><br/>I can't think of a bigger waste of time than to sit down and read RPG after RPG because they're "cool to read". They're either cool to play, or they're a failure. They may be an entertaining failure, but they're still a failure, <i>as a game</i>.  *<br/><br/>As a designer, I cannot definitively determine what would be fun for any prospective player, nor can I impose "fun" on them. It's completely out of my control. The ONLY thing I can do is provide <em>complete</em> and clear rules for the players to follow. Once they stop following the rules I wrote, they're not playing the game I designed. I hope they have fun with their changes, but any investment I have in what they are doing has gone *poof*. The situation is loosely analogous to trying to get product support after you've somehow voided your service plan. <br/><br/>Use the rules as written, with any official errata/support provided by the designer, if available. Why, then, would you kludge together rules to fix an RPG, or port a setting over to another rules system? If you have fun doing that, great -- don't let anyone stop you. Sometimes I think I do/will, but I'm usually wrong. It's where 99% of my unfinished projects originate. <br/><br/>Play the game with the vision that the designer attempted to communicate. It may not be for you, but you'll know that, unequivocally. You'll know that you tried to play out the designer's vision. You didn't corrupt it, and it failed for you. If the designer communicated effectively, you cannot ascribe your failure to anything more than a difference in taste. And there's nothing wrong with that. <br/><br/>Or, to use a crystal clear analogy: <br/>If you want to eat at the table, taste the food, THEN add salt until it suits you. <br/>And if you find it completely unpalatable to begin with, why bother sitting down to eat? <br/>Regardless, don't bitch about the food if you didn't taste it before you added salt. <br/><br/>*Lest anyone think I don't support my hobby, I own a LOT of RPGs -- a few hundred books, including a box of indie titles. I've probably played less than 10% of them after college, due mostly to time and player interest. However, play avoidance is also due in part to terrible rulesets that I simply can't get through, or even worse, that I can't reasonably and reliably implement correctly in play. There's only a couple rulesets that I use consistently. And still, masochistically, I keep buying. Much, much less since Dead of Night has been published. <br/><br/>For some reason, I interpret all RPGs through a Dead of Night lens right now. It's just so damn comfortable. I'm pretty sure it's not narcissicm, but I worry about that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I don't think you're supposed to like your own cooking that much.                        </br></br></div>

<i>Being Theory-Talk</i><br/><br/>I tend to use the "lumpley" version of system. That is why I didn't use the term in my post. The things I'm trying to relate are "how we play" and the game text. The former is more general than system, and the later is often confounded for system, but is something quite different. <br/><br/>Technically, I call "how we play" play constraints, specifically the emerging regularities in play among the players. System is a part of this, specifically the play constraints that relate to credibility of fictional or imagined content. <br/><br/>In relating "how we play" to the game text, it is essential to recognize that these are entirely different levels. In fact, they aren't even adjacent, the game text isn't read into the constraints, it's read into the content which is constrained by the players. The game text, the history of play, and many other things feed play on one side. On the other, the emergent constraints of play describe what is talked about and what is done. <br/><br/>Game design is the art (and perhaps science) of constructing game texts so that they will cause specific constraints in play. I generally call this process, induction. <br/><br/>Hence, a good game design describes the desired constraints, and if successfully induced through play to that level, will in fact play that way. A great game design takes the induction into account, and induces desired play constraints, even if those constraints are not those in the game text. <br/><br/><i>End Theory-Talk</i><br/><br/>Dropping back out of technical language, a great game design accounts for, or even exploits, the fact that players cannot play a RPG as written, and that "how they play" will naturally diverge from any method in written in the book. <br/><br/>My position is that we should not be caught up in games that play as written, so much as using every tool at our disposal to make games that play well.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>

                            Games and systems don't always come as a package deal; even if they work well together.   Systems can be created without games and Games can be created without systems.  Preference doesn't make right or wrong, in my opinion.<br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rumble</cite> If you're not writing your game to be played, with the rules exactly as written, you're failing before you've even started.</blockquote>
I don't think I agree with this statement.    It may be a failure to the creator if the way they mean the game to be played is played another way, but I'd take it as flattery.   It is only a failure to me, if the game or system in question cannot be played as is at all.   While success can be measured by the preference players give to playing it the way it was originally intended, I don't think that automatically equates into a failure.  But then again, I'm not a system developer, I'm a world designer...<br/><br/>On the same note; I don't think it's fair to assume writers just put out pretty stories.   It IS the writers responcibility to find a system that works for that story if they want anyone to understand how it was meant to be played out in the first place.<br/><br/>It is only a failure, if the story/Game is unplayable.<br/><br/>If it is broken, fix it, and if people prefer playing with a certain system but with modifiers, I dont' think it's a failure, I think it is just expandable from the original idea; which I don't see as such a bad thing.    (of course, I think back to my first few games in which instead of setting stats as per the book, we just rolled them - it's just one way we modified the system to be more towards the way we played the game)<br/><br/>As for player creativity...everyone should know thier audiance and so yes, creativity does matter!   Certain games are going to appeal to certain types of people, and like I said earlier, it's really just preference.   The wrong system can ruin a good game and the wrong game can hold back a great system; when you find the right combination; that's a jackpot.<br/><br/>It's not about the system, or the story.<br/><br/>You need both.<br/><br/>Player creativity can be stiffled, or encouraged by the rules set; but the system already accounts for this by existing in the first place.   I don't see how it vanishes, and at the same time, player creativity isn't going to change the rule system.<br/><br/>Correct me if I'm wrong, I think what rumbling meant with the creativity bit was that The rules don't change mid-game because the system allows for it, they are changed by people who don't like the rules that way in the first place; which defeats the point of having rules in the first place to some degree.<br/><br/>I DO agree with that.<br/><br/>A system is used for a game because it is meant to be the BEST way to play; and that means without modifications.<br/><br/>If you have to mod something, you really should be looking for a different system to be playing with in regards to the game you are playing, especially if by the time you are through with it, it doesn't even resemble the original idea.<br/><br/>On the other side; just because you don't like a system doesn't mean it's a bad system; it just doesn't work with what you are trying to use it for, or in most cases, you are trying to play a game that isn't your style of playing in the first place.<br/><br/>That's no fault of the creator, that's just someone's preferences being different.<br/><br/>I have to give props to rumble for his post; there are many things I couldn't have said better.  (even if one or two things I didn't fully take the same view on!)                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
When I say "System" I mean the Lumpley Principal.  I say that because, as Mendel says, there is no way that players can play a game as written.  As they read the rules, they will make judgements and interpretations.  Their precise methods for implementing play will vary (a little or a lot) from what the designer wrote.  Which is fine!  To me, it makes no sense to talk about system in the absence of player input and procedures.  If we're talking just game text, I use the term "rules".<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            Sara,<br/><br/>My impression of what Merwin was saying is that a designer should be writing a game that works. IOW, with the basic assumption that the end-goal is to produce a ruleset that, as has been said earlier, helps the players to have more fun than they would have had without it. If the designer is going into the writing process with the assumption that the user is going to be ignoring whole swaths of the text (System Doesn't Matter), then he's essentially admitting that they don't need his help in order to get their fun. Naturally, this sort of questions why he's bothering to write his game in the first place.<br/><br/>IMO, this is one of the prime mistakes made by a lot of the "lite" RPGs I've seen, and even a few crunchy ones (if I'm understanding him correctly).                        </div>

                            Ok, I was not aware that Story Games is Forge-Speek territory. I did use the word "system" in the more widely known sense up to now. What I meant is a game's rules and dynamics as written. So in most "classic games", we would be talking about a few procedures and that would be that. However, in many indie games, with these procedures comes "that thing the rules want you to do". That, specifically, is what I'm talking about, and what I'm perceiving as overrated. Again, maybe this is not actually what happens at gaming tables throughout Story Game Land. It's just what it sometimes sounds like in the online discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Mendel, I totally agree with your last statement.<br/>

                            1) I don't follow these indie forums very well for various reasons, including time. <br/>2) I can't follow arguments for a long time, because my thoughts eventually fracture. <br/>My apology is this: Sorry if I start something here that I can't finish.

I don't understand. Could you provide an example of a game without a system? 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite><br/>Dropping back out of technical language, a great game design accounts for, or even exploits, the fact that players cannot play a RPG as written, and that "how they play" will naturally diverge from any method in written in the book.<br/><br/>My position is that we should not be caught up in games that play as written, so much as using every tool at our disposal to make games that play well.<br/><br/>- Mendel S.</blockquote>
It sounds like Mendel said two things (paraphrasing): <br/><br/>1) We should design with the assumption that players cannot or will not follow instructions/rules as written. <br/>To this, I ask, why should I even bother writing instructions/rules? <br/><br/>2) Gah. I can't even figure this one out. I keep thinking of the nursery rhyme...*<br/>I can't tell if Mendel's last statement refers to play or to design. Is it both?  <br/><br/>If it refers to design, I read it as: <br/>"Design while you play, and make sure that when you actually design (outside of play), you do it really well." <br/><br/>If it refers to play, I read it as: <br/>Don't bother with what a game actually asks you to do. Just take it, mix in your own experience, and have a good time. <br/><br/>Both interpretations are unpalatable to me. With the first option, how can I enjoy just playing a game, without the pressure/added work of design? With the second, I don't have to actually design anything. I just have to release an RPG self-help book, and I'm good. <br/><br/>Perhaps there's a clarification that doesn't rely on technical jargon (which I don't follow)? <br/><br/>*The nursery rhyme...<br/>There was a little girl, with a little curl, <br/>Right in the middle of her forehead. <br/>And when she was good, she was very, very good. <br/>And when she was bad, she was horrid. <br/>Not that it necessarily has any direct relevance -- his post just made me think of it.                        </div>

I think this works for game systems too. If you understand what the designer wants to achieve, you are able to tweak the system to your needs. If you don't, then you'll seriously fail, and the tweaked system will become a pile of shit. (Now, I'm not saying you can't love that pile of shit, it's your choice.)<br/>
<br/>
Of course the game can be written in such a way that you can't understand its goals no matter how hard you try. I think that's probably the designers fault. Or you were never meant to understand it, but I figure that's the Twin Peaks way of designing things.                        </div>

                            With the delightful exception of The Lumpley Principal humor, there is something about this thread that smells funny.<br/><br/>Frank, strawman about "Forge-speak" notwithstanding, I think it's pretty well observed that the notion that there is any commonly understood definition of "system" across all of gaming in general is preposterous.<br/><br/>Of late, I've really been feeling as though the god of gaming has descended and is trying to issue the curse of Babel to prevent people from communicating clearly. All I'm seeing here is a whole lot of "This is my personal credo about system," and "No! That's not what I meant!" The former of which is fine, I suppose, as long as we're not under any illusions that it's a dialogue. [Insert knowledgeable-looking reference to Wittgenstein here.]<br/><br/>Short answer to original question: Yes. That's the whole point of game design. I'd continue to use heavily drifted D&amp;D if it weren't. Regarding observed games that failed to be fun for whatever reason, I'm going to speculate that there's more going on social-contract-wise than is fair to blame on "gaming the rules."

                            (Now, I've gotten some flack for using the word system, but by system, I mean the character creation/conflict-resolution system that enables there to be structure and rules for the story to follow...)<br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rumble</cite>1) <br/>I don't understand. Could you provide an example of a game without a system?<br/></blockquote>
Sure, or rather, I'll try to explain what I was saying.    I don't promise that it will come out the way I intend it to be understood <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> I think I found disagreement with the statement I quoted earlier  because I felt that it makes an assumption that each game and the system are being created at the same time and by the same person; or, that it is being written with the system already in mind.  One of the things that I was thrilled about with my own game creation was that I was able to modify it from the intent of a d20 System to Adam Cerling's End and Means.    <br/><br/>So with that statement, is where I'm going to try and illulstrate my point.    Am I nothing more than a pretty literature writer because I don't write the conflict resolution system?  The statement in question implied this, by stating that unless I told people how to play it, the creation was nothing more than pretty words. And this is where I don't agree.    Why is it a failure, if I'm not the one who finds the solution to how to play it?    The only time I feel it is a failure, is if I demand it be played by a system that makes it unplayable!  (in my eyes)   So, it could be said that a world system without a conflict resolution system is a success for as long as someone can play it consistantly; which they could very easily do with a system of thier own choosing.<br/><br/>Not only does my own game fit into this category of 'stand alone', but I'm sure it's not that hard to think about how many games survive modification and come out just fine, if not better in the end.<br/><br/>I agree that without a system, a game is incomplete, but I also feel that some games are designed to work in mulitiple ways, and not always with the same system, so my issue is with saying that to write a world without writing a way to play it one way is a failure.  I don't think that a world without a system is just a pretty piece of literature; just an incomplete 'world system' that hasn't found the right engine yet. <br/><br/>Some people would argue that a game world without a system is merely a setting; but this isn't always the case.   If anything other than a game world, it would be a world creation system, which is alot different than 'just a setting'.    I feel settings are set by the GM and Players; the world may be a 'rule' of the setting, but it's not really the setting; it's just a guideline that is meant to be followed.<br/><br/>With just about everything else stated in Rumble's post, I agree with; but I just can't find myself agreeing with what I felt was a blanket statement.<br/><br/>While I understand that the statement was meant initially to be applied to designers it got branched out to other types of designers with the comment of pretty liturature that was just nothing more than meaningless worlds without a way to play it.<br/><br/>I don't classify the same things as a failure,so that's where I vocalized where I feel there's a line of seperation.    There are different types of designers, and not all of us have the same requirements.    So, perhaps not a failure as much as 'work in progress'<br/><br/>Does that make sense, or am I just rambling now? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<i>Technical Section Begins</i><br/><br/>I see two distinct hypotheses running around, I will semi-arbitrarilly name them:<br/><br/>Strong Interpretability - The game text can be understood and played arbitrarilly accurately. The only deviations occur from conscious decisions, including the decision to stop at some point in interpreting and move on to playing.<br/><br/>Weak Interpretability - The game text does not impart an arbitrary understanding. After some point interpretation is more contigent on the reader than the text. In this case, the text is a participant, not an authority.<br/><br/>With Strong Interpretability, the two answers to the question are consciously play the game correctly and consciously deviate from the text. <br/><br/>With Weak Interpretability, the two answers to the question are unconsciously deviate from the text and consciously deviate from the text. <br/><br/><i>Technical Section Ends</i><br/><br/>Now, I'm on both sides of this wall. On one hand, I generally hold that you cannot play a specific text as accurately as you wish. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I work with formal semantics, so I can see situations where a text can written so that it actually can be played as written. But I've never seen a game written that way, and frankly I doubt it would sell. <br/><br/>So for practical purposes, I assume that no one (even the designer) can play a game text with arbitrary correctness. <br/><br/>If you want some specific reasons why play differs, I direct you to an article I wrote a while ago: <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/physics20may04.html" rel="nofollow">Planning for Failure</a>. Pay special attention to the two ways of dealing with failure: Fixing it or Counting on it. <br/><br/>As I've suggested above, part of designing RPGs is to accept that deviation will happen. And the challenge is to see them not as a burden, but as an opportunity. <br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                        </div>

                            Sara,<br/><br/>I'm still a little confused about your point.  Let me ask some questions.  Are you saying that a game setting can be a game even if it doesn't have a system attached to it?  Now let me define my terms a bit so that you know exactly what I'm asking.<br/><br/><b>Game Setting:</b> Details about the fiction established before play actually begins.  These details can and will be altered during actual play.  Settings can include geography, political institutions, local NPCs, etc. etc.<br/><br/><b>System:</b> Whatever procedures are used to add things to the fiction during play.<br/><br/>My other question is how do you play if there are no procedures for adding things to the fiction?  How is it a game at that point?  If all you have is a setting and no procedures for adding or changing the setting/fiction then you are essentially static, just as if you were reading a book.                        </div>

                            Gaerik,<br/><br/>The confusion about my point may come in by the fact that I am not referring to just the setting at all.   (at least not with your definition of it)<br/><br/>by your definition, My 'world' is a system.  So, to elaborate, now the 'game' has become two systems that work to play the game a particular way.   It's the same thing but with different terms.    I like keeping things simple, so I try and seperate the two.  (and to be further clear, the world does not have politcal institutions, local NPC's, or set geography, simply a system for how they are created)    -note again, I use system literally...as in how the dictionary defines it, and I use it because I wouldn't know what else to call it-<br/><br/><br/>Let me clarify using my own game.<br/><br/>With Sanctum; There are elements that exist, and rules that give structure to those elements, and using this, you could in theory attatch nearly any system to the game and it would still operate without defying or breaking the story, intent, or world.   As long as the core is followed, Sanctum is being played exactly the way it is meant to be played, because it remains true to the game's motive.      Yet, there is no conflict resolution system within the game at this point.<br/><br/>So, is it complete, or is it a failure?     It is playable,  but it not corrupted by adding a conflict resolution system; so it is both incomplete and yet not a failure.  (From table-top, to larp, to free-styled storytelling with player interaction...it all depends on what sort of conflict resolution system is adapted)<br/><br/>However, when I add a conflict resolution system to it; in my case, I've added Ends and Means; I'm modifying the game of Sanctum, but I am STILL not altering the core system/game/world, or whatever you want to call it.   I AM, however, suggesting that it is the best use of a conflict resolution system to get the most of this particular game when I add that conflict resolution system.  (but only for a certain playstyle...which means that each time I add a system, I'm by some people's definition writing an entirely new game.   But is it really a different game if it's the same game with different conflict resolution systems?)  <br/><br/>Is this a better explanation?<br/><br/>When I write my 'game' Sanctum; there will be a game book, which has nothing to do with conflict resolution systems, and simply tells you how to play, but then there will be instructions on how to adapt the game to different conflict resolution systems.  So where would this be categorized?   I have a hard time believing it is considered static fiction, as I'm not writing a story, I'm simply giving the framework that DEMANDS the story, world and the things within it be written by the GM and players, but giving the tools to do it with.  (and yes, for those who prefer everything pre-set, I will be offering a variety of pre-set worlds with basic backgrounds)<br/><br/>Again, I just want to clarify my main point with my quote and that post is not feeling something is a failure for not being as complete as it could be by itself.<br/><br/>--------------If there's more questions, lets move this to a different place, because the new posts aren't really addressing the initial post anymore!-------------                        </div>

                            Larry, this whole talk about "the designer knows what he's doing, but do you?" is part of the reason of the phenomenon I talk about, because it already expresses a strong belief in the game's mechanics' ability to produce great play. Hey, that's a common phrase, isn't it? "Mechanics <i>produce</i> play." But when you think about it, play produced by mechanics actually doesn't sound worthwhile to me. Yes, I <i>am</i> talking about the Fruitful Void.<br/>
<br/>
But what I am really talking about is one step further. I am talking about the phenomenon of carrying this belief in the designer and the mechanics to excess. I am talking about not stepping into the Fruitful Void even if it's actually there, because you are too busy guessing what the clever designer wanted to make you do. Pushing hard in a Dogs conflict instead of stepping back and saying, "Hey, that character would not continue the argument at this point." Going for Sincerity in MLwM no matter what, instead ot stepping back and saying, "Hey, that character would rather die than open his heart in this situation."<br/>
<br/>
So, well, I think I am at this point only repeating myself. I'll leave it to everybody's own judgement whether this phenomenon really exists, or whether it's just an impression you might wrongly gain in internet discussions. Thanks everybody for the discussion, it was very insightful.                        </div>

                            Frank,<br>
<br>
I think you're talking here about "playing the game" vs. "playing the character". Playing the game should be written in the game text while playing the character isn't necessary a thing for a designer to make rules for. These two types of playing are sometimes contradictory, and the player should decide between them.<br>
<br>
If she chooses to play the game (getting or spending resources, going for conflict etc.) then he's more interested in the game aspect than the character aspect. This doesn't mean she's too afraid to change the system, nor that the system is bad, it's a choice. (I, for example, am much more interested in playing a game than playing a character. Not sure all roleplayers like me now. :P)<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you're pointing out that sometimes it's not a choice because the player isn't aware of the "playing the game" vs "playing the character" issue, I'm totally with you.<br/>
<br/>
As a side point I don't think that a system where playing the game is always equal to playing the character is impossible, I'm just not sure it would be fun enough.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

From my perspective, you've described a gaming resource. Kinda like The Primal Order, if I was forced to point at something similar. <br/><br/>If someone who never roleplayed before picks it up, can they play it with everything you've provided? It doesn't sound like pure setting. It's setting plus guidelines, but as you've described it, it's not standalone. I wouldn't call it a game, myself. <br/><br/>W/r/t different game with different systems, I'd say yes and no. In the squicky swamp of RPG publication, almost anything goes. <br/><br/>Is Omlevex a game? Definitely not, but it provides guidelines for play, and stat blocks for a number of systems. Pick your poison and play. <br/><br/>Is Feng Shui the same as Feng Shui d20 through Burning Shaolin? Is Dying Earth RPG the same as Dying Earth d20? Did Godsend Agenda become a different game when they moved from their proprietary system to WEG d6? I say the feel of those games distinctly changed when they changed systems. The game "concept" was the same, but execution, and therefore feel, were definitely different.                        </div>

But also, Vincent has repeatedly stated that character integrity is as vital for thematic play as it is for immersive or other styles of play.  Your examples show someone who potentially violates character integrity, though judging that from the outside is going to be difficult.  But notice how that's a choice!  In both cases, the players are not breaking nor bending the rules, nor are they constrained by them.  They give or don't, go for sincerity die or don't.  That's a matter of their play style.<br/><br/>It seems to me what you're critiquing here is the claim that one can play with a win-maximizing strategy and still get the most thematic play out of the game.  But that's a whole different issue.<br/><br/>Because the text of Dogs definitely tells you to give if it makes sense.  And the text is part of the rules as well.  If you never give, even when it makes sense, you're not playing as written.                        </div>

I keep coming back to this discussion, and really just … not liking it.  And the crux of it, I think is right in these two posts.  System is one of the bits of Forge jargon that I unabashedly adopt because until you equate system with rules-text, you come up against exactly these questions, and everyone fights about "Rule Zero" malarky.  (And it does seem like we're a breath away from "kool-aid" comments.)  If you take the Lumpley Principle on, and system is <em>what you do at the table,</em> you can go on to ask how much the rules-text influences that, and whether it's pulling it's weight or not, <i>ad nauseum.</i> <br/><br/>That, and I feel like there's been a lot of venom in this discussion.  Venom seems out of place here, and it makes me with that the old "filter this discussion" buttons did what I thought they would do…                        </div>

Yes! Even more so, the claim that a game could be designed in a way that win-maximizing strategy is the <i>best </i>way to get thematic play and generally rockin' content out of it. That's it. Thanks for helping me to put it in words!<br/>

Every example of actual play I can think of involving Capes, TSoY or Dogs in the Vineyard seems to support the theory that you can design a game that does this.  In fact, I can't think of a single Dogs game in which the complete desire to game the system didn't result in good play.                        </div>

                            Actually, I think Frank has a point in this regard.  I think the burden of proof here will be on the games to show that they can deliver this kind of dynamic.  Capes might be able to do it--I don't own it, but it sounds like the most likely candidate.  But for me personally, just being in the mind set of winning distances me from the characters involved and therefore from the thematic value of the game, and it limits the amount of choices (like giving in Dogs) available to make thematic statements.<br/><br/>Now, we have games that are <i>very good </i>at this, meaning that pushing hard to succeed often furthers the intensity and can lead to more thematic charge.  But I'm not really sure we have ones that always deliver in this regard, nor that such a perfect fusion is possible.<br/><br/>And again: for me, it also matters <i>why </i>I make an in-game decision.  Making it to win means that I aim for a certain reward, and it's a different one than the one I aim for when I consciously make a thematic decision.                        </div>

                            My experience with Capes (and YMMV, of course) is that playing hard to win does not, just by itself, result in strong thematic play.  If the group wants strong thematic play and aims their efforts towards it, then playing hard can support those efforts.  But just playing hard - just trying to win without any thought about aesthetic and thematic issues - has not resulted in satisfying thematic play.<br/><br/>So, my take on this kind of game lines up with what Frank is saying here...                        </div>

                            Okay.  Just to point out something about Dogs.  Gaming the system in Dogs isn't done by winning all your Conflicts.  In fact, winning all your Conflicts will get you dead, dead, dead.... due to taking too much d10 Fallout.  Gaming the system in Dogs is done by collecting d4 and d6 Fallout.  Fallout at that level makes you more effective by giving you more dice.  Giving during some conflicts is almost required to do this.  When and where you give creates thematic content.  So does when and where you don't and risk the d10 Fallout to actually win the conflict at hand.  I have yet to play in a Dogs game where this isn't the case.  I'd love to read an Actual Play report where this wasn't the case.                        </div>

<i>When and where you give creates thematic content. </i><br/><br/>If I make the decision to end a conflict not because I think it makes a thematic statement not to escalate, but because I want to reap the fallout, I don't see a thematic value in that.  Sure, in the fiction, the Dog lost a conflict and that will have consequences.

Now that is an interesting point given some of the discussions going around about what it is you're really supposed to do as a GM, since it is often different from the players.<br/><br/>I've got more to say but I've got to drive home at the moment.  I'll try to get back to this later.                        </div>

I think it's saying "Some Systems Don't Matter Because Their Win Conditions Aren't Mine" which is like saying there's no democracy in the UK because they have a Queen.<br/><br/>Gaming a system to "win" and that yielding valuable thematic play only works when the game system is geared to provide the valuable thematic play that you want.  If you get into a <em>Dogs</em> game but don't care about making moral judgements, play <em>Dust Devils</em> but don't care about when to put down the gun, or play <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> and don't care about who your character is, then no, gaming those systems to win will not yield you thematic play you're interested in.  It's like the one time I played <em>PTA</em> with a guy who rarely watches television: it really and profoundly didn't work.<br/><br/>What a lot of these specifically-geared indie games do is privilege one type of thematic play over all others, and do so by installing that into the reward system.  <em>Capes</em> is a testosterone-fueled one-ups-manship of challenging and defending identity.  Playing that game hard will not ever produce the <em>Joy Luck Club</em> (where characters discover and come to celebrate their identity), nor will it produce <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> (where characters are trapped by their identity).<br/><br/>If you are looking for something relatively specific when you say "thematic play" then you also need to play a relatively specific game (or design one to fit).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank T</cite><br/>Yes! Even more so, the claim that a game could be designed in a way that win-maximizing strategy is the<em>best</em>way to get thematic play and generally rockin' content out of it. That's it. </blockquote>
I would agree with you if win-maximizing strategy would require a complete disregard of thematic coherency, that is to say if in order to "play to win" you have to completely ignore whether your contribution to the in-game fiction actually fits or makes sense. But that is not the case. <br/><br/>You can play to win, while still keeping the in-game fiction rocking. Because it's your (as in the player's) responsibility to do things that are cool and interesting. It's not the rules' job to filter out the crappy contributions from the good ones. It's not the GM's job to shoot down whatever contribution he considers bad for the game. It's yours. Both you as a player and you as a group. That thing about positive feedback from the other people at the table, whenever you did something awesome? It works the other way around, too. If somebody wants to do something that wrecks your appreciation for the game, don't look for the rules to stop him. Don't wait for the GM to step in. Think Nancy Reagan.. and just say No. <br/><br/>If you don't take this attitude as a given, as a requirement for good gaming... then yes, simply following the rules, and playing them to the limit is not going to necessarily produce good gaming. Chances are it'll produce some kind of wild gonzo style game. (And probably not in a good way.)<br/><br/>But playing the rules to the limit has nothing to do with disregarding the narrative your game produces. You seem to oppose ignoring the in-game fiction in favour of the rules. Fair enough. Although I don't think many people do this. I certainly don't, even if you seem to have gotten this impression. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I oppose putting the in-game fiction above the rules (aka "story Ã¼ber alles"), because that in my eyes makes the rules obsolete. Using all the rules and creating rocking in-game fiction isn't mutually exclusive, even if there are games that beat this belief into people's heads (e.g. The Dark Eye).                        </div>

I think there's an issue here in the discussion--Min-maxing and "playing to win", as I understand them, are NOT the same thing. Min-maxing is just about optimizing your character for a particular situation. Playing to win is, well, playing with the mindset of always winning.<br/><br/>Min-maxing is an extremely common technique for thematic play. Gawd, so many of the current cop of thematic games all but <i>require</i> min-maxing mechanically. (Like PTA, your Issue basically pushes a single general conflict on the PC.) Playing to win, however... Playing to win does not neccessarily mesh with thematic play. In certain situations thematic play may be about winning, but not always.                        </div>

Playing for <em>character</em> win may not mesh with thematic play, sure.  But I think if you reconfigure it to <em>player</em> win, and allow a 'win' to be defined as "see my character utterly destroyed, sobbing on the ground" as well as "my character becomes Good King of Summerlund," I don't see much of a conflict.                        </div>

And if we redefine "skin cells" as "US currency," I won't have much of a problem paying my rent! (Sorry, but after that whole Queen/UK glibness I cannot resist.)<br/><br/>I don't think it's that hard to understand that people are not talking about "winning" in terms of "whatever I happen to want to achieve as a player," but in terms of mechanical goals. Winning conflicts in Dogs is a mechanical goal that, as has been pointed out, can be pursued without particular attention to the themes of the game. The mechanical effects of giving and the thematic effects of giving are different.                        </div>

Why would you play a game that did something that you didn't want to acheive?  Discarding your own interests in favor of "winning" some piece of an abstract game that you have no actual, personal interest in seems to kind of totally miss the point.  Especially if you consider that the very act of adopting that as a win condition is turning it from an inert part of a game design and into a goal.  Sure, you "win" conflicts in <em>Dogs,</em> but nowhere in the game does it say that that's the point of playing the game.  That's like playing golf and gloating that you got the highest score.  Sure, you can do it, but you're not really playing golf at that point, are you?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Playing for <em>character</em> win may not mesh with thematic play, sure.  But I think if you reconfigure it to <em>player</em> win, and allow a 'win' to be defined as "see my character utterly destroyed, sobbing on the ground" as well as "my character becomes Good King of Summerlund," I don't see much of a conflict.</blockquote>
Well... yeah. But we have to be careful how we define terms. I was using the assumption that "win" meant mechanical success, as that was my understanding of "play to win". If we define "win" to simply mean we express our desired thematic statement, then yes, all thematic play is about "winning". But I think such a definition is going to cause alot of confusion, and probably doesn't <i>really</i> express the idea we're trying to get at.<br/><br/>Which, btw, I believe I understand what you're getting at. Thematic play runs along a thematic axis, and choices and evaluations about play should also run along that axis. I would totally agree with that. The issue is that right now we're using language that suggests tactics, not theme.<br/><br/>This gets at why min-maxing is so common in thematic play. More precisely, I believe min-maixing in thematic play is still about optimization, but what we're optimizing the character <i>for</i> is different in thematic play than in tactical play. In tactical play, as I said, min-maxing is usually done to optimize the PC for mechanical success. But there are a number of reason for this in thematic play, one of which is to maximize PC <i>adversity</i>.<br/><br/>Like, I had this <i>Lacuna</i> character who by chance ended up being tricked out for fighting. He was all brutality and no communication.  He cold literally wipe the floor in any fight. But then... he fell in love, and he had no ability to deal with that. And in fact, the skills he did have---brutality &amp; violence---worked counter to his desired goal---that being a loving and peaceful life. The min-maxing in this case made the conflict all the more heartbreaking, difficult, and tragic.                        </div>

                            I think there's a hang up here on what winning really is about.  I didn't even think about winning to be associated with strict mechanical success because that just seemed silly.  I've never witnessed winning (in an RPG) to be anything other than about social reinforcement.  Now, if mechanical success and social reinforcement happen to align then they might get smooshed together but that isn't always the case in RPGs.  For example...<br/><br/>My Wizard in a bog standard D&amp;D game gets swallowed whole by a purple worm.  While in the stomach I have him break his Staff of Power for a retributive strike and destroy the purple worm while killing my Wizard.<br/><br/>In this case my character is dead which is most definitely a mechanical lose condition.  However, every one of my buddies at the table are going, "Man... that was the coolest thing EVAR!"  And they will geek out about that moment for the next 20 years when we talk about that game.  It doesn't matter that mechanically I lost... or at the most got a draw condition.  I won.  Pure and simple.<br/><br/>Back to Dogs...  The mechanics in Dogs make it trivially easy for the Dogs to win conflicts (unless they are divided among themselves).  You're rarely going get any sort of social reinforcement for winning in the mechanical sense because it just isn't that hard to do.  What ends up being socially rewarded and "winning" is the points and which you are willing to take that ton of Fallout when it is a close call at winning the conflict or the times you give when you could very easily roll over the opposition.  Both those situations elicit reactions like... "Wow.  That was cool." and that is what constitutes winning.  I'd argue that is what actually constitutes winning in every RPG including ones that are heavily competitive.<br/><br/>Now, someone brought up that striving to win will rob the actions of meaning because the meaning was all tactical.  I think this is a red herring.  Meaning is assigned to actions after the fact on reflection not based on whatever reasoning was going on in the player's head when the actions were actually taken.  In fact, it isn't hard to see two different players coming up with two different meanings for the same actions.  Who cares what the player was thinking internally when the action happened.  What's assigned meaning is what actually happens in the fiction.<br/><br/>So, if rulesets create mechanics that are tied to the thematic premise of the game (ie Dogs and Moral Judgements), then gaming the system hard is going to produce thematic and meaningful play more reliably and easily than trying to do the same thing with a system that doesn't connect the mechanics to thematic issues.<br/><br/>I'm rambling again.  I need to organize my thoughts some more but I'll leave this out there anyway.                        </div>

<i>Meaning is assigned to actions after the fact on reflection not based on whatever reasoning was going on in the player's head when the actions were actually taken.</i><br/><br/>We're bumping up against the classic intentionalist/consequentialist divide here.  Is an action's moral value measured by the results or by the intention of the actor?  For me, that translates to game-relevance as well.  I always, always have to take into account what the reasoning was for taking an action, both the player's reasoning and the character's reasoning.<br/><br/>See, I think saying that we can play for the win and at the same time create as much or more thematic content than we do when we specifically play thematically is kind of a wish for a sorcerer's stone that combines Gamist and Narrativist play.  But the two are just so different from the very moment I sit down at the table that I don't see that working.  Have you ever played in hardcore Gamist groups?  I know that if I played Dogs with my hardcore Gamist group, even if we played the mechanics hard (and we would), the feel and the outcome of the game would be very different, and while the characters would be involved in thematic judgments, we as players wouldn't pay much attention to that, and the outcome in that regard would be diffuse and coincidental.<br/><br/><i>So, if rulesets create mechanics that are tied to the thematic premise of the game (ie Dogs and Moral Judgements), then gaming the system hard is going to produce thematic and meaningful play more reliably and easily than trying to do the same thing with a system that doesn't connect the mechanics to thematic issues.</i><br/><br/>I think you will find that this is a point on which we all agree.  (Though most of the thematic value of Dogs lies not in the conflicts, but in the Dogs' decisions once they've won: how do they judge and how do they solve the issue?)  Where I disagree, though, is that your purpose of using the mechanics still matters; i.e., the Creative Agenda you're aiming for when you're gaming the system hard has a serious impact on how the game goes.  If the game's designed right, and taking Josh's point about different themes into account, you might not see much of a difference from the outside for large parts of the game.  But it does not always line up, nor is the difference in the purpose of play trivial.                        </div>

                            This is also a stance issue, I'm thinking.  Does significant thematic play go like this:<br/><br/>Player Decision (Tactical or Thematic) --&gt; Character Decision in Fiction --&gt; Character Action --&gt; Signficance of Action/Decision (Author or Director Stance)<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>Significance of Decision --&gt; Player Decision (Thematic) --&gt; Character Decision in Fiction --&gt; Character Action (Actor Stance)<br/><br/>Cause if it's the second version for you, then yes, playing to win through tactical mastery of the mechanics is going to kill your thematic play.  Is this what you meant, Eliott?<br/><br/>Tim, Andrew, it sounds to me that you're identifying certain parts of the game system, along with certain circumstances, as "wins" and assuming that the definitions are universal.  The self-sacrifice to blow up the worm is only a loss if character death is an absolute loss.  I see that situation as a very cool pyrrhic victory.  Sure, you lost your character, but you succeeded in your objective.  Is a victory over a big boss character lose its victory status if, in the course of the fight, you use up the last charge on the Flame Wand of Burninating?  Wands are expendible, certainly; player characters can be, too, depending on your priorities.  When you define character loss as an absolute loss, you need to be aware that <em>you are defining</em> that loss condition.  Which is why I see no conflict between "tactical" and "thematic" decisions, because the first step of any tactical situation is defining what counts as a win and what counts as a loss.  If Being a Good Dad is a win condition, then I may stay behind on the asteroid to detonate the nuke and save my daughter, and that's a 'win'.                        </div>

<br/>
The "winning" discussion is a red herring. I am talking about rules-strategizing, how about that for a term?<br/>
<br/>
So, to stick with Dogs as an example. I have played Dogs several times with different people, and I do find the conflict resolution fun, but I don't see how it should produce thematic content just because you strategize for effectiveness. If thematic content enters into the conflict, it enters because the players put it in on a Raise or Ree. That's totally in addition to rules-strategizing.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, "if I take the blow now, I can keep my 10 and reverse his next blow, but that'll be 3d8 fallout" is fun, but it's not thematic unless you make it so. A Dogs conflict is a great playground to stretch your Narrativist muscle, and you'll find nice opportunities all around if you care to look. But it's not like you just can't help producing thematic content in a Dogs conflict if you just game the system hard enough.<br/>

                            I think you're overlooking the "That's Lame" rule -- or whatever it is, I can't remember the exact phrasing -- that states that what counts as a raise or see is dependent on the most demanding player.  Sure, you can just throw out raises and sees that mean nothing, but as long as you're playing with at least one player who gives a shit, your raises and sees must include thematic content or else you are breaking rules.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>Can you give examples of thematic content and non-thematic content in specific actions?</blockquote>
My holier-than-thou Paladin is in a shouting match with a young boy who's seen things he'd prefer not to have seen, and doesn't want to talk about them.  He's cowering; I'm shouting.  I'm almost out of dice, and I've tapped a lot of my traits.  All I've got left is stuff that's not entirely appropriate, like "Lived with the Mountain People 3d8."  If I want to get those dice on the table, I incorporate them into a Raise or See.  The specific narration is up to me, but the raise or see only counts if it's ratified by the rest of the table (ie the most demanding player).  So I could do it a couple ways:<br><br>a) a lame way: "I'm getting all agitated like the Mountain People I lived with."  *roll dice*  Laaaaame.<br>b) tangential: "I tell him that the Mountain People don't have a word for falsehood."  *roll dice*  Could be interesting, but it's out of context.<br>c) pertinent to character: "He's reminding me of the godforsaken Mountain People, who never listened to me while I lived with them, and it's making me apoplectic with rage."  *roll dice*  Interesting -- and depending on roleplay thus far, perhaps very interesting and telling.<br/>d) pertinent to the situation: "I tell him about my years with the Mountain People, and all the horrific blood rites that I witnessed, and tell him that he can let the King take the horrors of what he's seen away."  *roll dice*  It's drawing a correlation and contextualizes the conflict.<br/>e) pertinent to moral judgement: "I tell him that if he doesn't tell me, he'll be exiled to go live with the Mountain People."  *roll dice*  Here it's getting to the core of the game.<br/><br/>Now, depending on your table and what they're interested in seeing, some of these are more likely to be accepted than others.  I wouldn't ever accept (a), and I'd prod a player who was trying (b) to develop it further with a little more narration.  (c) (d) and (e) are increasingly interesting for me.  Additionally, all of these become more interesting and more likely to be ratified if they reincorporate material from earlier in the game, which builds up thematic content (assuming the reincorporated material was also subject to the most demanding player).                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Thanks, I get it now.  And I can see how this could lead to "breaking the rules," insofar as the group enforces that all raises and sees must be pertinent to moral judgment.  That might be a tough standard, though.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>This is also a stance issue, I'm thinking.  Does significant thematic play go like this:<br/><br/>Player Decision (Tactical or Thematic) --&gt; Character Decision in Fiction --&gt; Character Action --&gt; Signficance of Action/Decision (Author or Director Stance)<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>Significance of Decision --&gt; Player Decision (Thematic) --&gt; Character Decision in Fiction --&gt; Character Action (Actor Stance)<br/><br/>Cause if it's the second version for you, then yes, playing to win through tactical mastery of the mechanics is going to kill your thematic play.  Is this what you meant, Elliot?</blockquote>
Um, probably? Your diagram is too dense for me to understand just what you mean.<br/><br/>What <i>I'm</i> saying is that if I'm thinking in terms of "I want what my character wants", and "My character has access to the same resources I do, in terms of affecting what happens in the game", then I'm going to try to win my conflicts, and my desire to win my conflicts is going to interfere with my responsibility to make my raises interesting and relevant, or any desire to produce thematic play. My character has no responsibility to the audience.                        </div>

                            I dig it, Eliott.  This is where you get the characters who do things that aren't terribly exciting, because "it's what the character would do."  Hm.  Must cogitate.<br/><br/>And yes, Christian, it can be a pretty high standard, although it doesn't have to be <em>that</em> high.  Accepting (c)-(e) reliably produces thematic play for me, and it's not too onerous.                        </div>
