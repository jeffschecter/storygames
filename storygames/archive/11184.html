Certainly the prime example of this is <i>D&amp;D</i> which always a selection available, but everything from <i>Burning Wheel</i> to <i>World of Warcraft</i> does the same thing to some degree.<br/><br/>Let me be clear: I'm not saying this kind of choice is a bad thing.  I am asking what's wrong with keeping the racial choices to a minimum, or eliminating choice altogether?  Also, is there any benefit to a single-race play environment?<br/><br/>I can think of two different (admittedly embryonic) fantasy campaigns I've planned that restrict players to a single race.  One involved telling the story of three dwarf kingdoms, with all the PCs naturally being dwarves.  I wanted to explore the culture and motivations of dwarves minus the Tolkienesque bickering between elves and dwarves and the dwarf's usual role as jokester in a mixed-race party.  The second idea involved a kingdom of merfolk, a choice that obviously cuts air-breathers out of the equation and opens up a whole host of questions about life beneath the waves.<br/><br/>Both of these ideas were driven by culture issues, but could accommodate what we might consider more or less standard fantasy gaming, with adventurers and such.  With at least these two examples I don't see any down side to the restriction, while at the same time  play is opened up to some new ideas.  Feel free to chime in with your own ideas about what does and does not work in relation to fantasy races and their availability/scarcity.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248612/#Comment_248612" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T13:42:14+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  1:42PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2009 1:42PM by vulpinoid.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've toyed with a couple of single race fantasy settings over the years.<br/><br/>I like the idea of them because it allows a group to really plunge into the difference within a race rather just simply relegating the different races to their stereotypes (or choosing to play "AGAINST type").<br/><br/>But I find players latch onto archetypes, and if you don't have different races in your game then it makes sense to have your single race expand into a variety of factions that fill the various race niches.<br/><br/>Consider an all dwarf game versus a mixed race game.<br/><br/>The mixed race game might have bow shooting elves, while the dwarf game might have a steampunky rifle shooting group.<br/>The mixed race game might have a race of crafty goblin tinkers or gnomish alchemists, the dwarf game could easily fill these niches.<br/>The mixed race game might have standard humans who embody "normality" for the setting, these would just be replaced by the regular folk of the dwarven people. <br/>In fact the role of the dwarves in a mixed race game might be replaced by a faction of miners who embody the "dwarf's dwarf". <br/><br/>You could spread the idea across all the races commonly found in a setting, but just turn them into factions of your single race. Consider the Spycraft version of d20 (of which I'm really only familiar with the Stargate RPG), instead of races it give you factional backgrounds...different types of military groups and cultural origins. You get your bonuses from these. <br/><br/>Another huge advantage to a single race game is the fact that players can't say "I want to play a half X-half Y", since everyone's the same race the issues of incompatible biology never arise and you can get on with the actual depth of a character's personality rather than the quirkiness of their heritage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248615/#Comment_248615" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T14:05:14+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  2:05PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I HATE the standardization of fantasy in any way whatsoever.

So your very comment is self-contradictory. <br/><br/>I'd always considered the core of the fantasy genre to be a contrast between two standards...in many folk tales it's the conflict between humans and the otherkind (call them fey, spirits, ghost, whatever). Some kind of morality lesson is then gained from comparing the perspectives. Thus when I run a single race game, I try to play up the contrasts of a setting that isn't our own, and then try to get a players perspective on how those contrasts apply to their character (and through the character, the player).<br/><br/>Not that every fantasy game turns into a morality tale, there's always a lot more action and adventure than moralizing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248624/#Comment_248624" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T15:14:35+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  3:14PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantasy to me, as a genre, is the rejection of science and modern civilization as a world view; the re-envisioning of myth, folk-tale and legend.

That requires that we ignore such fantasy stories and games as <i>King Arthur/Pendragon, Stormbringer, Conan</i>, and more. Let's assume, for a moment, that we want to explore a high fantasy setting, while removing or severely restricting the choice of character race/culture. That could produce a few types of story:<br/><br/>1. Explore the one race/culture in greater depth<br/>The problem with this is that most races in high fantasy aren't given the right sort of detail to create adventure within the culture. You might have an extra sourcebook that helps a bit, but likely you'll have to make up a lot of stuff. The question arises, if you have to make up a lot, could you have done it easier with a better game? I'd suggest looking to <i>Earthdawn</i>, specifically the <i>Denizens of Earthdawn</i> books, for decent examples.<br/><br/>2. Play the characters' race/culture off NPC races/cultures<br/>I've done the second type of story, not in <i>D&amp;D</i>, but in <i>Legend of the Five Rings</i>, by restricting race and clan (clans in L5R serve a similar function to races in D&amp;D). It worked remarkably well, but I was up front as to why I was doing it, and also had players new to the game, who didn't have a lot of expectations as to the choices available. An advantage of this is that it promotes teamwork, since there's one less thing to come between the characters.<br/><br/>3. A game where racial/cultural differences are irrelevant<br/>I'd suggest avoiding this option unless you know your group. Taking away choice without letting players know there's a good reason tends to make them feel oppressed. If, however, you sit them down with a swords &amp; sorcery game, such as Pendragon, that expectation won't be there, and there won't be a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248663/#Comment_248663" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T21:02:03+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  9:02PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Usually when I play a fantasy game, we stick to one race, 'cause we usually play all-human games. We tend to joke and say non-human races are "gay."<br/><br/>Probably because when I think of good stuff to put into a fantasy game, I think of stuff from history first, and I tend to game with people like that.<br/><br/>Race in DnD kind of feels like a way for players to make their characters more "special" without having to resort to characterization or in-game behaviour. Like when a group of players all try to make "the one guy in the party who is different" and you end up with every character a totally different race, non of them human, and no reason for them to stick together like Tolkien came up with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248667/#Comment_248667" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T21:08:55+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  9:08PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Certainly, having all PCs share a culture/race/species makes it much more meaningful - sometimes it feels a bit like elves and dwarves have about as much meaningful difference from each other in super-derived-fantasy as, say, tall blonde guys vs. short brunettes.

This certainly makes other races "other" but not more alien than many humans which I guess is the aim in many settings. If I GM in home made fantasy settings all the PCs are humans just so I can make other races as weird as I want without having to fill the player of creature X in on the details as I make them up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248810/#Comment_248810" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T06:49:02+00:00" title="December 28, 2009  6:49AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always wanted to make a human-only game, and convert all the classic D&amp;D racies into different civilizations of humans and see how it affects play.
