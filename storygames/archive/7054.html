Drink water. Start first thing in the morning, taking small sips.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour voice lubricates slowly: ideally, you'd want to start drinking water a few hours before you start speaking. This is difficult if you're starting early in the morning, but start drinking water as early as you can.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Nothing else but water counts. Coffee definitely does not count.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. For half an hour before the stall opens, hum to yourself. Humming is great. It warms up your voice. You really, really need to warm up your voice if you're going to spend the day talking. Hum.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I've heard that the Forge booth does a warm-up to start the morning. I'd really suggest doing <i>both</i> the humming <i>and</i> the formal warm-up.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. During that half hour, practice using your voice in the space you'll use it in. If you'll need to call across the booth, try doing it now. Start gently, but get used to using your voice as you'll use it during the convention.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Throughout the convention, avoid making any harsh, constrained vocal sounds. The two big examples are: shouting and going "Aaargh".<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is unintuitive but important: one uncontrolled shout could really damage your voice.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Learn to speak loudly without shouting. It's possibly and really helps. Practice making clear sounds (as if singing like an opera singer) as you talk loudly. Practice using the tone in your voice (making you sound like a foghorn) to make you easier to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Caffeine and alcohol screw up your voice. It's unrealistic to avoid them completely, but be aware.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Smoking, or being in a smoky atmosphere, <i>really</i> screws up your voice.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Coughing really screws up your voice. Worse still, when your voice starts getting croaky, the instinct is to cough, which makes it worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're talking all day, do your very best not to cough, at all. Really. Take small sips of water instead of coughing: it stops you needing to cough.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. The first sign that you're damaging your voice is a tickle at the back of the throat. (If you get a tickle in the back of the throat, <i>do not cough to get rid of it</i>).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next sign will be getting croaky, which makes you difficult to hear and unattractive to listen to. Then you'll lose your voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the first sign of damage (that tickle at the back of the throat):<br/>\n<br/>\n* Stop doing anything that's straining your voice, urgently. If you're calling across the stall, find another way to communicate.<br/>\n* Keep silent as much as possible. Take a break from the stall, if you can.<br/>\n* Take sips of water, to combat the need to cough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps. If you know about this stuff, do feel free to add comments. I'm also happy to answer questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156881/#Comment_156881" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T09:18:06+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  9:18AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham helped us with a vocal warm up and advice at Games Expo in the UK at the end of May and it was great.

Think before you speak. Most communication is nonverbal anyway, so you're going to be conveying a lot regardless. But think: do I really need to say all this? Oftentimes, a quick thought about what you really want to say can pare it down to essentials.<br>\n<br>\n2. Try to give as few instructions as possible. It confuses people to follow verbal instructions anyway, so have signage and handouts if possible.<br>\n<br>\n3. Speak from your lower lungs if addressing a group. In other words, as you raise your voice, don't clinch up the top of your throat to pitch your words higher: speak from the bottom of your lungs (use your stomach muscles to push the air out of your lungs): you can throw your voice across an auditorium nearly all day doing this.<br>\n<br>\n4. Smile.<br>\n<br>\n5. Get help from your fellow booth monkeys and rest your voice. Don't talk in your downtime: go read a newspaper or book. Let people know, politely, you need to rest your voice.<br>\n<br>\n6. Relax. The more nervous you are, the more likely you'll be to speak...again, slow down, relax, and choose your words carefully. Remember Clint Eastwood.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157860/#Comment_157860" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-22T05:51:02+00:00" title="July 22, 2008  5:51AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2008 5:52AM by Graham.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's great, Tony, I'm glad it was useful.<br><br>Z-Dog, that's good stuff. <br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158158/#Comment_158158" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-23T12:17:07+00:00" title="July 23, 2008 12:17PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite><br>3.

But learning to speak with good air support is a wondeful discovery--as long as you remember to do it, you can get twice the volume and projection at a fraction of the effort, and a fraction of the strain/fatigue to the vocal chords. A useful thing to learn, if you're concerned about speaking in public, over noise, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
