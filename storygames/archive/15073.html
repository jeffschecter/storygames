My InSpecters report will talk more about what happened in the game, and thoughts I had about the rules &amp; fiction afterward. I don't explain the rules too much. The Ghostbusters report is from my perspective as a non-GM, and as such will talk more about how the cool rules work and less about the whole story. I encourage the other players/GM to post their thoughts and perspectives and summaries!<br/><br/><b>InSpectres</b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305189.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>The InSpectres game started in a mostly-vacant office park in Beaverton, OR, where our new franchise of InSpectres, inc., was unpacking its mostly-ghost-hunting equipment. A bored Housing Authority worker informed them of a job on the complete other side of town, Gresham. Something about an infestation in a housing project, screams or something. "The super'll tell you about that, that's not my job," kind of thing.<br/><br/>After breaking down on the way and eventually getting the van back in working order, the crew made it to the dark and brooding project. The super wasn't there, but had left a bloody keyring hanging off his door along with a note saying to "let yourself in". Some sort of bat-creature flew out of the super's window, and the InSpectres caught a glimpse with their shoddy equipment.<br/><br/>They figured out the infestation was coming from the basement. A quick investigation ensued, with some sort of large-eyed, furry creature running around in the dark basement, eventually being trapped and spawning tiny humanoid bat-creatures. The InSpectres fled, and as they did, Chuck, the former IT guy, discovered the large creature was a...baby T-rex? They decided to let Chuck deal with it.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305188.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thoughts</b><br/><br/>-They blew through the Franchise dice. They were a 10-die team, so I set the Franchise dice to 20, thinking that would be about enough for a two-hour game (after character and franchise creation). It was enough for one hour, and they had gotten almost all of the Franchise dice before they ever got to the investigation.<br/><br/>-The game has a very specific structure (Get the Call, Research/Equip, Suit Up, Investigate, &amp; then post-session stuff), which I had laid out on the table for all to see. I don't remember the book saying anything about pacing that structure (as in, "When 1/4 of the Franchise dice are gone, move to the Investigation), though it seems like that would help the game build to a more natural climax. It's not a big deal, as now that I've run it once I can easily keep an eye on the dice and either remind players of the size of the pool, or just frame them into moving on when they look at me to say something. I'm wondering if other people who've played InSpectres feels it needs more of a heavy hand when it comes to pacing?<br/><br/>-I'd read advice about how to use Stress here on S-G, and as such every time I introduced something into the fiction (except for maybe once), and <i>every</i> time the players got a 3- on a roll, I hit them with Stress. It still wasn't enough--as I said, they blew through the game easily. One of the characters ended up with 3 Cool, and only 2 out of the 10 dice the franchise started with on its cards were used in the game. It wasn't a huge issue for the fun of the game, though I as GM had wished it'd been a little more difficult. I know next time that I need to keep using Stress as much as I did, but increase the number of dice (3 stress was as big as I hit 'em with).<br/><br/>-Confessionals got used a bit (I think we had 3 over the whole game), and I had a separate "Confessional" chair set up. One player wanted to do a Confessional right after another player, but since it was in the same scene I didn't let him (per the rules). I don't know that I explained Confessionals very well beyond "Well, we've all seen an episode of the <i>Real World</i>, right?" As such one of the Confessionals seemed a little off the mark, with the player simply describing how he had kept a piece of equipment that another player tried to throw away. I felt like maybe I hadn't communicated the purpose of Confessionals well.<br/><br/>All in all, a good game! I feel like it could really hum with a group that knows itself better (as with any game). I think I'll try to run it again around Halloween.<br/><br/><br/><b>Ghostbusters</b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305202.jpg"/><br/><br/>Well, first, Michael brought some amazing tactiles to the game, including:<br/><br/><br/>A custom-stickered Ghost Die for every player<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305201.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>Custom-made character booklets<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305199.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305200.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>Custom-made item/equipment cards<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305193.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305196.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305197.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>And, of course, a custom-made box (though I'm not sure what it is, my GB knowledge being weak)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305194.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>Tres cool.<br/><br/>The game was set in Portland in 2013, with 20% of the world's dead turning into ghosts every year. The game's system of Traits &amp; Talents helped me get a grip on my character really quickly. Especially, though, the Goal helped: who knew--player priorities in the early 80's? I wasn't even born yet!<br/><br/>Here's a breakdown, if you don't know:<br/><br/><b>Traits</b> (everyone has these ones)<br/>Brains<br/>Muscle<br/>Moves<br/>Cool<br/><br/>Each of these have a die rating associated with it, and the Ghostmaster (!) will tell you to roll one when you're trying to do something. Pretty standard.<br/><br/><b>Talents</b> (you pick these off a list or make 'em up)<br/>Brains - Accounting<br/>Muscle - Judo Student<br/>Moves - Attract Attention<br/>Cool - Rich Socialite<br/><br/>If your talent matters in a situation, you can add its extra dice to the appropriate roll.<br/><br/>And the <b>Goal</b> is just that, your character's general goal, which obviously keeps you focused and helped me define who my character was. Mine:<br/><br/>-Excitement seeker/Adrenalin Junkie<br/><br/>Anyway, the game went much like you'd expect if you've seen Ghostbusters or played InSpectres: after a kick-off scene where we got to blast a lowbie ghost while doing irrevocable damage to the business we were in, we got a vague note about a job, did some investigating in a hotel, and learned about a portal on the 4th floor to another dimension. After talking to the last person who went inside, and looking through the hotel's artwork acquisitions paperwork for the gallery on the 4th floor (I was so happy I got to do a full-on Accounting roll!), we figured out how to get into the alternate dimension. It looked like some sort of kung-fu movie paradise ("lots of fried pork"), but was actually a part of the Chinese Hell. The old Chinese ghost wanted to open his dimension into our world and take over, but, y'know, we blasted him and stuff.<br/><br/>It was actually really interesting to see that the structure of play of both InSpectres &amp; Ghostbusters were the same. InSpectres spells it out, Ghostbusters doesn't. Other than that, it's pretty similar. It's better to spell it out, but for a one-shot with people who were all familiar with GB, it didn't matter.<br/><br/>The last thing about GB that's cool is the Ghost Die. You roll it whenever you roll, and if it comes up a Ghost (a zero; the die goes from zero to five), some weird shit happens, usually involving ghosts, whether you succeeded or not. It made it feel like any roll could change the game, which was really nice to have to mix it up in an otherwise pretty traditional task-resolution game.<br/><br/>I was real happy with Ghostbusters. It seems like a great game to have around to pull out once every few years after watching Ghostbusters and drinking too many beers.<br/><br/>And, well...<br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/S7305191.jpg"/><br/><br/>Bill Murray's in your roleplaying game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342476/#Comment_342476" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T19:54:08+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  7:54PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2011 8:00PM by Hans_c-o.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pics fixed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342543/#Comment_342543" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T07:50:36+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  7:50AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2011 9:48AM by stupidgremlin.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, beaten to the AP punch. Work got piled on me yesterday so I couldn't finish typing up the AP (which, honestly, went into waaaaaaaay too much detail anyway). But hey, yours had pics!<br/><br/>I did like InSpectres quite a bit, but of course I'm a fan of octaNe, which isn't too different. I also thought we were getting the job dice fairly quickly, to the point where I'm wondering if we missed something in the rules about it? We probably should look again about how Cool works, too. In my case, I think the Stress was working rather effectively...if only because it kept piling up because of my poor rolls. At least my character didn't suffer too badly, or have a meltdown like some of the other characters.<br/><br/>And really, Ghostbusters is one of my favorite games of all time. One of those, "If you were stuck on a desert island, and could only bring three games..." selections. It does have some basic suggestions of adventure structure, though unlike InSpectres, it doesn't hold you to it. It really does mirror, in particular, the cartoons (which came slightly after the original RPG), where it was possible for characters to be dropped into adventures, or come across them by accident. Most of the structure comes with their "Routines," like the car-chase routine, going to court, etc., which, in retrospect, were probably TOO MUCH structure for the feel of the game. We were starting to use the car chase routine for about two steps, and then...well...a proton blast brought that to a quick end. Then, the way damage is handled has too little structure. A lot of those details are basically "the GM will decide" with some very broad examples (getting hit by an axe will do as little as one, and as much as ten Brownie Point loss).<br/>But yeah, it was pretty damned fun. I think I'll keep GB on hand for the GoPlay PDX events, just in case.<br/><br/>I'll probably post tomorrow about my ideas for updating GB to a more modern indie-game structure...not that I'd need to do much, but there's a few directions it could go, and I'll want to see what people think about some of the ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

That didn't seem right, but after double checking the book that was how we interpreted it.  <br/><br/>I totally found myself with "deer in the spotlight" syndrome with Inspectres, and I wasn't even sure where to take it.  Just like Ghosbusters with a different symbol?  Consciously not being Ghostbusters?

Other than that, it's pretty much perfect.</blockquote>\nI don't really think a relationship generator would be a good idea for Ghostbusters...it's kinda fun having a bunch of otherwise perfect strangers get thrown together, and having the inevitable personality conflicts that <i>don't</i> end up with characters trying to kill each other...instead just trying to keep the other in slime's way.<br/>But the idea for collaboratively building the franchise is a good idea. Maybe not quite like InSpectres, where it's relatively freeform, but maybe starting with a set number of points (depending on whether its a startup, part of a local chain, well-established, etc.), and they'd be distributed between location, public relations, transportation, equipment...and maybe research and staff? I seem to remember one of the earliest Ghostbusters video games had some sort of starting resource allocation, and I'd always be trying to save money by sticking my team in a VW bug. Maybe I'll steal some of the organization building ideas from the old <i>Ninjas &amp; Superspies</i>...<br/><br/>As for dealing with the rest of the rules, true, they really don't need much. Like I was saying on Sunday, I'm looking at having the die-rolls be similar to Lady Blackbird/all the other games where a die gives 50/50 chance of success/failure, and you'd have to beat (rather than meet or beat) a Difficulty or opposing roll. For set Difficulties, I'm thinking from 0 (all you need is one success!) to 6 (in which case most people are screwed). The Ghost Die would still be wild (so, since the Ghost is the 6, successes would be rolls of 1-3, failures 4-6).<br/><br/>Damage would still be Brownie Point loss (in combat, the difference between the two rolls, or for accidents, the original Difficulty), which I think could be mitigated by taking a Condition of equal value (so, for example, if you lost 3 Brownie Points from getting slimed, you could instead take a Condition of "Slippery 3" which would then...I guess add to the Difficulty where being slippery is a bad thing, and then reduce the Condition by 1 per instance, possibly?). You could still restore Brownie Points by 5 by taking a wound or stress (lowering a Trait by 1 to later be healed), or by 20 by taking an injury or trauma (lowering a Trait by 1 permanently).<br/><br/>Mechanically, it would work just about the same, while giving some more descriptive options, and allowing people like me to avoid having to add up massive amounts of dice.
