Rather than return the extra, I thought of something more fun and beneficial I could do with it.<br/><br/>I will offer a challenge to any and all comers. Three of them, in fact! You may choose one, two or all three! Any participant may have a maximum of one entry per challenge, and I will personally judge the games, though I would be happy to have help in that department! In the end, there can be only one victor, based on mechanics, sticking to theme, fun factor, and difficulty of the challenge selected. The winner will give me his/her address and I will post them my extra copy! Best of all, these three challenges are just a few of the 14 challenges from Chapter 1 of the book, so you know what you're getting (a bit). Post your designs (or designs in progress) here! Now on to the challenges themselves (in order from easiest to hardest, IMO, but feel free to challenge that opinion).<br/><br/>CHALLENGE 1: Develop a game and set of rules to be played in a public place by up to 50 players. You may incorporate teams into your design.<br/><br/>CHALLENGE 2: Create a game in any medium that simulates the ebb and flow of people during rush hour. The goal of the game, as well as the number of players, is entirely up to you.<br/><br/>CHALLENGE 3: Create a collectible card game of 100 different cards separated into packs of five that simulates the running of a radio station. Develop some kind of system that allows you to compete for listeners and reach the coveted <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> station milestone.<br/><br/>So there you have it! I haven't decided on a dealine yet, but there is no maximum number of participants, though each can necessarily only have a maximum of three entries. I was thinking of about a March 1st deadline, but if someone more experienced thinks more or less time would be better, we can do that too. Have fun, I look forward to your games!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352878/#Comment_352878" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-31T15:49:06+00:00" title="December 31, 2011  3:49PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see a way to fulfill all three at once, but I don't know if I'll pursue that path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
