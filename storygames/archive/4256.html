The question will not be if they succeed at the challenges or complete the journey, but rather of what they sacrifice to succeed.  Throughout the game, aspects of the "special friend" will be transformed and adopted by the character or even destroyed outright - in either case this is likely to be represented by the destruction of the friend's character sheet.  At the same time, the perceptions of the main character will be transformed....<br/><br/><b>September Morn \xe2\u20ac\u201c A Sight and Sound Game Design Challenge Entry</b><br/>(Concept A, Image B, Sound A)<br/><br/><i>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.        - 1 Corinthians 13:11</i><br/><br/>Prologue \xe2\u20ac\u201c Departure<br/><br/>You and your friends have played in The Fair Glen At The River\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Bend for as long as you can remember.<br/><br/><i>What is your name?  Personal Name only \xe2\u20ac\u201c no Family Names.</i><br/><br/>It is always sunny and pleasant here.  It only rains when you need it too for your games and the clouds always run away when you chase them.<br/><br/><i>What lives beyond the Glen that you fear?  Things only \xe2\u20ac\u201c no Concepts</i><br/><br/>You noticed something today.  Something that (most of) the other kids don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t see or at least they pretend not to see.  The leaves are changing from greens to yellows and reds and oranges.  And some of them have fallen from the trees.  Your special friend has noticed this too and seems somehow saddened.<br/><br/><i>Who is your special friend?  What thing (toy, character, other) are they based on? What are their personality traits? How do those personality traits manifest physically?</i><br/><br/>In the center of the Glen is the Great Oak, a kind old tree that is always happy to lend shade for lazy naps on sunny days and limbs for climbing.  Today, the Great Oak showed you something new \xe2\u20ac\u201c a cave hidden amongst her roots.<br/><br/><i>You can bring something special from the Glen with you when you enter the cave.  What is it?</i><br/><br/>The cave is deep and old.  It may take you several tries, but eventually you plumb it depths.  In its deepest chamber you find an ancient gate and three rusty keys.  {Image B - Characters will collect addition keys to open gates along their path throughout the game.}<br/><br/><i>Somehow, you know must choose one.  Which key do you take?</i><br/><br/>You thrust the key into the gate and turn it.   {Sound A is played here and will be played repeatedly during similar activities throughout the game.}<br/><br/>Stepping through the gate \xe2\u20ac\u201c you find yourself \xe2\u20ac\xa6 elsewhere\xe2\u20ac\xa6.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95630/#Comment_95630" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T15:35:15+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  3:35PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First impression: I really want to know why the children pretend not to notice the leaves turning colour. The children in this seem to be different from children I've known throughout my life - they are afraid of going outside their comfort zone, and don't eagerly await the leaves changing in fall. Is there an explanation for this contained within the game, or am I seeing an aspect that you didn't intentionally put into the game?<br/><br/>I'd be delighted to find out that, through play, I learned why the other children ignored the leaves changing colour.<br/><br/><br/>I'd also like to say: Your interpretation of that image as keys is hella cool. I saw grave markers, but looking back and seeing them as keys completely shifts the tone of the image and the possibilities contained within this contest.

With only four pages, I did not provide any commentary, but in reading your thoughts, that may be a good thing.  <br/><br/>I was going to provide my point of view here, but I think I will wait on that and see if I can express it in the game without being explicit.  That is to say, in my mind, the play explains why [you] saw the changing colours and others did not, but not necessarially explicitly.  I will take it as a challenge to make certain that the concept gets out of my mind and into the game.<br/><br/>WITH regards to the image, again, thanks.  I saw the numbers and the wreath and immediately thought of an address (which of course they are, just in a different sense).  Combined with the concept of a threshold and the tarot-interpretation/connotation of death, the rest of the game just started to fall together.<br/><br/>TO be honest, my biggest struggle right now is with the mechanics proper.  I think I want some degree of randomness, but I want to keep it simple and low-investment.  After noodling last night, this is where I stand.<br/><br/>DURING the game proper, the character will face a number of challenges.  The challenges are rated in numbers of dice and the number of dice will generally increase as the story progresses.<br/><br/>BY way of example, I will use the first challenge upon entering the City of Gates.  {Which needs a better name.}<br/>The character faces three manifestations of the fear identified in the prologue.  This is a single challenge, rated in three dice.  The character (currently) has two traits they can bring to bear: the special item they brought from the woods and their fear of the creatures.  For each trait, they get one die, for a total of two dice.  {As I type this, it feels like allowing for an optional 'fan mail' economy may be in order.}  They describe their actions and specifically how they apply the traits. Both sides roll their dice and arrange from high to low.  <br/>The side with the single highest value gains the upper hand, with ties leading to comparison of the next die, etc.<br/>IF the character has the highest value, they win the challenge and get to narrate how the scene plays out.<br/>IF the opposition has the highest value, the character's special friend appears and gets involved in the conflict.  CHOOSE a trait that the special friend applies and roll additional dice on the character's side, one at a time, until the character gets the upper hand.  The character now wins, but the opposition narrator gets to describe how the scene plays out and at what cost to the special friend.  The special friend losses the trait they used to help the character, but there is also a physical manifestation of this loss.<br/>Following the conflict, several things happen.<br/>(1) An additional key appears that will allow the character to pass through a new gate. <br/>(2) The character gets an additional trait based on how the conflict played out:<br/>     (2a) If the character won outright, they get to add a trait based on their chosen action, strategy, or skill that led to thier success.<br/>     (2b) If the special friend got involved and rolled fewer dice than the character did originally (in the case of the first challenge, less than 1 die), the character gains a positive transformation of the trait the special friend used as they adopt that trait for themselves.<br/>     (2c) If the special friend got involved and rolled as many or more dice than the character did originally, the character gets a negative transformation of the trait.<br/>(3) The character goes through a physical transformation based on the challenge.  If they won outright, they shift toward the more positive aspects of adulthood.  If they won with thier special friend's aid, they shift toward the more mundane aspects of adulthood.<br/><br/>All of that feels more wordy than I want, given the space limitations; but it captures my intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95839/#Comment_95839" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T06:51:42+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  6:51AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, failure will always be expressed on someone else, then? (ie, the special friend)<br/><br/><br/>it'd be nice if there was some sort of tactical decision that could be made that avoids hurting the special friend. Like... maybe you can nix one of your own traits to automatically succeed at a gate?<br/><br/>Making a Sacrifice: Remove any one trait from your own list to automatically succeed at a challenge. You may do this after rolling, before depending on your special friend for help.<br/><br/>I think that having a way - even a small way - to not put that kind of weight on your friend... to take matters into your own hands... would be a super key feature in a young adult fantasy game.<br/><br/><br/>I think this is cool.

With each gate passed through, the City awakes and more inhabitants begin to appear.  The nature of the City should reflect the transforming character.  If the character is becoming strong and noble, the City should be brighter and cleaner.  If the character is becoming dark and twisted, the City should reflect this.<br/><br/>The first challenge any character faces upon passing through the gate is the Challenge of Fear.  Three manifestations of the fear identified in the Prologue challenge the character.  This is a three die challenge.  Though a physical conflict is the most obvious solution, other solutions are possible \xe2\u20ac\u201c evasion, intimidation, bravery.  Remember that the choice of solution will color the trait gained and the associated physical transformation.<br/><br/>The next three challenges will vary.  Choose three from the examples provided, or create one or more of your own.  Typically, each challenge is one die higher than the previous.<br/><br/>The Challenge of Stealth:  A woman has been locked out of her home and asks the character to help her get back inside.  The problem is that she has a large guard dog that the character needs to sneak past.  The dog is indeed large, just happens to have three heads, but also incorporates aspects of the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fear. If the character tries a direct assault, roll normally but they can fail \xe2\u20ac\u201c their special friend will not involve themselves in a combat challenge with this beast.  Failure results in the character being ejected and needing to try a different tact.  If the character tries stealth, or any other non-combat strategy, the standard challenge rules apply. Upon success, they open the woman\xe2\u20ac\u2122s house from the inside and she gives them an old key she has laying around by way of thanks.<br/><br/>The Challenge of the Errand Runner:  The character encounters a well-to-do woman on the street outside of the next gate.  She has a package that she needs delivered and asks the character to do the errand.  She warns the character that others may try to take the package and asks them to guard it cautiously.  There are a number of potential specific challenges here.  Another inhabitant \xe2\u20ac\u201c possibly an older child who had left the Glen before the character \xe2\u20ac\u201c suggests that the character open the package and split the contents with them.  Or for a more physical conflict, three manifestations of the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fear will set upon them to try to take the package. Upon success, the receiver, a woman who is apparently the original woman\xe2\u20ac\u2122s twin, gives the character a key as a reward.<br/><br/>The Challenge of Temptation: As the character works toward the next gate, they pass an alley full of tempting smells.  (If their special friend currently has a favorite food or indulgence as a trait, then that indulgence is readily apparent.)  Investigation reveals a brightly colored market with all manner of food, drink, and other pleasures.  Everything appears to be free.  The challenge here is one of moderation.  If the special friend has an indulgence as a trait, this is a challenge that can be failed as the special friend is distracted by their own temptation and will not intervene to guarantee success.  Failure means that the character has been drawn off the main road and now must pass two additional challenges to complete their journey.  One challenge to replace this failed challenge and then one more for a total of four between the Challenge of Fear and the final challenge.<br/><br/>The Challenge of Past Shadows:  Not everyone makes their way successfully through the City of Gates.  Those who lose their special friend and have all their traits stripped away become permanent residents \xe2\u20ac\u201c and threats \xe2\u20ac\u201c in the City.  The character encounters three former residents of the Glen who either gave into gluttony, greed, or rage.  They will attempt to tempt or goad the character into joining them in their fate.  The former residents of the Glen explain how everyone sees autumn at a different time and how the City is their reward for their actions in the Glen \xe2\u20ac\u201c and how the final gate means their ultimate destruction.  They believe that hidden somewhere in the City is a path back into the Glen.<br/><br/>The Final Challenge \xe2\u20ac\u201c Janus the Gatekeeper:  The specific nature and appearance of the final challenge will depend on the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s choices and traits gained as they traveled through the city.  The challenge will be rated in one more die than the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s last challenge and the character will have to garner two successes to win.  The character can fail if they can not or choose not to sacrifice one of their traits for a re-roll or to allow their special friend to sacrifice themselves.  If they win, they gain all of the benefits of succeeding a standard challenge.  If they fail, they are given the choice to either travel the City some more and try again or to sacrifice their special friend entirely to earn the key to the final gate.  <br/><br/>Apotheosis and the Ultimate Boon<br/><br/>As they pass through the final gate, the character undergoes on final transformation to their full adult form.  If their special friend survived the journey through the city, they also get one final additional trait selected from the rewards trait.  In this case, describe the joyous and likely successful life they have as an adult, culminating in the introduction of their child into the Glen.<br/><br/>If their special friend did not survive the journey, describe their mundane life and the material rewards, if any, they have as an adult, culminating in their lack of understanding as their child discovers the Glen on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97401/#Comment_97401" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T20:17:19+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  8:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am going to play this game in the near future.
