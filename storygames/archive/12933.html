That's a lot to digest. I can see there being a lot of stress or personal difficulty to overcome and post new topics and the like.<br/><br/>I'm hoping to make more threads like "Autumn Gaming" and the like, where people can just post cool stuff to it without feeling that they need to pass through a social gauntlet to do so.<br/><br/>Also, I need to change up the "You need to register to join S-G" page: I still love registration, it does a good job of keeping away flakes or resentful folks looking for a soapbox. It effectively kills spammers dead. But I need to make the message more welcoming, not so much "Post why you think we should let you in", but rather, "This is a Turing test to make sure you're not an MMO gold spammer. But tell us something about yourself so we know where you're coming from."<br/><br/>One of the troubling things I've seen in S-G registration is this: About 60% of the folks join with something to the extent of, "Hey I want to post here", or "I've been lurking, and want to join". But about 40%, and again this is a feeling not a calculation (it could be more) of the reg notes are like, "Hey, I'm working on a game!" "I've got an RPG I'm working on and want feedback!" etc. NOW, most of those people who join iwth the latter might post about their game or whatever, and many stick around to basically talk about Play and stuff like all the rest of us. And yet, joining a community like this, folks have an assumption I'm trying to kill, which is:<br/><br/>1) You have to be working on a design to be noticed/accepted (in fact, recently the opposite is true)<br/>2) That you're going to get solid feedback here (rather than Praxis, The Forge, etc).<br/><br/>I'm still thinking, slowly, of ways to make the site easier for new users to post (threads like the "what are you playing?" "what do you love?" etc are awesome in that regard), cleaning up the feel of the registration page, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy</blockquote>\nHere's what I think is really going on: there's a community, most of whom design games or think about game design a lot, even if they're not actively designing anything. They also like to play games, of course. <br/><br/>Other sites specifically about game design fell out of fashion. People came here. Despite the admonition that Story Games is about play, lots of the emergent SG culture became about design, partially due to the rather laid-back modding of the site.<br/><br/>Now Andy's all "No really! I mean it! This is for PLAY! Go to Praxis for game design!" And on the surface we're all like, "Heck yeah! Play! Screw design!" Except that, of my current count, 20 of the threads on the front page (including Andy's "Help me find manga for Tenra" thread) are about designing games, game designers, or game mechanics. <br/><br/>Praxis doesn't have the eyeballs Story Games does; I don't know why the migration didn't take, possibly because it's just another forum to check, and the modding here is very laid-back, as I said. So you can follow the spirit of the rules and post in Praxis, or you can post here and no one will complain.<br/><br/>This whole "No design here" thing is <i>clearly</i> not what the community wants, because when presented with rules and alternatives, the community still posts their design stuff here. As well as the play stuff. You can make the play stuff more prominent with the kinds of threads you're talking about, but without an iron fist this is always going to look like a game designer forum to people on the outside. It's a big part of what gets talked about here, so <i>of course</i> people will join wanting to talk about what they're working on. <br/><br/>My two cents.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291396/#Comment_291396" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T10:33:08+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 10:33AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...Actually, I forget Praxis is even <i>there</i>, and have lost my account info.<br/><br/>This isn't about wanting, for me; it's just about habit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291398/#Comment_291398" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T10:40:33+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 10:40AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's about audience, right?

You might not actually go and design a game, but you might talk about a game design element and implement it in a houserule for a game you otherwise like. Makes for a rather appropriate discussion. There's also likely the fact that if everyone is about game design they'll be about designing their own games so it's much harder to find someone to playtest it on a dedicated design forum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291401/#Comment_291401" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T10:43:31+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 10:43AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It always seemed to me like Praxis was where you took your game to do group development, try to work out problems, and focus on one game in development.

Or at least comparison across a small set of games.   So the kind of discussion about play I like is heavily rooted in discussion of design.<br/><br/>BUT!<br/><br/>I think there's a difference between Game Creation and Game Play design discussion.<br/><br/>Game Creation:  Given this description of game play I'd like to facilitate, how do I design to that experience?<br/><br/>Game Play: Given this game's design, how do I utilize it to maximum effect?<br/><br/>I would like to see more of the later.

Is this good or bad? I don't know. I don't participate much in the design threads, I don't think. Or the play threads. (Maybe my perceptions are skewed for my own participation, but anyway, I don't feel particularly INVESTED in talking about one vs. the other.) <br/><br/>I'm just saying, the designless, playful utopia is not something I see happening soon, and I think that making it happen would take more energy and moderation and self-curation than Andy and the community are willing to commit to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291415/#Comment_291415" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T11:12:39+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 11:12AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2010 11:15AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe we just need to very subtly nudge people in the right direction...<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/takeittopraxis.gif"/><br/>I'm often tempted to say this, but I never do, because I think it shuts down conversations and I sorta like Praxis small and focused.

This was originally the place for Forge folks to talk about gaming in general non-theory ways, exactly like the old "Forge Birthday Forum". So even here, early on, while there was a stated goal of "gaming discussion", there was still lots of idle chatter, marketing talk, design discussions, etc. And there were even actual entire design contests within the site for the first few years.<br/><br/>It wasn't until later that I started trying to find a way to split off the "from the ground up" ("Hey guys, can someone help me with this dice resolution mechanic?" "Hey, here's my game idea, what do you think?") threads from the forum, simply because about three or four years in, they started drowning out the other conversations. Due to a clear limitation of the forum (which I think I just came up with an idea for a solution, huh. Probably too late to be helpful, but will throw it by Dev later*), the discussions couldn't be easily "moved to the side".<br/><br/>I didn't want to just say "no more design". Well, actually, I kinda did, but enough people from all walks of life kept asking about it, so I figured it could use its own space rather than me saying "stop that" each time it came up.<br/><br/>I do think that idle talk about marketing and "what motivates you to design?" and the like is "design focused", and on an aggregated level probably makes the site seem design focused. I'm not ready to throw that bathwater out yet, though, even though it would be the Final Move to make this place Play Only. If the site gets as overrun with marketing/idle-designer-talk as it was a year or so ago with "help me with my game" posts, then yeah I'll aim at those next. But for now, it seems to be a thing that comes and goes in waves, usually around major cons. So I'm keeping an eye on those threads, which are a majority of the 20-some threads counted.<br/><br/>So, actually what the heck (TextPad, Macro, Copy, Select, Delete, Data Gather'd), here's all the threads on the front page, and I'll single out the ones that I'm talking about:<br/><br/>=========================<br/>The Master Story-Games Meetup and Events Directory [ 1 2 ]<br/>The Rules and Purpose of Story Games<br/>The Cult of the Designer/Creator/Whatever [ 1 2 ]<br/>The Hunger Games<br/><b>Game Chef 2010: Sept 11th-19th</b> <b>&lt;-- Promotion/Announcement.&lt;/b&gt;<br/><b><span style="color: #FF0000;">Classes cuing other classes to be awesome</span></b>.<br/><b><span style="color: #FF0000;">Yet another D&amp;D hommage</span></b><br/>Your First Love<br/><b>Embossing, foil etc. on small press games?</b><br/>The awesome thing about Shadowrun<br/>Story Games and Design vs. Play<br/>Stuff to Watch: September 2010<br/><b>whats your game design OCD?</b><br/>How do you organize a game on Skype, including the very first steps?<br/>SG Diplomacy League, Game 4 [ 1 2 3 ]<br/>[Freemarket] Post your WTFs here!

Oh, wait, there it is under, what! "Game Design?"</blockquote>\nYeah, I took a cue from some discussion on inclusive speak, etc. I love the words Codex; Praxis. But after about the third person going "Oh, there's a Wiki? Oh there's a Design Forum? I didn't realize what those words meant, so I never clicked them", I realized that was <b><i>on me to fix</i></b>, not them to "learn". So, fixed!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I imagine Andy doesn't have anything against wide-audience game design discussion on Story Games but that Praxis is intended to siphon off those in-depth threads which might otherwise spin out of control or get buried (Andy, correct me if I'm off base here?).</blockquote>\nYeah, it was meant to siphon the "help me with my design" posts. Which it looks like it did, for the most part there. There's still a lot of ephemeral design-ish/designer talk, which I'm lazily wondering what to do. Hasn't become a real problem IMO yet, drowning out other discussion and the like. But if it starts to, I'll give it another look. More than the designer/design idle talk is the marketing discussions, which are clearly designer-only focused (even when they're room for thoughts from others, like in the Emboss thread, the "Story Games Collection Hardcover" thread, the "Review Copies" thread, etc.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>I'm just saying, the designless, playful utopia is not something I see happening soon, and I think that making it happen would take more energy and moderation and self-curation than Andy and the community are willing to commit to.</blockquote>\nThis is absolutely true. I wasn't ever really going for "Halting all design/designer/etc discussion" anyway, it was mostly pruning the "Help me with my game design/Let me talk about my game design" threads. But even if I decided to go with tearing out the Marketing, Designer-focused talk and smash that into another subforum Praxis, etc), that's more energy and moderation... and in the end, "...and for what?" <br/><br/>* Some people are annoyed when the lines aren't even ("Why is that allowed and not this? Why is this discussion allowed but not that?" etc). I have <b>nooooooo</b> interest in correcting that with RPGNet-style "moderation by rules" administration.<br/><br/>* Allowing any design discussion (not just the "help me" threads, but the discussions started by designers on designery-things") increases the chances of people thinking of this as a "design forum". While true, and while I'm observing it for a bit now, I don't think it's something that needs to be controlled or killed. Yet.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Maybe we just need to very subtly nudge people in the right direction...</blockquote>\nI (and others) do this a lot through Whispers. A suggestion of "Hey man, that's what that Praxis Game Design forum is for" is usually enough to get people to jump over there.<br/><br/>On Jason's note, while I encourage people to use that forum, I don't come out and "slam discussions shut" or anything, or make public moderation calls (that often), etc. Mostly because Praxis is its own database, and I can't easily just "click it" over to the other DB like I can a discussion here from one Category to the next: That's a shame, otherwise it would have been far more easy to mod such discussions: I'd have simply popped all those Red Threads to the other forum. If, in the future, this board moves to a new forum software where such a thing is possible, you'll see a lot more modding to that effect (and hell, I've even considered going to vBulletin/phpBB to make it work easier. Both those forum softwares are honey for spammers, though).<br/><br/>But again, I'm not looking for the heavy hand of RPGNet style rules-based modding, or getting into any of those discussions of why X is ok but not Y, etc. Anything that increases the amount of time I need to read threads I'm not interested in reading, or mod people/threads, is not something I'm terribly interested in. I gotta weigh that with the direction I want to see the site go. *shrugs*<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291456/#Comment_291456" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T14:11:25+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  2:11PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>The<span style="color: #FF0000;"><b>Red</b></span>highlighted ones are the "help<b>Me</b>with<b>My</b>game";"let me talk about<b>My</b>design" threads.</blockquote>\nSince one of those was mine I figured I'd comment. I put it into "Little Ideas" which has the description of \n<blockquote>This is a place to discuss those "Hey, this would be cool to do/try/make" gaming ideas that you have, where you just don't feel like writing a lot about them. Like a dart board for your creativity.</blockquote>\nThe reason I was throwing it there was because it's an idea, but realistically, game design is a lot of hard work, and actually making a game is entirely different. It'll probably never manifest to anything, but it's fun to throw the darts out. I'm also half interested in seeing if it's been done already, as most of the ideas I come up with already have been done, and I'll now be keeping my eye out for the original Empire of the Petal Throne on the used game shelves as it's what I was thinking about. Kind of a "Here's an idea for a game" with a "Check this out, it already does it, or has a different take on it." I've done that quite a few times, and often the result is I end up with a bunch more RPGs to track down and read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291466/#Comment_291466" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T15:19:41+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  3:19PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy cow there's a wiki!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291468/#Comment_291468" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T15:36:06+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  3:36PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timonkey</cite>Holy cow there's a wiki!</blockquote>\nYeah, exactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291477/#Comment_291477" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T17:10:16+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  5:10PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Some people are annoyed when the lines aren't even ("Why is that allowed and not this?

I'd like SG to continue to be about Play.<br/><br/>If we want to encourage/remind of traffic at Praxis: do we want a monthly thread like "[Game Design] What's up at Praxis: September 2010"? Keep it to one thread as per the Stuff To Watch, but add a little bit more flow/crossover.<br/><br/>But perhaps a heavy amount of design chatter is a key part of this cluster of people, and that's just where a lot of the the energy is.

This dovetails with the biggest problems I've noticed with Praxis, which is traffic/readership.
