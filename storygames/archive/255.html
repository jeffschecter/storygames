                    I think a common way to talk about setting stakes is talking about having stakes that are interesting either way. That is, whether the character in questions succeeds or fails, something interesting happens.  <br/><br/>A moment from my playtest of Carry last night kind of realigned my thinking on the matter, and now I'm thinking that thats more an <i>effect</i> of good stakes-setting. A character was holding his gun to the head of a Vietnamese child, trying to bluff the papa-san into telling him the truth about NVA in the area. Conflict! He said "if I win, the guy spills and I don't have to go farther." I said "and if you lose, you do have to go farther before he spills." He pulls this face and says "I don't want that." I say "well, I want that. Let's roll 'em." And, what-da-ya-know, he did all he could to keep from losing that conflict, engaging fully with the conflict resolution mechanics in the game.<br/><br/>So. This clarifies for me that good stakes setting aren't just whats <i>interesting</i>, but that they have to be <i>things that people want</i>. Sometimes its the same person that wants both options. Sometimes different people want different options. Sometimes you have to fight to get what you want. But as long as sometime is attached to each option, thats what makes the stakes interesting.<br/><br/>I'm sure this is very much a "duh" moment, but I'm glad that my play clarified it for me.                </div>

                            Yup. I agree. I think this is part of what Matt Snyder, John Kim, and I were trying to talk about in another thread, but weren't quite connecting on because of some semantic issues.<br/>
<br/>
"Engaging fully" are the key words, to me. Words like "agree" and "want" kind of muddy things, I think. The important thing is, the players involved are fully engaged. What makes a player engage fully? There's no single answer. Sometimes it's a kind of authorial curiosity -- "Oooh, this could go several different ways! Neat". Sometimes it's desperate character-identification -- "Oh no! My guy definitely doesn't want that. C'mon, let's win this one!" And there are several other ways, and most players switch between them all.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, some of these ways probably rub some people the wrong way, and hurt engagement.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's worth it to be very explicit about the different methods of engagement, and which ones you want and don't want. I suspect that there's some overlap here with "No one gets hurt" and "I will not abandon you."                        </div>

                            This is actually something that I was talking about with two different sets of people, recently.  I'm finding that it's important to recognize that "Conflict Resolution" and specifically what constitutes the stakes in a conflict resolution system are specific to individual games.<br><br>Case in point: Dogs works best without counterstakes.  In Dogs, stakes are defined as <em>what the Dog wants</em> and if the Dog wins, he gets them, and if he loses, he doesn't.  The NPC on the other side does not get stakes of his own because, in the scheme of how the game works, the NPC is not on an equal narrative footing as the PC, and what the NPC "wants" is more or less irrelevant outside of how the NPC's desires reveal the situation.  In Dogs, the rules are all about putting the players in a position where they must take a moral stance on a complicated situation.<br><br>However, FLFS has very explicit counterstakes.  Any check is all about "if win, you narrate X happens, if lose I narrate Y happens."  Because in this game, the die checks are all about moving the story forward and hot-potatoing the narration rights.<br><br>Both are "Conflict Resolution" but they are not the <em>same</em> Conflict Resolution.  So the important question to ask is "what does Carry need its Resolution to forward?"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I like the idea of the GM or another player writing the "but if you lose..." stakes against the player's "if I win..." stakes. This would work in Dogs, too.<br/>
<br/>
Player: "If I win, the kid with the axe lets me past and tells me how to free the captives from the evil contraption."<br/>
GM: "Are you willing to kill the kid?"<br/>
Player: "I don't want to harm him."<br/>
GM: "If you lose, you free some or all of the captives before the machine mangles them, and you kill the kid."                        </div>

                            Actually, I find counterstakes to be <em>poison</em> to a Dogs game.  Killing the kid is what fallout is there for.  The kid will die if you decide to push so hard that it becomes dangerous.<br/><br/>The thing of it is, killing the kid needs to be a <em>decision</em> made by the Dogs rather than a <em>failure</em> of the Dogs.  Framing it as a decision gets into good, juicy Dogs play -- "how important is it that your flavor of justice is done here?  Enough to kill a kid?"  Framing it as a failure kills a lot of what drives Dogs -- "you tried hard, but the kid died.  Them's the breaks."  Both approaches have a unique flavor.<br/><br/>Which is mostly what I'm getting at -- specific means of implementing conflict resolution have specific consequences to the experience of play.<br/><br/>{Tangent: The captives getting mangled is either setting the stakes right the first time and/or a followup conflict against demonic influence.  Actually, I'd argue that the status of the captives is pretty much a non-issue in a Dogs games.  The point is what you do with the kid, not how safe the victims are.  Dogs are judges, not heroes.)                        </div>

                            Joshua, I want to respond to you that the problem with the example isn't with setting counterstakes--it's with using the conflict to negate the players' moral choice and, thereby, remove their chance to pass judgment.  The whole point of setting counterstakes is to create an interesting alternative to winning, and killing the kid <i>is not interesting.</i><br/>
<br/>
In the Dogs game I'm running now, I've set counterstakes on almost every conflict--including even one healing conflict (not "does he die" but "do you save him in time to help her?").  So far it's been anything but poison.  Unfortunately, since I've only won two conflicts in two months of play, it's possible my sample size isn't large enough.                        </div>

                            Exactly. That's why I got all flustered by terms like "disagree" or "doesn't want." Judd, you're dead on. There's a BIG difference between "I will fight tooth and nail to win this conflict because it is what I am passionate about" and "If I lose this, the game will suck."<br/>
<br/>
I think what Nathan is getting at is setting stakes that make people go "Oh crap! No way! I'm going all out to get my way now!" -- <i>without actually "disagreeing" with the counter stakes</i>.<br/>
<br/>
How can we make stakes like that happen?                        </div>

                            When offering counterstakes, you say, "Will the game suck, if THIS happens if you lose?

                            I think that kind of "will the game suck if..." questions are only really necessary when you are first setting stakes together.  Once the group gets into a groove, it shouldn't usually be a problem, especially if the group is involved in the stake setting.                        </div>

I think with stakes setting you've got to keep an eye out and the players have to differentiate and make sure the communication lines are wide open.                        </br></br></div>

                            Vax: This might be off topic. Not sure. But why did you have to take a "resists mind control" trait? If it's a game-smashing thing for you, shouldn't Mike and the others just drop it and not bring it up in scenes with your character?<br/>
<br/>
Having the trait <b>is</b> a flag that you want to use it. If you don't want it to be part of the game, tell everyone it's off-limits (which it sounds like you did). Done and done.                        </div>

Nate, what mechanics does Carry have to enforce the GM's ability to set Counterstakes?  Does it say, anywhere, explicitly in the rules that the GM gets to set them and the players have to go along with it no matter if they like it or not?<br/>
<br/>

                            John: I took it  because the player base in Mike's game is VERY fluid.  New people are entering the game all the time, and many of them are wizards.  There are a LOT of wizards in Mike's game (the system rewards it) and more than one of them have taken mental powers; mentalism is an explicit 'flavor' of magic.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a briefing, every time a new player joins the game, "Look, don't do this to him, or that with him, or this that and the other with her?"  I took the trait in an attempt to say, "Find a target elsewhere,"  on the assumption that someone who takes mind-control magic for their character wants to actually SUCCEED at it.                        </div>

                            Ok, two things. My main point, my duh moment, is that, in my experience, its that stakes that people care about are interesting, as opposed to interesting stakes somehow make people care about them.  I <i>realized</i> it in that game of Carry, but, now that I think about it, it has applied to most of my play experience since I started playing games with conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Secondly, to answer Troy's question: all that Carry says about stakes setting is that once a conflict has been established, you set the stakes for winning and losing the conflict for each character in it. There's also a big note to myself that says "explain conflict resolution" for the actual published text.<br/><br/>How I've been <i>playing</i> it, is once we have a conflict, we go through a round of "If you win....and if you lose..." with the player in question filling in the blanks, usually with input from other players. A couple times, I've jumped in as GM with a "if you lose" that they wouldn't have put in themselves. It's inconsistent and situational, so far.                        </div>

                            I'm quite new in setting the stakes. I begin to really learn how to do it with The Pool some weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
But what I have so far noticed is that when I fix counter-stakes and a player says "No! No way!", we probably have set too high stakes. <br/>
Many times it worked better to re-think the stakes and find something which make easier to create follow-up conflicts. Mainly stakes and counter-stakes that make the player and the GM feel comfortable, and even interested on both possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Am I not getting something important?<br/>

                            Arturo - No. I'm sure you're doing fine. But, to complicate things (in a useful way), look back at Judds statement:<br/><br/>[code]I think there's a difference between "I dont want that" and "that will eff up the game for me" and its a big difference that needs to be addressed.[/code]<br/><br/>What I'm talking about is when the player goes "Oh shit, I don't want <i>that</i> to happen! I will use the tools given to me by this game to their fullest extent to make that other thing I care about happens instead!" It's when they reach for the dice as they curse your name - that's stakes they care about.<br/><br/>When something comes up and the player just sits there with crossed arms, shaking his head, until you change the stakes - thats "eff up the game for me." That's social contract stuff, in my mind - you need to resolve it outside the rules of the game. <br/><br/>Does that make more sense?<br/><br/>Joshua - well, I'll make a coherent sentence out of it. Then it'll go into Carry.                        </div>

<br/>
I think that's a good point, but it can come into the mechanics of a game in a number of ways. For example, in Unsung, everyone has an explicit veto power over pretty much everything that has to do with their protagonist, and the GM has veto power over a lot of stuff too. In Carry, on the other hand, the text directs the group to talk about their lines, in terms of fictional material/issues, that they don't want to see crossed in play. Once play starts, there's no mechanical recourse. Thats a conscious design decision on my part.                        </div>

The danger in the way Carry does it, is that sometimes you don't know the line is there until it's crossed.  It was a major epiphany for me, when I figured out why I didn't want Okhfels mind-controlled, and it didn't happen until the topic had come up several times.                        </div>

                            I think the distinction between "no, not that, here, I'll spend resources" and "no, not that, it would spoil my fun" is important , though I'm not sure the issue can't usually be handled by the same mechanic.<br/>
<br/>
Also, while I don't really like post-facto resource mechanics ("I'll just spend my token to nullify this botch/change this result"), when used to stop character-unpleasant (but interesting and engaged) results, I feel the opposite way about using them to avoid "fun destroying" results.  Part of this, I think, is that it may not be obvious that a no-fun result is possible or likely until the dice hit the table.<br/>
<br/>
Also, what possibilites are there for stake-setting systems that still allow for a surprise result that nobody expected?  Is PTA stake overlap sufficient? Does it make sense to throw a "here be dragons" result into a system under some situations?                        </div>

                            All these old threads I'm resurrecting, I feel like a cleric.<br/><br/>Dogs gets so many mentions here that I went and read about it - Wikipedia, on its site, and the various reviews linked from there. My "duh moment", which I'd now like to check out with you, went something like this.<br/><br/>What people seem to like about Dogs are two things. One, that it presents a setting - or rather, a <i>setup</i> - in which moral choices matter, not only subjectively but to everyone and the universe at large. And two (which is the bit that's relevant to this thread): that when a player commits to a course of action, the question that's asked is not "do you succeed?" but "<i>what's it worth to you</i>?"<br/><br/>This same idea seems to come up in other games written by people who post here, like Capes or the Roach (it's pretty clear in the Roach's kicker*, and I misquote: Would you swallow a giant telepathic cockroach that wants to take over the world, <i>if it would get you tenure</i>?)<br/><br/>"What's it worth to you?" seems to come in two flavours: "What are you willing to risk?" (the Gambler's Question) and "What are you willing to pay?" (the Trader's Question). And each of them has two forms: the non-escalating and the escalating. The escalating form of the trader's question is an auction; the escalating form of the gambler's question is as per Dogs. And the key to escalation is "OK, you're willing to risk/pay X. What if someone else values getting their outcome at X+1? Still interested? Can you better that offer?"<br/><br/>And all that makes you think about value and cost and reward, and it's engaging, much more so than bashing monsters and taking their stuff.<br/><br/>So, is this a worthwhile/accurate insight? And if so, how might we use it in our games?<br/><br/>*Hopefully I am using the terminology correctly, I'm new to this.                        </div>

                            Definitely worthwhile. What do you think the effective difference between escalating and non-escalating (flat?) are? Is escalating always more interesting, or can the finality of a flat bid/trade have its own purpose?                        </div>
