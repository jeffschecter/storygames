So below is the quote, and I'll follow up with my response.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><cite>Posted By: jprussell</cite><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I'd have offered 20 \u20ac gift tokens in exchange for AP a long time ago if I didn't consider paid AP a form of Internet community spamming.</blockquote>\nHmmm, a) is this different from offering a full/partial refund to folks who buy your game when they post AP, and b) if that is different, would you still consider it spamming/shilling/et cetera? What about if the reward is not straight up pecuniary, but rather added game-related goodness (you get the exclusive AP writers' supplement!)<br/><br/><br/>This is really a separate topic - you should start a new thread if you'd like to talk this over in length. I'll answer this shortly from my viewpoint, feel free to quote me if you want to start a new thread with a bang <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I don't really see a difference between forms of payment here; they all basically lower the threshold of posting artificially, causing communication that is privately motivated - not that private motivation is bad by definition (just look at playtest posting at the Forge), but when that private motivation is one without sympathy from the community all you're doing as advertiser is exploiting a medium not intended for what you're doing. I'm not even touching the issue of how this influences the contents or interpretation of the paid AP report; it is sufficient to know that this is material that would not have been written out of the motivations usually assumed for AP, such as excitement over the game or whatnot. Not that different from paid reviewing to my mind, really. (Do note that mine is apparently a minority viewpoint - most games media assumes that reviews should be paid for in free product if nothing else.)<br/><br/>Indies need all the good angles they can get, and being proactive about encouraging our primary form of publicity, word of mouth, is an attractive proposition. What the eager beawer might not realize is that the reason for why actual play reports are effective is because they are genuine communications pre-filtered by the notability threshold of the AP author; in other words, only the noteworthy sessions get AP reports, which is a part of why the reader might bother to read the report in the first place. Advertisement business has ever since its invention worked by flogging the public communications landscape, stealing attention and trust from legitimate forms of communication; the great men of advertising are often the ones who figured out how to make the jump to new medias or new modes of communication that bypass the cynicism and personal filters of the audience. From this historical perspective it's obvious that actual play reports are an attractive, lucrative advertising media simply because anybody spending their advertising money on AP will be exploiting public benefits developed in a non-commercialized medium of communication: even as it decreases public trust in the AP report institution, your paid actual play report will gain more attention, trust and goodwill from the audience than a normal paid advertisement would merit. Of course a wide-spread practice of paying for AP would soon weaken the benefits of the practice, just like all forms of advertisement have reduced in value as they've become established and the audience has learned to disregard them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290566/#Comment_290566" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T14:32:49+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  2:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yuck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290568/#Comment_290568" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T14:33:50+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  2:33PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, I'm personally not anywhere near the phase of pushing hard to promote a game, so this is mostly abstract to me at this point. So anybody with real experience promoting games, please take my comments with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>Now, I'm of mixed feelings here. On the one hand, I think that the idea that advertising and otherwise commodotizing existing forms of communication cheapens them is rather insightful and almost definitely true. That being said, I'm also a rabid American capitalist pig dog, who's all about the free market (I've got a shiny new boxed game to prove it) and incentivizing behavior we want to see and apparently adding "izing" to the end of nouns to make buzz words (if it was good enough for Plato, it's good enough for me).<br/><br/>More seriously, I feel like there has to be some way to provide an incentive to do AP reports that does not in and of itself encrappen AP reporting in general. Certainly, genuine AP reports are the product of an enthusiastic roleplayer with a great experience. I definitely don't want to mess with that. On the other hand, it's the product of an enthusiastic roleplayer with a great experience <i>who happens to be familiar with the concept of AP reports and regularly posts in fora online.</i> I think this might be the thing to focus on, here (or a thing, at least). See, until last year when I started checking out places like SG and the Forge and what not, I didn't know that AP was "a thing". I had read battle reports for miniature wargames, I had related stories to friends about cool events in roleplaying games, but I had never thought of going online and sharing my awesome experience with this awesome game until I found out 'oh hey, that's a part of the gamer culture online'.<br/><br/>So, my thinking is, how do you get the people who are excited about your game to be excited in public? And is there a way to do that that doesn't generate false enthusiasm or shilling or whatevs? Putting a little thing in your game that says "please go talk about your play experience at X website if you had a good time!" is something I've seen done, but seems like fairly weak sauce. It seems to me that if you have a Venn diagram where one circle is "people excited about a game" and the other circle is "people motivated to talk about games on the internet (or otherwise in public)" that there could be a way to push the first circle to overlap the second, rather than bringing the second circle over to the first one with promises of shiny gamer loot. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have no idea *how* to do that, and so I ask the floor for comments. Is paid AP a bad thing? Are there alternatives? What are some other/better ways to get your game's name out there?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290575/#Comment_290575" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T14:48:10+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  2:48PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jprussell</cite>More seriously, I feel like there has to be some way to provide an incentive to do AP reports that does not in and of itself encrappen AP reporting in general.</blockquote>\nYour feeling is wrong, see also: every form of communication since the beginning of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290584/#Comment_290584" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T15:13:18+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  3:13PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/><br/>Your feeling is wrong, see also: every form of communication since the beginning of time.</blockquote>\nNote that when I say "incentive" I don't necessarily mean "pay cash dollars" or even "provide things that have monetary value", despite the title of the thread (maybe it should have been "Compensated AP: Threat or Menace?").

Even with an incentive, most people won't do it unless they intended to anyway. How do I know? Because we offered a set of Fudge dice  for every publicly posted AP. The internet wasn't exactly swamped with them.<br/><br/>What did happen, though, is that people that normally didn't post anything anywhere ever posted some stuff about their games. Most of them were frank and critical reviews as well as play reports. Some were fan hacks and some were software. All of it was good for us and all of it was consistent with the communities in which they posted (usually the Diaspora mailing list or our forums over on RPGgeek). I'd do it again in a heartbeat -- it got people who own the game talking to each other about it.

If you get busted for that in this day and age you will reap a whirlwind of feces. Even incentivizing ANY AP might skirt that line since even with this thread we already have a few negative reactions, and some people who feel it's more or less the same thing as paying for positive reviews.

However, I'm thinking that we're looking at the incentive from the wrong direction to begin with if we think that it's the publisher who needs to incentivize AP reporting. That way lies a conflict of interests, for the value gains for the publisher and the audience are different. What I mean is simple if you stop to consider it: the publisher wants AP reports for the (ideally positive) publicity, while the audience wants AP reports for their honesty, insight, excitement and other qualities of which some (but not all) are at conflict with the publisher's wishes. I personally think that the most important quality of AP is the harsh threshold that personal excitement needs to cross before anybody cares enough to write one; this is a much more effective means of content-selection than many we see in this age of overflowing information - a game will only get AP attention if it produces experiences people want to write about. The publisher's benefit, however, is the opposite: he wants to flood the medium with AP about his own game no matter the veracity of the reporting. This difference in goals is fundamental, the best you can do is to dress it up in nice clothes in all the various ways people use in justifying advertising.<br/><br/>How do we incentivize AP without getting that conflict of interest? Seems to me that the right way is for those who benefit of true AP reports to do the incentivizing. Because the benefit we're interested in here is audience benefit, it needs to be the audience who incentivizes, not the publisher. This can be done in many ways, but one of the oldest in the book is to set up a concerned specialist who calls for and edits submissions into pleasing material for the audience; a magazine or website, in other words. This age-old structure allows you to pay the AP writer without compromising the neutrality of the AP phenomenon; you can even have the publishers of games subsidize the medium if they find the AP content valuable without compromising the integrity of the process, thanks to the firewalls afforded by the editorial process and the fact that any moneys granted to the magazine are not earmarked, but rather distributed according to the editorial policy.<br/><br/>Of course I'm not seriously suggesting a magazine here, I'm just illustrating the flaw in thinking that game publishers should be the ones incentivizing AP writing. If you truly think that there is too little AP but don't want to your subsidized AP to be branded as commercial advertising, the simplest solution to that is to not mix commercial interests with it. Promise to pay $10 for every AP for the next week no matter the game (add editorial requirements to taste) and nobody will mind; to the contrary, you'll be hailed as a valuable culture activist and patron of the art.<br/><br/>Even more seriously, you know what I think is the single greatest incentive for AP reporting? Historically the only reason AP even is a "thing" is the forum culture of the Forge, which made AP a central substance of theory and design discussion at a time when the whole idea of talking about your play was just something you occasionally and randomly did with no shared culture or purpose to it at all. Since then AP reporting has ebbed and vaned with the forum cultures of the various forums. Thus: the single best incentive for AP reporting is probably a forum culture that encourages and facilitates AP reporting of high quality. The distaste many of us have for paid AP is part of this, note: we uphold standards by being distasteful or disinterested in low-quality AP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290605/#Comment_290605" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T16:17:08+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  4:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I was just starting to stumble towards making comparisons with the review process in video games and the intense negative feeling directed at reviewers who do get paid directly by game publishers, but I think you've nailed the issue on the head.<br/><br/>In my initial response above, I was trying to get at the fact that I think one more easily workable issue in the whole AP culture is just to encourage and incentivize *doing AP* rather than *doing AP for this game right here*. You pointed out that AP as we know it today was a product of the forum culture of the forge, so I think I'd say that if we want to see more AP, we need to push the idea of sharing play experience (online, most likely) to more players who may have great gaming stories but only share them with the folks at their FLGS or the next Con or whatever. I would be inclined to say that that might be non-helpful since it's not like the internet and fora are new things, but on the other hand, as interested as I am in gaming, and as familiar with the internet as I've been for years, I still only got into the 'internet gaming forum scene/thing/habit/whatever' over the last year. <br/><br/>But this might be starting to stray into far larger 'community growth/outreach' issues than AP specifically.<br/><br/>Oh, right, also, I just wanted to say to everybody that I was definitely *not* talking about only providing incentives to vetted, positive AP reports. That seems pretty unambiguously shady to me, or at least, not very community oriented. My fear would be less of "write something nice and I give you 5 bucks" and more of "since you know I'm going to give you 5 bucks, you're going to write something nice". I think Eero gives a good suggestion for separating and negating that conflict of interest there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290606/#Comment_290606" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T16:19:03+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  4:19PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how does this tie in to sending free books to reviewers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290627/#Comment_290627" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T17:28:24+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  5:28PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for me personally, I think free review copies is no big deal, even though I, as a consumer, am going to treat a review from a "reviewer" who got the game for free differently than a spontaneous review generated by someone who got interested in it, picked it up, played it, and then decided to post his thoughts about it. Not treat it badly, just be aware that whatever thoughts and sentiments he expresses are coming from a less enthusiastic and organic framework (which has benefits and drawbacks).<br/><br/>But I think it's kind of a dick move to be like "Hey, review our game. You can find it in the store". I think it's in everybody's long term interests for any reviewers that do receive free copies of games to cultivate an independent and honest attitude towards reviewing and for publishers to take their licks with the good stuff, but that's obviously not foolproof.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290628/#Comment_290628" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T17:29:37+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  5:29PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and just to reiterate: what the hell do I know!?

Maybe it's a dick move. This is an important point to me because I am seriously tempted every time somebody asks for a review copy. It's such an obvious and widely accepted thing to do, and I don't even usually have anything against the people doing the asking, so it's not easy for me to brush off the offers without apologizing for my unreasonable attitude. We used to go to ridiculous contortions with the Finnish roleplaying magazine when they wanted review copies of our stuff - ended up trading product for product or doing personal gifts or whatnot to get over the fact that the mag had a principle of not reviewing anything they paid for and us having a principle of not giving out review copies.<br/><br/>I guess that if there were more serious journalism in the field then I'd be more comfortable with free review copies. I don't really worry about the objectiveness of mainstream art critique (for this reason at least), as I can trust that the critic is so clearly established as a professional that some comp copies are a minor matter of course for him - he gets them all the time, he gets more of them than he ever ends up reviewing, he has no reason whatsoever to let it affect him. This is not the case with roleplaying; people review as a hobby, and they certainly have much more reason to be influenced by gifts.<br/><br/>It's a grey area for me, and if it was really serious I'd probably have to rethink my attitude and wrestle more with it. Luckily I never need to worry about this for anybody else than myself, and so far I've had no trouble refusing the review offers, as the very worst I'm causing is some additional obscurity for my games and some annoyment for others with my holier-than-thou attitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290654/#Comment_290654" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T19:09:56+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  7:09PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may be drifting the thread a bit here.

These games are free, but not freely available. They may be playtests or ashcans or full-fledge games or even games that are otherwise available for a price, but free in this collection. This collection is <b>The Ziggurat</b>.<br/><br/>In order to gain access to these games one would have to join <b>The Ziggurat</b>. Once you do, you're allowed to take any three games. Pick and play with them at your leisure. But three is all you get.<br/><br/>If you want more, write an AP about one of them and post it somewhere. Tell <b>The Ziggurat</b> what you've done and <b>The Ziggurat</b> will let you grab two more games.<br/><br/>And the circle of life continues. Each time you're hungry for more games all you have to do is write up an AP for one of the games you haven't written an AP for yet and poof! Two more games.<br/><br/>There it is in a nutshell. A way to incentivize AP. A way to make free games more attractive because you have to work for them. A way to put your playtest documents in front of players looking to give feedback. And there's more fun things to be done from there. <b>The Ziggurat</b> could have a tier structure. Tier Zero games are available to anyone who joins. Tier One games can only be downloaded after your first AP, Tier Two after your second, and so forth. Exciting, big name games that you'd normally have to pay for could be waiting for you at the next tier. Who knows?<br/><br/>And if you had a large enough body of contributors, both from the design end and from the playing end, you'd produce a collection of AP that could be used for all sorts of fun things like annual awards for players and GMs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290660/#Comment_290660" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T19:30:38+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  7:30PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Even a snide whispered, "cool story, bro, thanks for posting" would incentive-ize me to do more AP.

I don't read all the AP, not even... well, /many/ of them. With limited time, I focus on Games and People I want to know more about. But even then, I read them. But I don't whisper or post a "I have read this", even when I read it and liked it, unless I had some specific questions or comments.<br/><br/>Maybe I should rethink that.<br/><br/>I saw similar behavior here in other ways: Someone posted in a thread, a really long response. It was a long thread, in which MANY people were posting. But then that person said elsewhere, "Geez, everytime I post something, there's just crickets*"... but the thing is, I read it, I saw indications that others read it. We just don't have forum-style "Attaboys" ("thumbs up", etc) for posts. I specifically did that because I didn't want to create a weird social scene where people would feel "bad" if they didn't publicly get Attaboys/Thumbs Ups/etc... but in the end, I think people on the Internet need assurance that their posts are being read.<br/><br/>I was thinking of hacking together a substitute for a "Thumbs Up", basically a "Nods Sagely" if you agree or disagree or got something interesting out of a post... but that again means that a bunch of us will have to be clicking on every fucking post with a "nod" otherwise the user feels they're not being read, etc. Blaaaaaahahahahah Web Two Point Oh can suck it.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* And usually "and I'm the designer/a man/a woman/invested in the product/a minority/the thread starter/a PhD on the subject/a professional in this area/etc". It indicates that some people need, NEED to know that eyes were on their posts: In all cases, eyes were on posts, but there weren't any "attaboys"/"good job's"/"I agrees"/whispers of agreement or nodding/etc. I feel it too sometimes ("Why isn't anyone responding to this post?" only to find out that folks are talking about it elsewhere, or that my friends in my gaming group will bring it up at our next session, etc). ! And I want to think of a way to make that happen, but without creating a bullshit "Freemarket" style social economy of Attaboys and MRCZs and Frownies, or people chasing off The Other through Creative Feedback Tricks, etc. Maybe just encourage people more to whisper attaboys to folks?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290687/#Comment_290687" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T21:09:58+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  9:09PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or I just have Facebook brain damage.<br/><br/>I really need to refrain from such posts on fora until I'm in a less needy space.<br/><br/>But I am going to think very seriously in September about providing another place for AP.

It's also a rather standard practice - "here, you might not be willing to sink in the money to buy it yourself without knowing what you'll get, I feel confident in my product so I'll send it to you for free", it happens with tech blogs, and a number of them will then use whatever they got for free as a draw and send it out to a reader. That could be something to do  with review copies - get the free copy of the book, review it, then set it up as a draw prize. <br/><br/>I think the difference with an AP report is it seems more natural, some people will review a book regardless, other people will post an AP report regardless, but if you've spent the money and put out an AP report it probably means that you liked the book well enough to play the game, and you liked the game well enough to tell people about it. It's almost as if an AP is an automatic endorsement. A review can be pretty scathing and turn people away from a product, I don't get the impression an AP does that (well, with a few exceptions).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>What if you reward AP posters not with monetary or symbolic things but more of the same (supposed) goodness they're already supporting: more game material.<br/>Let's say everyone who posts an AP gets a free pdf download of game material, like an extra class, monster or a bunch of plot hooks. Since you're not selling this material elsewhere (since the only way to get them is by posting an AP, they don't carry a pricetag, per se) you're not ''paying'' anyone for APs, just rewarding them with something that has no real world ''worth''.</blockquote>\nI was thinking of something like this, although I was thinking a free autographed copy of the book. They already paid for it, they get a second copy to keep for themselves, or they can give someone else the original and spread the love, or they've got two copies on hand for the game, which is pretty handy in terms of one for the GM and one for all the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290993/#Comment_290993" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T19:53:53+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  7:53PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe this is so obvious as to not even be worth mentioning, but it relates to my "dick move" comment about asking a reviewer to pay for a copy of the game.<br/><br/>I think there's a big ol' difference between solicited and unsolicited reviews and whether the copy should be free or not.

Providing extras for people who run games seems to me to be a form of support.</blockquote>\nCool, I agree with these! However, I'm all about honing in on edge cases in order to define a thing. So, what about if you have someone who likes your game, but didn't consider running it at a con until he got a little nudge? Obviously this is also a matter of degree, but yeah, I think Michael's distinction of 'payment' and 'support' is useful for determining what would be crass commercialism and what would be active endorsement of your creation. So, I think putting something up like "Get 20 bucks to run my game at a convention!" would be different from "If you want to run this at a convention or a local game store, let me know and I'll get you some goodies that will help!" Hell, even if the payment/support were *the exact same thing* (like a copy of the game, whether physical or electronic) the way that you presented it to your customers/audience would make a big difference, it seems. <br/><br/>I think that the vagueness in "let me know and I'll hook you up"  actually helps here, as it acts as a sort of barometer for interest. With absolutely no research to back this up, I'd imagine that lots of people would act for a guaranteed tangible thing that they want, but that only those more interested in running the game for its own sake would take an interest in finding out what the 'support' you'd offer would be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291126/#Comment_291126" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T08:49:31+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  8:49AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What is stuff though?
