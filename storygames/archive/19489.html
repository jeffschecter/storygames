Now I drafted the rules of a 2 page "white sheet edition" and would love to hear what you think about the game.<br/><br/>The original idea for the game came to me when me and my high-school friends were reminiscing about our old Warhammer and Earthdawn sessions. And how everybody remembered slightly different details about the adventures. We where talking in a pub over some beers. So an idea for a drinking game was born.<br/><br/>I am aiming for this version to be laid out on a single sheet (2 pages) for a small game you can easily print and use in a pub. Front will have majority of the rules, the back will have a "magic circle" inspired character sheet (where you write down your aspects and put down your beer) and the Moves explained.<br/><br/>As the game is now, it has a lot of unexplained quirks that come out during play (kinda took this feature from board games - you start seeing strategies and mechanics during play, instead of having them explained in the rules). The biggest one is the beer mechanic and how the gameplay will sometimes force you to use a Move in a particular way. If you have any questions about those quirks I will be happy to explain them. Once I get the white sheet edition done I will work on a pdf with examples of play, rules explanation and extra add-ons (I am toying with the idea of using an optional <a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/writers-dice.html" rel="nofollow">writer's die</a> and a alcohol free version based on pretzels...I mean tokens).<br/><br/>Mostly, I want to know if the game is understandable enough in the form as it is. I am limited for space and I want to both explain the rules and show the game's mood - is what I have good enough? How would you improve it?<br/><br/>Read on the rules below and let me know.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek" title="Level27Geek"><img alt="Level27Geek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/801/nFHCBYUL6HZMO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek">Level27Geek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433487/#Comment_433487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T22:33:38+00:00" title="June  5, 2014 10:33PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2014 10:41PM by Level27Geek.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tales &amp; Tankards<br/><br/><i>You're all sitting in a tavern. Surprisingly no Mysterious Stranger\u2122, troubled noble or wounded soldier shows up to ask for your help. There is nothing else to do, but to order some quality ale from this fine establishment and reminisce about your past adventures.</i><br/><br/><b>What is this?</b><br/>Tales and Tankards is a story driven drinking game.  Yes \u2013 a drinking game that is also a kinda-sorta RPG. No dice or GM though, just you, your friends, storytelling and beer! <br/>You and your fellow players take the roles of a veteran adventurers enjoying a bit of downtime at a local tavern. You will drink beer and tell tales of your party's glorious past exploits...or at least the version of the story YOU remember. After all, you want to make yourself sound like the greatest hero this land has ever seen, so don't be afraid to color the the story in your favor... gods know other players will do the same. <br/><br/><b>What will you need?</b><br/>Few friends<br/>A character sheet for each friend <br/>A tankard (or glass) of beer for each friend<br/>...and a pitcher of beer for the table<br/>pen or pencil will come in handy<br/>pretzels are optional (sad pretzel picture)<br/> <br/><b>Before you start.</b><br/>Each player should get themselves a beer in a see-trough glass. Someone should also get a pitcher of beer for the table. Players sit down around a table, with their beers and character sheets in front of them. Everyone should be within an arms reach of the pitcher.<br/>Discuss the setting. Don't be afraid of using a setting you are all familiar with. If you can't agree on one, just use a staple fantasy setting. You are all heroic adventurers in this world. You are now ready to...<br/><br/><b>Create the characters.</b><br/>Describe your character in few sentences to the other players. Feel free to use a character you have played in the past. Bear in mind that you are now an experienced adventurer \u2013 so don't be afraid to boast about your strengths. Other players are free to add to your description what they \u201cknow\u201d about you. While you can see yourself as a great warrior of immerse strength, others might see you as a drunk who drags around his oversized sword everywhere.<br/>Now turn this sheet around and write your name above the fancy looking magic circle. Next, inscribe one important aspect of your character in one of the circles of your newly discovered character sheet. Give your sheet to any player of your choosing. They will add a second aspect to another circle and pass it to a player of their choosing to do the same. Once each player has 3 aspects it's time to start.<br/><br/><b>Starting the tale.</b><br/>One player (the person who bought the drinks perhaps?) starts by introducing the topic of the tale. They start the narration with \u201cRemember when...?\u201d and follow it up with a feat the party has achieved in the past. Other players should respond with \u201cAye!\u201d if they want to explore this story, or stay silent if they want someone else to suggest one. If majority of players stayed silent, the person to the left of the player who just spoke introduces their tale.<br/>Once you all agreed on the tale, the person who suggested it becomes the current narrator, takes a big quaff of beer and starts telling the story \u2013 hopefully from the beginning.<br/><br/><b>Telling a Story</b><br/>Narrator continues to tell the tale of your party's adventure, setting scenes and describing events as he remembers. As soon as anyone disagrees with his version of the tale, they can <b>Add</b> to the story or <b>Challenge</b> the narrator (moves described on the character sheet).  Narrator can <b>Pass</b> the tale to any player, if he can't recall what happened next.<br/><br/><b>Heroic Beer Drinking</b><br/>Heroes NEVER pour themselves more beer from the pitcher! <br/><br/>When a move tells you to drink, you are expected to <b>at least</b> take a proper quaff, worthy of a hero! We want to hear you gulp!<br/><br/>Outside of moves, you can drink as much or as little beer at any time as you want \u2013 no gulps necessary.<br/><br/>If you ever end up with less than 2 fingers worth of beer in your glass, something bad or simply embarrassing happened to your character during the tale. Not only other players tell you what happened (and ridicule you in the process), but you can't become the narrator until you get more beer (if you are a narrator at the time, the narration rights pass to the person on your left).<br/><br/>When you drink without using a move, you can change on which aspect your beer sits. If you do, narrate how you used that aspect to add color to the tale. When a beer sits on an aspect, this aspect can't be used in any moves.<br/><br/><b>Challenge MOVE</b><br/>The narrator has it all wrong and you can't stand it! Use one of yours and one of the narrator's available aspects to explain why the narrator is wrong. You and the narrator start drinking. Each can stop at any time by putting their beer on the aspect used in the challenge. Whoever has less in his mug becomes the current narrator. If any player has less than 2 fingers of beer they automatically loose the challenge.<br/><br/><b>Add MOVE</b><br/>The narrator forgot some details, but you are here to remind him! Use one of yours or one of the narrator's available aspects to add detail to the story. The narrator will pour you some beer from the pitcher as a thank you for reminding him and use the new detail in his story. If he thinks you are wrong, he needs to drink until he has less beer than you do to prove his point.<br/><br/><b>Pass MOVE</b><br/>Only the narrator can pass. The narrator has forgotten what happens next. He passes the story rights to a player of his choosing. This player will pour some beer into narrator's mug as a thank you and will continue the story where the last narrator left off.<br/><br/>[Magic Circle goes here]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433489/#Comment_433489" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T23:30:36+00:00" title="June  5, 2014 11:30PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like drinking to move your glass around and change aspects.<br/><br/>It seems like some of the rules are unnecessarily complex. Like a stumble due to having 2 fingers or less in your glass. And then the chug-chicken of taking over as narrator if you have more than 2 fingers in your glass, but less than your opponent. I'm not against that idea, but why not have stumbles simply come from emptying your glass? If you keep the 2 fingers rule for Challenges, that actually creates an interesting situation because you can outright choose to finish your beer (faster) to win the challenge - BUT, in addition to taking over narration because the previous narrator was wrong, you have to narrate your own stumble.<br/><br/>Instead of two fingers, consider placing something in your glasses. If it breaks the surface, that creates whatever situation you want (stumble, challenge loss, etc.). If there are multiple objects of different sizes, you could add another simple layer of play that includes putting those in each others' glasses. There's a kind of playful, unsanitary intimacy in that. Plus, if each person is responsible for one item, it's fun to see what they bring.<br/><br/>Due to the basic nature of drinking games, I think I'd have to play it to really get a feel. Seems appropriately simple for when you're pretty drunk or easily hackable for when you're not.<br/>It's an immediate candidate for adding Elbows, which means that during the game, you cannot point with fingers. You must use your elbows to point. If you point with fingers, you drink. Wire in some kind of narrative hiccup that occurs when you point with fingers and you're well on your way to some comical spills.<br/><br/>Not rule-related...My first reaction, really, was that the bars I know that are welcoming and atmospheric enough to do this don't serve pitchers. And, for that matter, it's a waste to pound good beer served by those places. That's not a game criticism exactly, but, honestly, the only time events might align to make this a public game for me is Oktoberfest. Obviously, you could play this at a local dive, but would you actually want to do that? Mostly off-topic, but it just makes me wonder how narrow my own experience must be not to have a cheap-but-not-utterly-commercial bar for this kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433490/#Comment_433490" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T01:26:04+00:00" title="June  6, 2014  1:26AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>makes me wonder how narrow my own experience must be not to have a cheap-but-not-utterly-commercial bar for this kind of thing.</blockquote>Come to Vegas some time.

The few places with an atmosphere conducive to playing a game like this are brewery pubs or slightly more upscale places that specialize in serving higher end beer, not pitchers of cheap stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek" title="Level27Geek"><img alt="Level27Geek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/801/nFHCBYUL6HZMO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek">Level27Geek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433508/#Comment_433508" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T09:09:20+00:00" title="June  6, 2014  9:09AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks a lot for a great reply Paul!\n<blockquote><br/>It seems like some of the rules are unnecessarily complex [...]  2 fingers [...].<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, I think I will need to rethink the two finger rule. The way I was playing it, is that someone needed to call you on in for you to stumble. It lead to making alliances around the table (I won't call you on having less than two fingers if you will always pour me a lot of beer). It might be an idea to automatically win if you empty your glass, but you get a critical stumble. I wold love more ideas about it!\n<blockquote><br/>Instead of two fingers, consider placing something in your glasses.

You would pour some beer from your glass to the other player's glass. If you don't want to mix the beers, you can always let someone take a quaff from your beer.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433555/#Comment_433555" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-08T03:31:19+00:00" title="June  8, 2014  3:31AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2014 3:34AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As the game is now, it has a lot of unexplained quirks that come out during play (kinda took this feature from board games - you start seeing strategies and mechanics during play, instead of having them explained in the rules).

This thing above is what's going to make me do it, and I'm going to share some thoughts about it. I really like the idea that you brought a boardgame philosophy over to a roleplaying game. It's nice to see someone trying out <a href="http://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/07/13/level-5-mechanics-and-dynamics/" rel="nofollow">emergent</a> design (scroll down to the headline Emergence). I've tried something like that on my own, and the result were a D&amp;Desque game with, at least in my opinion, more tactical depth that <b>D&amp;D4</b> but from a game that only consist of two pages (and not featuring a battle grid!).<br/><br/>I like the example of the gameplay sometimes forcing a player to a move, and I played around with the thought of making a horror game do that. A game where the players are playing out a story while balancing the game mechanics at the same time. <b>Don't Rest Your Head</b> is an excellent example of mechanics that makes you strive in a certain direction, and the fight or flight mechanic in that game is worth checking out, due to it's simplicity. I think we got a lot to learn from boardgames mechanics and dynamics, especially when it comes to making the mechanics live a life on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433556/#Comment_433556" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-08T04:29:15+00:00" title="June  8, 2014  4:29AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2014 4:30AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the theme, but I wonder if it wouldn't be more powerful if people actually took real characters from previous games. You probably don't need to have this, but I wonder if the incentive to take over the narration would be stronger if there were a win condition. Are you deliberately playing around with the right to brag about the character, and creating an investment through that? That you want to defend your character and make it shine brighter than the others? If you told stories about characters that the players has played, the incentive to brag could possibly be greater.<br/><br/>I really like the mechanic that even the things out. If someone is three gulps before anyone else, that means that the challenger must drink at least four gulps. I do wonder what happens if two people have about the same amount of beer. I also wonder why someone would like to add beer before they reach the two finger mark, because that only means that they have to drink more (or others drink less, if they are "gulps" before).<br/><br/>I don't mind the two finger mark rule, and I think it sounds good as it is. I'm also seeing a bluff mechanic, where you can take one gulp and then pretend continuing drinking, even though this will probably only work once.<br/><br/>It's hard to understand some parts of the rules, but I guess that's because you will have pictures in the rules that will make the rules more clear. Some things I don't like is the "do what you like" rules, because they send a signal that the creator doesn't know how to play the game. Tell me that the buyer of the pitch gets to start the narration. Tell me that my paper is going to be passed to the left, instead of any person of my choosing. That will ease up the learning of a new game, and bring more confidence in wanting to play it.<br/><br/>In the same way, have a slight structure for how the story is being told. Right now, you pretty much ask to "narrate whatever you want". I know this is a drinking game and that the narration is not the important part, but structure brings comfort.<br/><br/>I like how you create characters together and the Add Move mechanic. I would possibly add a notion that the character should brag and in the same way describe or insinuate how bad the others are, possibly by describing how their traits are useless or turned against them, so the story will put more pressure on the others to want to take over the narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek" title="Level27Geek"><img alt="Level27Geek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/801/nFHCBYUL6HZMO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek">Level27Geek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433562/#Comment_433562" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-08T07:39:10+00:00" title="June  8, 2014  7:39AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2014 10:12AM by Level27Geek.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard - you are a gentleman and a scholar!

I didn't want to single people out so I removed this from the game. I might add a small note about it.<br/><br/>The bragging and gloating is the goal of the game. I was toying with proper winning conditions, but once you get some alcohol running trough your veins you notice that you would much rather brag than have a set winning/loosing condition. I would love to see how others feel about it, after couple beers <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Adding beer before two fingers mark? Well, once you get a bit drunk your priorities change - winning challenges is lower on the want list than getting more beer :P So why there isn't any clear strategic advantage, the human element balances it out.<br/><br/>Yeah, I should have mentioned what you should do if you have the same amount (you both drink again) - noted, and will be added in the next draft.<br/><br/>The 2 page version I am making now will benefit heavily from graphic design. There will be little icons that will give you some insight and act as a quick reminder once you get drunk <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> I am aiming for a simple, cartoony style.<br/><br/>You are right, I should add some info about the structure of the story. I can easily add structure with a little graphic on the bottom of the sheet!<br/>I will also add info that even when using the Add Move mechanic you should brag about yourself or trash the other character.<br/><br/>As for the "do what you like" rules. I see your point. What I was aiming at was a somehow laid-back feel for the game. The jury is still out if this will be changed.<br/>The "pass to whom you want" is an actual mechanic. During character generation you will listen to who trashes you least and probably give it to them, so they'll give you a hopefully good aspect. So bluffing and making alliances comes into play from the char-gen. <br/><br/>I will read trough all the comments once again and work on new draft today and tomorrow.<br/><br/>Edit: I am struggling with available space for the 2page release. Maybe it is not enough space to explain the game? How would people feel about QR codes and links in the 2page version that would take you to a more in depth explanations?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek" title="Level27Geek"><img alt="Level27Geek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/801/nFHCBYUL6HZMO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Level27Geek">Level27Geek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433609/#Comment_433609" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-09T14:33:09+00:00" title="June  9, 2014  2:33PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I updated the text a bit.

Also, try to repeat this in the text or make it stand out more. You have mechanics for drinking beer, but I'm missing the incentive of why to drink beer. Make the text a little bit more relaxed. Look at, for example, <a href="http://seadracula.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Sea Dracula</a> or <a href="http://lookrobot.co.uk/doctor-magnethands/" rel="nofollow">Dr Magnethands</a>, which are very similar in style.

Too bad the development seemed to have stalled, I would like to see it finished.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have run a playtest with the new rule of adding possible details to the story, before the proper narrative starts. It seemed to work well. Gave more structure to the narrative and made the game more fun overall. Now, I am wondering if I should add some goal to this mechanic.<br/><br/>So far the mechanic looks like this: after the topic of the tale is proposed, each player adds 3 details. Things, they think, was a prominent part of the story: "Was this the time we found those children?" "I think there were alchemist goblins in it", "yeah, I remember that, because we froze our asses of when travelling trough the tundra". Things like that. Not all of them will prove to be true, as you are missremembering things.<br/>During the game, players should use other's details. Should I add a gameplay aspect to this? Either getting more beer from the player whoe detail you used or cross of the detail of their sheet and once all their details are crossed off they get a get their glass refilled?<br/><br/>The playtest shown up another narrative aspect - playing drunk adventurers is the way to go. Roleplaying drunk people is fun at any time...doing so while drunk is even better! So you play drunk heros, talking about their adventurers a bragging about yourself - alcohol does make you more braggy after all <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> so not retired old pricks, but drunk adventurers.<br/><br/>I have started rewriting the game from a scratch, but real world has other plans for me, so the rewrite will take few more days.<br/><br/>P.S sorry for any typos. Phone typing is not fun.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433804/#Comment_433804" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-13T20:27:52+00:00" title="June 13, 2014  8:27PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true.

They start with \u201cRemember when we...\u201d and follow with some heroic feat the party has achieved in the past. Now, all the heroes should now try to remember details of this adventure. Things like \u201cIs that the one with the airship?\u201d and \u201cI remember something about goblin alchemist\u201d are good details, but try to come up with your own. Get inspired (or simply steal) details from fantasy adventures you played in the past. You know, the ones with dungeons, dragons, tombs of horrors etc.<br/>Create interesting locales, NPCs or obstacles you want to see in the story, but keep them vague enough so others can use them. Each player should come up with 3 details and write them down on their character sheet. Once this is done, the starting player says: \u201cSo, we were sitting in a tavern, when...\u201d and starts narrating the adventure hook.<br/><br/>First playtest, people only looked around the table and incorporated a detail in their narration. It took some power away from the <b>ADD </b>move, as people concentrated on on the details on the table (Is that a bad thing?). In the second playtest, people seemed lost and told me they needed more structure. <br/><br/>Any ideas how to handle this guys?<br/><br/>I am toying with the idea of using post-its (or scraps of paper like in doctor magnethands) to write those details, and maybe use them as cards? Something similar to <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18723/aye-dark-overlord" rel="nofollow">Aye, Dark Overlord</a>. Or maybe I should create <b>Adventure Modules</b> akin to fiasco playsets? Both require the players have more stuff prepared (bring post-its or module). This takes away from the chance for spontaneous play. But now that I am thinking about it more and more, I don't think spontaneous play is something people will do that much :P<br/><br/>On the other hand, the re-write is going forward, but is severely slowed down by my job.

Maybe provocative questions to guide them (where, why, who's chasing you...) Ask each player one question. It's easier to invent <i>"Hey, remember that time at the marketplace in Iscandria"</i> rather than an entire story. Once someone has started (or picked from a list) the others can associate.<br/><br/>Or some generative heuristic, with moves that confuse <i>"No, you're got it wrong again, that was Numijkad, the story in Iscandria was the one with the Sultan!"</i> or elaborate <i>"That fat sultan with his enchanted carpet collection?"</i>...<br/><br/>I think random association works well to kindle the imagination. By focussing on just one tangible aspect or question, you can let the players start thinking. Give them something first, rather than "now figure out everything!" Inventing entire stories, even shaky ones, isn't easy!  <br/>Also, by sharing the brainstorm (or even deliberately create confusion) you make it easier to associate.<br/><br/>Another suggestion is to remove the <i>Pass </i>move (and fixed turns, if you have that). And change the <i> Add </i>or <i>Challenge</i> into someting more tangible, perhaps formulaic, like the <i>"remember when we..."</i> <br/><br/><i>"You were totally ... then, this is what really happened..."</i> instead of Challenge.<br/><br/>Great game btw, I'm following this up!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434173/#Comment_434173" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T10:10:12+00:00" title="June 22, 2014 10:10AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to take a look at The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen, and the lists of "adventures" therein, something there might inspire you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
