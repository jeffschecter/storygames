And some mechanic to keep action from stalling. And some kind of currency that allows the group/system to reward players for getting their character motivations in the story. And some way to compel actions from players, that could actually make the game more interesting for them instead dissapointing. So conflict resolution can't end in a "no you can't" way but instead in a "you don't make it, but now X happens"<br/><br/>So far I've just hacked several GMless games and a ton of mechanics from different indy games (that's why probably most of the above sound familiar to you), then I came up with a narrative card game that works ok but isn't yet what I'm looking for.<br/><br/>If you want to check it here it is: <br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18iXnAIDMtaPpZX375EJbDcGvtxJ29Rh4l7BlFd-6FwU/edit?authkey=CJ6IgOoI&amp;hl=en_US#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/18iXnAIDMtaPpZX375EJbDcGvtxJ29Rh4l7BlFd-6FwU/edit?authkey=CJ6IgOoI&amp;hl=en_US#</a><br/>It's basically a hack of the whimsy cards with a mechanic to have each player frame scenes with challenges to the other players, using the  words that come up on the cards in any way to phrase the situation. That handles plot twists wonderfully. An initial list of elements helps keep story from derrailing, however each game can't go further from 2 and a half hours of gameplay.<br/><br/>Anyway, I suspect it's not impossible given some concessions and ditching some on these goals, however I still havent found a proper method to get there. I started working with random tables, which ca be good for prep but tend to halt the game if used in mid session or even for scene framing. Cards work better. Just put a word or two on each and it gives players a clue to start from. However you would have to make a different deck for each mechanic (scene framing, plot twist, NPC reactions, etc) and find a way to have the player draw them in a way that makes sense and not spoil the whole next scene for anybody on the table.<br/><br/>So I'm back to where I started and making more research (lurking and reading other games) wondering if this is actually possible at all. If you find this all looks like an existing game, please tell me and put an end to my misery.

Here's how I'm handling it:<br/><br/>You and your partner draw cards to create the initial scenario, then identify the challenges to the heroes implied by the random cards you drew -- a lot like identifying the characters in <i>In a Wicked Age</i>. You rate how big a deal each challenge is, and at the beginning of each scene, decide which challenges you're going to resolve.<br/><br/>The core scene resolution mechanics involve converting mechanical adversity to narrative adversity -- your buddy wants you to describe bad stuff happening to him, so that he doesn't take as much abstract damage. Meanwhile, describing actions for your own hero gives you the dice pool you need to move the scene closer to resolution.<br/><br/>So that's how I'm handling it. It works pretty well for getting players going, keeping them on-theme, and keeping them talking. It doesn't particularly help with players who don't like improvisational narrative, nor does it allow for players to avoid collaboration.<br/><br/>As for players with poor narrative abilities, one solution is to provide more prompts, and theme those prompts to the implied setting. I'd consider making a lot of mini-tables for different kinds of action, and structure them like <i>Apocalypse World</i> moves. For example:<br/><br/><b>Traveling Over Land</b><br/><br/>If you fail, pick one of the following.\n<ul>\n<li>Ambushed</li>\n<li>Lost in a bad place</li>\n<li>Arrive during trouble</li>\n</ul>\nIf you roll a single success, pick one of the following. If you roll multiple successes, pick two.\n<ul>\n<li>Meet an unexpected ally</li>\n<li>Arrive ahead of trouble</li>\n<li>Be welcomed warmly</li>\n<li>Arrive without being noticed</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Carousing</b><br/><br/>If you fail, pick one of the following.\n<ul>\n<li>Insensibly drunk</li>\n<li>Spurning you, a potential partner becomes an enemy</li>\n<li>Robbed of your money or another precious resource</li>\n</ul>\nIf you roll a single success, pick one of the following. If you roll multiple successes, pick two.\n<ul><li>An attractive stranger offers aid</li>\n<li>Win money or another precious resource</li>\n<li>Gain valuable information</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334320/#Comment_334320" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T14:18:06+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  2:18PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/warriormonk">@warriormonk</a> <br/><br/>I am also working towards something very very similar.  I started out with In a Wicked Age, giving scene framing capabilities to each player. Each scene drives the character a little bit closer to his best interests. The abstract conflict mechanics handle the narrative negotiation quite well.<br/><br/>The main problems I am having are related to scene framing and pacing conflicts.<br/><br/>Scene framing becomes the central mechanic, much more important than abstract character power, and it is not clear how to make it robust in the face of aggressive playing. Right now I am experimenting on putting character on a track that I call screentime.. the more advantageous a scene has been to a character, the more screentime the character acquires. The character with lower screentime can always go first.<br/><br/>The rules to interrupt scenes, escape scenes, stop scenes from happening and create obstacles have not been formally defined.  I am exploring these 3 alternatives:<br/>- polaris style negotiation<br/>- dice pools / tokens universails style<br/>- bonus cards.. whenever a player does something outside the norm, he writes up a card that allows the other players to do the same effect later on in the game (or to negotiate a lesser effect).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334321/#Comment_334321" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T14:19:35+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  2:19PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            and I would like to add... the plot almost takes care of itself.

I agree there must be some sort of collaboration among the players, It's just that I'm used to have players that like to test the system and always try the weirdest input, trying to see if it breakes. It's just the way they have their fun: they want something else to happen. If I find a way to make the system answer weird input from the players with even stranger plot twists, or just with something other that the game stalling, I'll have the game I need.<br/><br/>Most of the time, once players find that the system actually gives them a reasonable answer, they start so collaborate. Otherwise, they just keep picking on the GM and other players until the situation changes completely.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Emprint">@Emprint</a>, cards look good, though I would like to see if there's another way to frame scenes, since you would either need a lot of cards or different expansions of the game to play another kinds of settings or genres. Perhaps cards could indicate a generic kind of situation and the rest of the details are left for the players to come up with ideas. I find making a short list of words at the begginning of the game helps a lot to define the limits of the story. I use a list of 1 known menace in the setting per player (most of times 3 is more than enough) and 1 hope per player. This way even the setting can be created in minutes before the game and all player get familiar with it since they are involved in the setting creation. The "pick choice from the list" looks useful, though you will have to prevent a lot of different situations and make a list for each kind. And it will have to be done in a "quick reference" way for players to use it.<br/><br/>GTG, but tomorrow I'll post some ideas about scene framing and conflict resolution. Definetly there must be some sort of in-game currency that allows players to affect narrative in certain ways, but with a limited effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emprint" title="Emprint"><img alt="Emprint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emprint">Emprint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334523/#Comment_334523" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T15:12:04+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  3:12PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now, I'm using cards on a lookup table, just like IAWA. Being able to swap out the cards/tables to change the setting is one of the advantages of the card mechanic. I've got a number of ideas for alternate tables, though the current focus is somewhere between Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser and the Dying Earth. I'm also looking at play formats that use stacked decks, along the lines of <i>Castle Ravenloft</i>.<br/><br/>The pick from list mechanics would have to be pretty extensive, yeah, but you could pack in a lot of subtle story influence in them. It'd also be something you could combine with a mapped setting like <i>The Wilderlands of High Fantasy</i>, which appeals to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334526/#Comment_334526" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T16:15:09+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  4:15PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Ivan">@Ivan</a> you're right, players must have scene framing capabilities, that would keep the game looking fresh every time it's played. I'm going for splitting scene framing responsabilities among the players, thus you would have one player stating the location/weather, npcs present, monsters, magic/tech and then some mechanic to decide which one gets to state the challenge in this scene. It could be in turns or obeying some sort of narrative scheme, but the point is that nothing is created until the PCs interact with it.<br/><br/>Let's say the challenge inthis scene is the location: that would mean it's risky to go through it, so it can be a chasm, a mountain, a lava pit, etc. It could also mean the weather presents a challenge: rain, extreme heat, mist, anything can turn the path into a deadly trap. But it's up to the player that frames the location of the scene to come up with the situation.<br/><br/>Now, the challenge can be an NPC. We could define a limited number of personalities and professions, states and emotions. Then the player framing NPCs in the scene could choose randomly from the list and add a quirk. Perhaps the state and emotion can turn the NPC in a challenge to the players per se, but most probably it would be up to the players to throw something else into it: somebody could have a relation to that character or come up with something that relates that character to the plot.<br/><br/>Also <a href="/forums/profile/Ivan">@Ivan</a>, about the plot and screen time,  If each player gets to play their character in turns, nobody should have less screentime than the others, however players creative input can help make the story better, so perhaps the reward for that input should be giving their characters the spotlight and make them move foward their goal. I'm just saying this because I'm not sure if giving them screentime would be equal to give them gametime, leaving the rest of the players with nothing to do but frame the scene for the "main characters"<br/><br/>Perhaps attaining the "main character" tag could be a short term goal that could make the game a bit more competitive, at least in the beggining. Of course, the rest of the players can have their fun making bigger and bigger challenges to the main characters through scene framing. Perhaps that could be enfatized in the ruleset.<br/><br/>Let's go a bit further: players get to frame the scenes, in the first scene one of them gets to introduce a challenge in the scene. In the second scene, two players get to introduce two challenges in the scene, and so on. Thus conflict could go up in crescendo. Risk should also increase as the game progresses. Perhaps players can gamble an aspect or relationship in order to overcome conflicts, <i>a la</i> Gray Ranks instead of their health. I won't mean that the aspect/relationship would dissapear if they lose, but that it  will change if they do.<br/><br/>About conflict resolution and character abstract power, I came up with a mechanic that eliminates almost all of the crunch of the characters, turning them into descrptors of the tools and skills the character uses to solve their problems. I know that now this would make the game not everybody's cup of tea, but I certainly prefer that to having munchkinized characters monopolizing the spotlight. (except perhaps if the players behind those characters could actually make the plot interestinf for all the group.<br/><br/>The mechanic is this: PCs only numeric stat is LEVEL. A challenge two levels above PC level is impossible to face and thus PCs have to run from it. A challenge two levels below PC level isn't a challenge at all and so players narrate their victory as they like. Dice roll isn't affected either by strategic choices, character stats or equipment. Players just roll two different colored d6; one represents positive outcome and one negative outcome. The higher indicates... well, the outcome of the conflict. Tied rolls represent negative outcome, except for the double six. You can also rule that whenever a player rolls a negative outcome, he has to add a complication to the challenge. When a double 1 is rolled, then the challenge goes up one level, and on a double 6, the challenge goes down one level.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Emprint">@Emprint</a>, that looks good, I should take a look already at IAWA. I think a mix of cards for plot twists and list for the setting could do. The extension of the list would depend on how detailed the players want the setting to be/how much their characters know from the start of the story. Perhaps the list could get bigger in game and to start the game quickly perhaps the elements the players are gonna use in their campaign would be enough.<br/><br/>Definitely, I want to go for a "things are created when PCs interact with them" design in this game, but the system to create stuff really needs to be quick and intuitive, or else it won't work...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334573/#Comment_334573" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T22:11:29+00:00" title="July 14, 2011 10:11PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk\u2014Have you played Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries?

Having PCs against each other or taking sides is also a great way to make an interesting story, but I would like to see if there's a way for making a GMless game where players group to reach the same goal, and also where players make conflicts interesting not only in the scene framing stage but in the way NPCs and monster react.<br/><br/>Right now I'm going for "each time you roll against a challenge and the outcome is negative, the challenge complicates and you get to narrate how" This way, lets say a pyromancer casts a fireball against a dragon. If he rolls lower than the dragon, then it means the dragon has a resistance to fire, that there's an antimagic field blocking his spells, or plainly that the dragon is faster and hit first. <br/><br/>However none of this statements has to be irrevocable. For example, let's say we choosed to go for the anti-magic field. This time the necromancer tries an spell; if he rolls higher than the dragon, it means that either the field was weakened on the previous attack or that it doesn't works against necromancy.<br/><br/>Now, if the PCs are either a group or a couple of groups against each other, separate actions of group members are equal to separate rolls, but if the whole group channels their effort in a single coordinated action, that's a single roll. We can also use a rule here that for each helping character the group gets a re-roll, but they don't get to keep the best result, only the last roll they made. <br/><br/>I'm still thinking hard about this, any ideas?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
