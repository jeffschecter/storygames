                    I do a lot of Fantasy gaming.  (Let me introduce my particular guilty pleasure to start; have I mentioned exhibitionism, too?  No, wait, this isn't THAT kind of meeting.)  One of the things I'd like to learn is maybe under the category of pacing, and in this case, a particular kind of pacing:<br/><br/>I want to establish "ordinary" before introducing "extraordinary." <br/><br/>This seems to work best in Urban Fantasy settings because, face it, most of us are familiar with urban environments. My players have less of a learning curve that way than if I'm introducing them to life as single celled organisms on the planet Venus.  (Well, I'm not sure about EVERYONE in my gaming group, but let's presume...)  The tropes of revised-medieval fantasy are also fairly quick pick-ups, but those aren't the only places I want to play.<br/><br/>While it seems fairly obvious that it's idiosyncratic, how do you tell when your players are ready to hit the "Whee!" button and jump down the rabbit hole?  Are there signs?  Do you go down (the rabbit hole) on the first date--I mean, session?<br/><br/>(And if I've totally misplaced this post, let me know: I would normally have entered it over on <a href="http://www.skyseastone.net/masters/" rel="nofollow">the Masters' Council</a> but I wanted a different viewpoint as brought from a different group.)                </div>

                            Urgh.  I had a coherent thought, but then I wanted to bring in too many ideas.  I often have this problem.<br/><br/>Let me see if I can break it down into smaller bites and make better questions of them.  (And in the meantime, I've learned to juggle!  Wait, no.  Nevermind.)<br/><br/>I'm such a novice to this kind of thinking.  I think I signed up for these forums just to challenge myself to learn the techniques. It used to be, you sat down with a bunch of people and you gamed, none of this "We call this immersion," and "the destabilities of the strength of the bioneural phase varience of the randomization circuitry mean that we can't possibly use dice for this option."<br/><br/>OK.  'Nuff complaining, and back to the point.<br/><br/>Smaller bites.<br/><br/>1) What is the point called when players make the change between, "Well, it's odd, but I guess the King might do that," and "No, we know the King, there's no way he'd do that!"?<br/><br/>2) How do you [<i>slowly</i>] (the pacing portion of the question) add the unusual to what the players know? <br/><br/>2a) Without them accepting it as "usual"?                        </div>

                            MtFierce (whose real name I always forget), I would advise you to watch some movies and television serials and try and pick apart their pacing.  Game pacing is not the same, but you can take some valuable lessons from other genres.<br/><br/>I'd like to suggest that what you are going after is a good thing, but you're going at it in a poorly-considered way.  As you will see in those films and teevee shows, it isn't a matter of delaying the strangeness till later.  It's a matter of introducing the normal and then subverting it in a one-two combo, and usually in the same scene.<br/><br/>Good god, is Buffy a good example of this.  Example: scene starts in a normal, daylight, city street.  Buffy is shopping.  Totally effing normal, right?  She gets her hair done.  Then she gets shot with an invisibility ray.  Yoink, right out of 'normal' and into 'the interesting stuff that we play the game for'.  But the interesting stuff is only interesting because it's juxtaposed right next to the normal (and to a lesser extent, the normal is only normal when compared to the extraordinary).<br/><br/>For the King -- lookit Lord of the Rings.  The Fellowship (or what's left of it) comes into Rohan with Gandalf running at the mouth about the Good King that rules there and how he's hale and hearty and badass -- and then they show up in the throne room and he's all decrepit and Wormtail is whispering in his ear like a cringing little cringing thing.  See?  One-two, bang-bang.<br/><br/>You can set things up way beforehand and then exploit them, but the longer you take, the less power the set up has.  To optimize it, you do setup and then go right into the inversion.<br/><br/>But, admittedly, that's me and I'm a way demanding narrative structure freak, so.  Your mileage and all that.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  OK, there is two ways to interpret this. One, pacing inside a system. Yes, you need to establish what is normal in order to have the abnormal stand out more. And you have to take into consideration previously established boundaries before you can push them. The best advice is don't do one or the other, mix it up. Don't always subtley push the boundaries and abnormalities, ocassionally do it it jumps and starts to keep it inetersting.<br/>
<br/>
  However, if you are talking about ramping the group up to be more accepting of another system, don't do it. You essentially will have one of two generic group types:<br/>
1) Gamers. These guys will like the game you are playing and the only other games they will consider when you start a new campaign will be similar systems. You can try a system that is radically different from what you are playing now, and it might stick. But it might just be a pleasant diversion til they get back to the REAL games<br/>
2) Players. These guys like to try new things, monkey around with different kinds of systems and generally are always up for a larf. It may be difficult to get them to finish what they started, but you will always be able to try new stuff.<br/>
<br/>
  One is not better than the other. but don't make the mistake of trying to force one to act like the other. Ultimately, when people get bored or just want to try something new, suggest a new system, if that is what you are getting after.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope I provided coherent and useful info man!<br/>

Would you play through the shopping and getting the hair done?  That's part of my question.

I've been reading <a href="http://darkush.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Steven Barnes</a>' blog where he's talked a lot about working that into writing.

Subtlety is a tool that isn't always appropriate in every situation; I think I see that now.  (Especially in something like a convention one-shot, which is most of what I design these days.)

<code>Would you play through the shopping and getting the hair done? That's part of my question.</code><br/><br/>Yes -- although what exactly constitutes "play through" is going to depend on context.<br/><br/>In an online MUSH game, "play through" may mean spending a full hour getting coffee and chatting before the vampire comes through the skylight and "the action" starts.<br/><br/>In FLFS, "play through" means the players make a couple die checks to charge their thematic batteries up, and maybe pass a scrip or two -- which is, like, twenty to thirty minutes.<br/><br/>In Feng Shui, "play through" might mean the GM saying "Okay, you're out shopping... then you get shot with an invisibility ray."<br/><br/>See what I mean?                        </div>

Thank you! I am pretty sure I see what you mean, although the examples do suggest that that genre question still comes into play.  [ponders, bites lip]  I'll keep thinking.  And working, of course.  <i>Always working</i>.                        </div>
