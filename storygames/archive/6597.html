It's <a href="http://dikaiosunh.livejournal.com/257632.html" rel="nofollow">on his LJ</a> so you can give him kudos there, but I'm also going to paste it on in here for this post so we can all give him  love for his awesomeness. I really wanna give this a try. Here's the hack, in David's own words:<br/><br/>Despite the hating it gets in the indie-game community, Vampire was a revelation for me - like many folks, I was used to D&amp;D, and it was a WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD. I played Vampire almost exclusively for most of university, and had a blast, and played some of my favorite characters, bar none. But the system was always, "enh."<br/><br/>In later times, I've tried (and failed) to get back into Vampire a few times, and had some good false starts. But now that I've been exposed more to indie games, I've been thinking some more about what the game is supposed to be about, and realized that there was no one thing that it was about. I'm not sure yet if that's what made it cool, or if that's what made it never able to quite fulfill its promise.<br/><br/>But it occurred to me that MY might make a good system for a particular sort of Vampire game, one focused on the archetype of neonates fighting the power and trying to maintain some semblance of Humanity. So, not my dream Sabbat game yet, but...<br/><br/>Mistreatment becomes Embrace.<br/><br/>Vampires embraced because of love were chosen by an immortal who could not bear to lose the relationship with them, and they gain strength through their ardor for another. The inhuman form of love is lust, the endless, soulless quest for physical fulfilment.<br/><br/>Those embraced for dynasty have the destiny of perpetuating some great line - a powerful vampiric clan, a lineage of human warriors, or a society of sublime scholars. Those who deny their family become inhuman servants of sycophancy and slavishly promote the good of some parochial group.<br/><br/>The embrace of power is given to those who have some mortal gift a vampire wants to preserve - political influence, knowledge, or wealth. Inhuman vampires twist power into dominance.<br/><br/>Some vampires are embraced for mere thrill, by a hedonistic sire. They tend to share these bon vivant ways unless they become inhuman mockeries driven by sadism, the pain of others, rather than their own pleasure.<br/><br/>Finally, some vampires are created through dark ritual. They tend to focus on the mystical, or even religious aspects of the vampiric condition. Those who give in to inhumanity walk the path of blasphemy.<br/><br/>Motivation becomes Ideal, and describes the goal that keeps a character focused on her humanity.<br/><br/>Art (pretty self explanatory) becomes Exhibitionism.<br/><br/>Liberation might be the Brujah's drive to freedom, or the Tzimisce's desire to transcend the flesh. Inhuman vampires instead seek Anarchy, literal or figurative - this describes a life of mad experimentation as well as smashing the state.<br/><br/>Harmony is a drive to find one's place in the natural order, but slides easily into Bestiality.<br/><br/>Understanding is a common goal, though it may instead be a mask for the inhuman madness.<br/><br/>Order is the goal of many an altruistic vampire, and they may not realize when they cross over to pursue the inhuman Stasis.<br/><br/>Means remains, as do Tough/Brutal, Smart/Pedantic, and Cool/Trendy. To these add:<br/><br/>Political becomes manipulative.<br/><br/>Spiritual becomes necromantic.<br/><br/>Replace Shtick with Gift. This is a description of the vampire's supernatural power, which is unique to each, and becomes darker in tone as the vampire becomes more inhuman. So, "form of the wolf" might become "devourer of children."<br/><br/>Replace Glitch with Hunger. This describes the particular sort of human from which the vampire feeds, as well as gives a hint to the sort of actions that hunger might drive her to. When a vampire sells the last of her Humanity, hunger transforms into a drive unutterably foul, and all hope is lost.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146420/#Comment_146420" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T10:42:58+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 10:42AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Authority is, of course, The Beast.<br/><br/>Visage<br/><br/>Methuselah - the Authority is a single, ancient, and ultra-powerful vampire.<br/><br/>Prince - the Authority is the Prince of the city, who in this case is both a "legitimate" ruler and the source of great inhumanity.<br/><br/>Cabal - the true power in the city is a secret cabal of powerful vampires, operating behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Sabbat - the Sabbat threaten the city, both with destruction and temptation to chaos.<br/><br/>Others - vampires are threatened by an outside force, such as lupines, magi, or even mortal vampire hunters<br/><br/>Vice can probably remain almost the same, actually. I think even the splats work. Utopian lupines who actually drive the vampires to greater inhumanity in self-defence? A fearful methuselah who will destroy everything to prevent his return to futile slumber?<br/><br/>Victim is the one I'm least confident of, but here's a go:<br/><br/>The Masquerade - the Beast will destroy the veil of illusion that lies between vampire and human, forcing vampires to openly and inhumanly rule the kine if they want to survive.<br/><br/>Kine - the Beast threatens normal mortals with destruction or enslavement.<br/><br/>Souls - the Beast has desires that require the twisting and damnation of vampires' souls and moral character.<br/><br/>Gaia - the Beast seeks to blast the Earth and make it a more agreeable Hell.<br/><br/>Society - the Beast will destroy or twist the social order, Kindred and Kine alike, such as through mass enslavement or anarchy, destroying the humanizing bonds between individuals.<br/><br/>Of course, the ancillae and elders are all too caught up in their own lives and power struggles to realize the true threat, and only young punk neonates can see it, and avert it. But will they take their place among the inhuman, ossified elders to do it? Or will they maintain some of their humanity despite their Hunger? Of course, given an eternity, everyone eventually succumbs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146460/#Comment_146460" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T11:53:30+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 11:53AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>So, not my dream Sabbat game yet, but...</blockquote>\nHe has a dream Sabbat game?
