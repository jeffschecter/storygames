I have a game on my back burner that may fill this demand. <br/><br/>The game is <i>Survivors: Existential Roleplaying in the Nuclear Wasteland.</i>  I mostly based it in Sartre, but I could probably dust of my Bro's K from college.<br/><br/>First: is there a true demand for this kind of game?<br/><br/>Second:  The whole of this thing, even with a brief overview of Existentialism and Nuclear Wastelands, will come to about 10-12 pages.  If I commissioned some art, I could get it to about 12-15.  Distribution options for such a small book?  Is printing feasable?

Characters try to define their lives and the lives of the other players while trying to survive in a hopeless environment.  My poject is this: what would an Existentiallist RPG play like?  I had originally modled it after JP Sartre's <i>No Exit</i> and <i>The Stranger</i>, which I find to be very accessable from a gaming point of view.<br/><br/>What is Survivors about?  Defining yourself in the context of others.  Existential philosophy.<br/>What do the characters do?  Try to survive in a nuclear wasteland while attempting to realize themselves.  In order to be "myself," others have to play along-- I cannot lead if nobody follows.  So, I must coerce by various means their cooperation in my identity.<br/>What do the players do?  Define the scenes and situations, overcome survival challenges, and inflict traits on other players. <br/><br/>Why GM-less?  One of the core tennets of Existentiallist thought is that there is no meaning to anything except what we give it.  Having a GM means there will invariably be plot, structure and all the things that come with that.  By removing the GM, I hope to make an uncaring and random world, one without meaning, and no plot other than what the players put into it.<br/><br/>Why a nuclear wasteland?  All of those things that go with the world, the "I am THIS" has just gotten blown to hell.   The only thing left in a hostile world is the interaction between these characters and the identities they give to themselves.<br/><br/>What is the system like?  The system itself is undergoing a bit of revision, but the core of it is The Tree and the Trait Track.<br/>The Tree is filled out at the beginning of the game, and it has three parts.  The Trunk is a one word or phrase definition of who you want to be: Mother, Tyrant, Leader, Rebel, whatever.  The Roots are four traits that you must gain to become The Trunk (eg, a Mother could choose Nurturing, Protective, Caring and Wise.)  There is one Branch for each other player, and each has 4 traits that they need to gain for you to become your Trunk.  So, our Mother example may need a Daughter, a Husband, and a Threat-- each with four traits.<br/>The Trait Track is a list of the traits that the character has accumliated, which defines their Angst.  Angst makes getting new traits more difficult, and makes survival chacks harder.<br/><br/>It's been on the back burner for about six months now, so I've got a bit of revision before it's in playtest shape, but I should be able to get a preliminary document up and running before too long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
