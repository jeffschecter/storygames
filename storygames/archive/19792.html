It's a resource to make it less dangerous to play with strangers, but not a panacea. I'm playing a certain game with someone I'm intimate with, we already know each other's boundaries quite well, and though the rules of the game mandate we have X-cards in front of us, we never get to use them - we're never going.<br/><br/>The X-card is analogous to <b>safe words</b> in Nordic larping (I can look up links if you're interested): an emergency brake for when shit has already happened, but it's not yet so bad that we can't manage to pull a brake anymore. This accounts for such a narrow range of uses that the conventional wisdom, since years, has been that <i>safe words don't work</i>. Still, no larpwright in their right mind would do away with them: rather, those are considered to be a baseline and starting point from which to improve, experiment with additional techniques for "player safety" and "de-fucking". Most such techniques that I know of involve "buddies" and are specific to the reality of larping, where the main issue is: you can't usually stop the whole game to deal with one player's problems. Stopping and resuming the game is a non-issue in tabletop rpgs, fortunately.<br/><br/>I wouldn't think of any of the above as techniques for <i>setting</i> boundaries, because establishing a road map through repeated use of an emergency brake doesn't sound like the best idea. The role of the X-card, to me, is more about <i>affirming that we care</i>, as a group, and this goes a long way about establishing an emotionally safer environment.<br/><br/>Slightly more useful for setting boundaries are the now classic concepts of "lines and veils", as long as they're known and used proactively. When the fiction is going someway that you expect something you're uncomfortable with to be a plausible outcome of, declare you're drawing a line. Do it before you're actually there. Call for veils liberally when the fictional facts concern something you don't want to hear the minute details of, and do it before some other players starts reveling into it.<br/>Of course, this is attention consuming, and therefore best reserved for things you really have some issue with, 'cause you're on edge about those no matter what.<br/><br/>For fine-tuning preferences, I like a technique such as the "Try a different way" ritual phrase in Archipelago.<br/><br/>In the end, though, I believe you can only reliably "set boundaries" the long, hard way: by getting to know your co-players over time, both through playing together and other social occasions, personal conversations, developing relationships and an actual friendship. If you're playing with real, intimate friends you can (as a side-benefit of you relationship) play with your boundaries and push them, knowing exactly where to stop. When you're playing with strangers, well, that's also fun and an opportunity to get to know each other, but basically you have to behave yourself and play safe, to estimate your and others' boundaries <i>very</i> conservatively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439021/#Comment_439021" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T03:30:53+00:00" title="October  5, 2014  3:30AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to play in some Nordic larps a decade or so ago (and, since, I've worked on the prep for some, but not participated) but recently there's been an influx of extreme themes in the local tabletop scene.

It's not up to others to monitor/censor themselves for the benefit of the person being offended. It's up to each individual to realize that no one else is beholden to them, and to choose for themselves rather they'll risk offense/discomfort by engaging in activities with others. When they become offended they can choose to move on, or to challenge themselves with the exposure (which doesn't mean 'taking it' silently btw...it can mean engaging in communication or a number of other options). If someone is truly 'over the line' regularly they will quickly find themselves playing alone, or with others just like they are, so the problem resolves itself.<br/><br/>There simply is no 'right' to not be offended - in rpgs or even life itself actually. Of course, 99% of the time I play with people I already know well, so that definitely figures in as well.<br/><br/>With that being said I think JDCorley is pretty spot on with content discussions. These can be table level or included within the game rules. I also think that post-game feedback is critical with such things. Many will go in thinking "this won't bother me" and then later realize "wow, that actually made me a bit uncomfortable."                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439033/#Comment_439033" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T12:15:23+00:00" title="October  5, 2014 12:15PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2014 12:17PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whilst I sympathize with that, I think there's a gradient where "being offended" is on one end and "I physically can't handle this content" is on the other. I agree that yes, people should be less offended by small things, <i>but</i> sometimes it's not just offense that's in the picture. Sometimes there's content that is really, truly causing a problem for people. And there should definitely be ways to manage that.<br/><br/>It's sorta like the difference between disliking peanut butter and having a peanut allergy. You can't reasonably tell both people "look, just deal with it". That doesn't help the person with the allergy.<br/><br/>EDIT: That is to say, I don't think we should presume that when someone's unwilling to engage in content, it's just because they find it mildly offending. It's very possible that they find it grossly offensive or difficult to deal with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/williamj35" title="williamj35"><img alt="williamj35" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/williamj35">williamj35</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439034/#Comment_439034" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T13:41:02+00:00" title="October  5, 2014  1:41PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Safe-Hearts.pdf" rel="nofollow">Safe Hearts</a> might be a resource (disclosure: I haven't read it yet but it looks good).<br/><br/>I also like how Microscope handles set up: with a list of things that WILL happen in the game and a list of things that WON'T. Every player gets to add one thing either to the "Yes" column or the "No" column of the "palette" in turn order. Players keep taking rounds of adding items to the palette. If a player passes, then that round is the last before play starts.<br/><br/>I don't know that this would be a perfect solution, but it would at least allow players to ban their biggest triggers. If some jerk adds "rape" to the Yes column, then this gives other players an opportunity to back out of the game or to ask the guy to revise his addition. At the very least, this gives everyone clear guidelines and a heads up about what should and shouldn't happen during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439036/#Comment_439036" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T13:54:04+00:00" title="October  5, 2014  1:54PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2014 1:54PM by phoenix182.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            nvm, don't want to derail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439037/#Comment_439037" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T14:05:45+00:00" title="October  5, 2014  2:05PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not like all I'll do is sit at home and try to protect myself for the rest of my life.

The phase where we're supposed to face these fears, engage with this sort of content, that's still a few years in the future, if we get there.<br/><br/>And, ok, <b>trigger warning</b> for a game with a horrific name.<br/><br/>And yes, I know I have the choice to leave the group. Which is what I've done three times this year, with all different people. To me, having three groups <small>(out of five -- of the remaining two, I started one myself and the other is currently running the same module I am. I'll rejoin when they start Tyranny)</small> want to play games where rape is an important theme seems ridiculous to me. Like, either I have the worst luck, or times are just sour.<br/>In all of them, I didn't know them that well and I am the only woman. They were all super kind to me but it's hard for me to know how to block or move away from the topic.<br/>The first group, we were playing a local PtbA horror game. The GM was great, but one other player was really into these themes. Our discussion of lines and veils almost led to inspiration for this player rather than moving away from it. The other group, I'm not sure I'm done forever with (I had a great time playing ASE with them), but they're on a Raggi kick with rotating DMs. I can't deal with DLD and Carcosa (without dissing those who can).<br/>The third group. All story games, almost all one- or few-shot games rather than campaigns. We had a fun night playing a oneshot of a GM-less game none of us thought was that good. Great time, liked the other players' styles. Afterwards, they tell me that they're big kick is difficult choices, suffering, human themes. Narrativism basics. Cool, I say. I'm more into like wishforfilment, being a hero etc.<br/>I make a post on a local forum about some theory on interesting choices - game design classic stuff. They mention the game "Gang Rape" as a game they wouldn't play. I can't deal. "X card", I say, and close the tab, having trouble coping. It's weird, it was an out-of-game mention. But I wanted out. Anyway, I get notified that the thread has been updated and the PDF had been posted in the thread and they now say "actually, we've been planning to run it for quite a while, but attendance is completely optional!". I flip. More for the "push over the border of the X-card" -- realizing it can't protect me -- than for the game itself, but both. Absolutely both. I delete myself from the scheduling page. We have an amical discussion that basically end with "We want games about these themes and we hope you find a group that suits you well, that shouldn't be hard"<br/>Let me tell you that it is hard.<br/><br/>I want to learn how to say "no\u201d better, safer. I know I'm hypersensitive. I know I'm the weird one. I know I am super hypocritical with my ultraviolent, oversexed characters. But violence is violence and sex is sex and as long as they're separate, I'm good. If they even approach each other, I'm out.<br/><br/>And is it really so strange that I, fear-ridden and jumpy human being, don't want to be the only woman in a room with men I don't know that well, playing Gang Rape or Death Love Doom?<br/>Not saying no woman could handle it or could value the experience. But I'm not there.<br/><br/>And Phoenix182. Placing the burden on me, saying it's on me. The old "no-one has the right to not be offended" spiel. Why do you think I even started this thread, asking how <em>I</em> could improve, asking how I can set boundaries, participate, build trust, engage and protect myself, rather than starting a thread about "the offensive assholes, ban them, censor them with fire"?<br/><br/>Because hell yes I blame myself. After meeting over a dozen of them and one of me, how could I not think I was the weird one, the outsider, the one who needs to change, to leave.<br/><br/>I want to play role-playing games because I hate myself and I want to leave and I can't leave myself.

I made that choice knowing that I would never alter my own behavior or statements enough to be 'socially acceptable' by most standards, and so don't risk putting others out by bothering to associate with them. I am what I am, period, and anyone who is ok with that is free to come associate with me. So far has worked out incredibly well for me, despite the rarity of my views/personality.<br/><br/>Only sad thing is, not everyone is that bloody lucky! I wish I knew a way to make it less about luck, but the only thing I can come up with is networking/research/communication.

You don't have to explain why -- you don't have to say 'no dogs: I have a phobia of dogs because of this time I was a kid and...' you just say 'no dogs: please.' And that's that. <br/><br/>And even in groups without a specific tool like that, I think 'no dogs, please' should be a worthy/adequate request. Yes, it's possible someone might deduce that you have a phobia of dogs, but they might also guess you had a dog who died recently, or any number of other things. Some people might push for an explanation, at which point I think 'I don't really want to get into it, I just don't want any dogs, if that's okay' is the way to go. And if that's not enough, then this isn't the group for you.<br/><br/>I mean if you are actually unable to say the word or describe the thing even in general terms, then it gets harder, for sure. If I was in that kind of situation, I would consider printing out a statement in advance, either to hand to someone or to read directly from (if that will make it easier), OR trying to have the discussion by email beforehand (possibly using a pre-written statement, again.)<br/><br/>Or I mean the truly ideal situation is probably having a friend you play games with, who can come along and can advocate on your behalf -- or I mean, even if they just like, drop you off at the game and stay to have a chat about it with the group, or whatever. (You don't even need to be in the room, who knows.) I can see how this could be super embarassing, and some groups would definitely be weirded out, but I know that if this happened at one of our public drop-in events or with a new player to a group I was in, I would absolutely understand why they might need this sort of help communicating those needs.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439047/#Comment_439047" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T15:32:22+00:00" title="October  5, 2014  3:32PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes to this!

See, I'm more used to being the <i>offender</i>, and when I read "setting boundaries" I implicitly read that as meaning "how can I not hurt other people?", which is what I believe I have myself become better at doing over time. For those few times I was the one who was hurt, I'm used to place 100% of the blame on others: it was the other player's responsibility to notice I was fucking crying for real, it was the designers fault that they had fucking designed the game specifically to hurt players, it was the organizer's fault if I wasn't given an opportunity to debrief when I fucking needed it.<br/><br/>Thus, <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>, I'm sorry: I've no idea how to make myself useful to you. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>I do agree with most things <a href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">@IceCreamEmperor</a> wrote, but I think it boils down to: in every single moment of my waking life, <b>it totally is my basic human responsibility to not hurt other people</b>.<br/><br/>(Which, by the way, has nothing remotely to do with <i>offending</i>. I we were talking about <i>offending</i>, then I would probably agree with <a href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">@phoenix182</a>, but we aren't: we're talking about hurting others and people getting hurt.)<br/><br/>Apparently, people -- some people at least -- do hurt other people <i>deliberately</i>. Beats me why someone would want to do that, but still it happens. There are even those who design games which are meant to hurt their players --- I could name a few, but I don't really want to go there.<br/><br/>Most of the time, though, I'm going to assume that when people hurt other people that's a mistake, because the offender either didn't know how to prevent harm, or failed to do so. Which means that (concerning the case in point) I don't think it's you who needs to learn techniques for harm prevention, it's the people you play with.<br/><br/>At a minimum, I would say that insisting to play G.R. (or any scenario with such a scary <i>name</i>, really) with someone who didn't previously express any explicit enthusiasm for playing it\u2026 qualifies as an act of absolute lack of any common-sense social skill whatsoever. And the person who brings topic X or Y to a game right <i>after</i> topic X or Y was explicitly singled out as an issue in a lines-and-veils discussion\u2026 what?! It begs some kind of explanation (like, this person actually has very real issues which prevent them from functioning normally in social situations), otherwise this particular individual is trying to hurt other people deliberately, a.k.a. being a huge asshole. O_o<br/><br/>Really, when I treat new friends to dinner, I'm the one responsible for asking whether anybody is a vegetarian, before I go on and serve them meat --- because it's the sensible thing to do as a host.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439059/#Comment_439059" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T21:57:17+00:00" title="October  5, 2014  9:57PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a pretty tricky design problem - how to actually and concretely avoid taking the game to unacceptable territories when it is not possible to chart those territories in advance.

I could credit the idea that the only reason we manage to not offend and hurt each other in regular freely expressive play of rpgs is that people are usually not very easy to hurt by the random give and take; take away that default state (however "default" it may be in reality), and it is questionable whether play is possible at all.<br/><br/>(Design thought experiment time: let's say that we're playing a roleplaying game together, but in this game there's a secret topic ban, and you lose if you mention or reference the banned thing. It could be "superheroes", "Cthulhu mythos" or "Monty Python", you don't know because it was chosen randomly in advance and is only known to the referee observing the game. What does the rest of the game look like, and does it have any rules or processes surrounding the topic ban, perhaps to help players avoid stumbling upon it accidentally?)<br/><br/>It's not a solution to the general case of how to accomplish play with any group, any time, but were I regularly experiencing anxiety with new groups, I would maybe explore a gradual, consciously shy strategy of learning to play with a certain set of people, with the goal of building towards roleplaying together. In other words, first learn to know the people so much that you can talk with them about your personal foibles, and only then play self-expressive games like roleplaying games together. Perhaps start by watching movies and playing boardgames together, then move on to talking about personal rpg history, and then if it seems like this particular group of people might enjoy playing together, try to play something simple and predictable. Treat roleplaying more like an act of intimacy than an open social event?<br/><br/>Playing with close friends should help in two ways: they're less likely to offend each other's sensibilities, and when they do they're easier to forgive.<br/><br/>Moving on to a different approach, I think that Ricardo mentioned an interesting and historically viable strategy: play a conservative game with a strong GM. D&amp;D, particularly, has an impressive history as the go-to game for culturally disparate groups and socially dubious situations, and it has generally braved these challenges by being limited enough that it rarely offends anybody. This heritage can easily be seen today in how D&amp;D is often contrasted with new story games: people who dislike and perhaps fear the idea of potentially hurtful and offensive game topics discuss D&amp;D as a safe, harmless alternative that preemptively promises meaningless entertainment. "I don't need pretentious politics in my elf-games" is a typical example of the sort of rhetoric that comes up, with the implication that D&amp;D is "just a game of pretending to be dwarves and elves", entirely harmless. And that is the truth, if you play it that way!<br/><br/>So what I'm thinking is, if there is an unknown mine field of prohibited content that could ruin the game out there, one strategy I might opt for would be to play a game with a simple, convention-based fiction, one that is unlikely to stray. Nobody needs to chart the minefield or warn anybody away from it if the game is not likely to stray there anyways. The right game might not be D&amp;D, depending on where the mine field lays, but the idea is the same as the one we see in conservative corporate D&amp;D: highly convention-based, limited to official modes of expression, and so on.<br/><br/>A related idea would be to play with a group that is unlikely to press yours or anybody else's buttons. Playing with children works wonders in this regard, although experience tells me that a certain percentage of roleplayers are socially oblivious enough that they'll <i>still</i> do their off-color joking when you've got a couple of nieces or whatever at the table. That's only the more basement-grown fringe, most gamers will surely clean up their act in the presence of minors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439060/#Comment_439060" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T22:04:31+00:00" title="October  5, 2014 10:04PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm failing to see how you're the problem, <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>. Yes, clearly you have some fragilities, perhaps even an unusual number of them, but, you know, it's not like you're just sitting on your problems or refusing to acknowledge them.<br/><br/>I'm actually situated in a similar place to you, gaming-frustrations-wise, although not for the same reasons. I'm lucky enough that I have no problem playing very emotionally intense games, even those with pretty extreme content. But after doing that sort of thing for awhile, I've realized that my heart and soul will always be in fantasy and sci-fi adventure full-length campaigns. The problem is, most people who go in for that sort of thing are insensitive clods who have no understanding of even the basics of what mechanics actually do or how to run an adventure, let alone how to maintain a table that's truly welcoming. As some of your other recent threads have pointed out, even running something that is supposed to be emotionally lightweight like 5E requires a great deal of nuance, particularly when it comes to negotiating the letter and spirit of things like the BIFTs.<br/><br/>I think for the time being running 5E may be your best bet. That way you really can control the emotional content of the game as well as the mechanical honesty. Maybe after awhile you could groom someone else in the group to run.<br/><br/>But seriously, you are in my opinion deserving of nothing but empathy and support!<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439061/#Comment_439061" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T23:31:48+00:00" title="October  5, 2014 11:31PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's definitely a reason the Pathfinder reward cycle is "safe" - because acquisition and power fantasy are two emotional releases that we're explicitly granted these days.

Nowadays the garage punk counterculture aspects are pretty emphasized in the culture, too, what with the OSR demographics consisting of adult men nostalgic for underground fantasy. Raggi is emblematic of the cultural trend.<br/><br/>The game has a solid history of innocent family-friendly fun to it as well, though, if you stick to TSR/WotC corporate materials and attitudes. Admittedly the subject matter is violent, but the mainstream handling of it is strictly cartoon violence, symbolic "you deal 2 points of damage" book-keeping. The character motivations are heroic and cartoony, and the worst thing the bad guys ever did to anyone was putting them in a dungeon jail cell. Death is sort of a conundrum for this sort of AD&amp;D 2nd edition game, admittedly, but my guess is that the GMs who do it don't really feature losing in combat. Regardless, I would say that the <i>role</i> that death has in corporate D&amp;D is so conventional and stylized that it is, in its own way, safe. Similar to how violence in superhero comics or show wrestling is safe.<br/><br/>When suggesting D&amp;D as a safe game to play, I suggest the sort of D&amp;D where you stunt and limit the self-expression of the players, requiring them to act and play by the book; the sort of game where you disallow non-good Alignments and penalize heavily for inappropriate behaviour; the sort where it would be quite beyond the pale to actually describe what that "2 points of damage" means in visceral fictional prose. The game has the tools and the culture for it, despite all the Jim Raggis in the world <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>That's all besides the point, of course, in that we can't prescribe what feels safe to other people. For other suggestions as to games that feature predictable content and that might be psychologically safe for a given person even with a random selection of coplayers, I might suggest <i>Paranoia</i> and <i>Ars Magica</i>. The former has oppressive themes, but it is also aggressively asexual, and the comic element should prove distancing when it comes to violence. The latter is a non-violent and non-sexual game to begin with, centering upon mutual appreciation of history - relatively unlikely to take a turn towards any remotely controversial subject, unless the players explicitly seek for such.<br/><br/>Of course those are just a couple of options - my point mainly is that perhaps the choice of a game with predictable content could act as a superior means of avoiding those psychological triggers, rather than choosing a game where such are a possibility and then trying to avoid them by other techniques. Of course this might come to feel like it limits gaming experience, but that's the tradeoff here - either you skirt close to the minefield and risk difficulties, or you keep well away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439067/#Comment_439067" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T01:13:40+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  1:13AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2014 1:15AM by Rafu.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited to say: crossposted with lots of people who express similar concerns!<br/><br/>People, D&amp;D is <i>everything</i> but a "safe" game. It's a game about conquering fortunes and/or solving problems through the use of <i>violence</i> (and guile, if you play that way). Most D&amp;D games feature some form of racial profiling, colonial aggression, genocidal violence, armed robbery, theft and political murder as things "heroes" do. Sooner or later, in a game of D&amp;D, somebody is going to propose <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2014/07/31/interrogation-how-about-we-dont-make-a-game-of-torture/" rel="nofollow">torture</a> as an information-gathering technique (because frankly it belongs), somebody else is going to be grossed out (because it's gross, to say the least) and the DM, being a decent human being, has to find some justification for torture <i>not</i> to happen in the fiction of play.<br/><br/>Really, I read most calls of "I don't need pretentious politics in my elf-games" as "Please don't point it out to me that what I enjoy for my entertainment is full of problematic content, I much prefer to feign obliviousness to that."<br/><br/>It's true that, technically, a DM can censor all other players' contributions to the shared imagined space, but only after they have spoken their mind! As a safety tool, this is actually inferior to or no better than a mere X-card:\n<ul><li>it relies on the DM knowing about everybody's issues and remembering, or being so-much-better than the other players at picking up unspoken social clues; and this is while juggling a dozen other tasks as well</li>\n<li>it's the same old input-filtering device for <i>all</i> issues: legitimate creative differences, miscommunication about minutiae of fictional positioning, safety issues, everything. Since it gets safety muddled up with less important concerns, the DM needs either to address all concerns the same way - which may lead to a player fighting them over another player's safety mistaking it for something else - or to point out it's for player safety, which may drift into explaining and justification - which is bad, because it makes the hurt person feel awkward on top of being hurt.</li>\n<li>even more problematically, having the DM as the one filter makes each other player not responsible for behaving: it legitimizes an habit of bringing up shit to see what sticks.

I mean, are you assuming that there is some unspoken universal standard of problematic content that real situations reflect more or less perfectly? And if people are emotionally vulnerable in some regard, then that vulnerability will necessarily express itself along this continuum of problematic content?<br/><br/>I'm asking, because to me that seems like a hazardous assumption to make, yet I can't really understand your list of unsafe D&amp;D content as anything but a list of things that anybody and everybody should find unsafe according to you. Yet, here I have a close acquaintance, a long-time D&amp;D player, who will quite literally break down and cry if we ever play <i>My Life with Master</i> (a grown man, brought to an utterly vulnerable place by a game that generates horror out of domination relationship narratives), yet who continues to consider his weekly D&amp;D session (5th edition for the last month or so) the safest, most companionable and life-affirming hobby he has in his life. For this particular real person it would be utterly ridiculous to call D&amp;D-as-they-play-it an unsafe game, the conventional content of the game with its safe elf/dwarf bickering and other cliches are where he is best at home. It's not a case of "feigning obliviousness", it's that he genuinely is not bothered by the things you list - either because they're not present in their game (regardless of what is present in your D&amp;D game, note), or because they're not difficult for these people.<br/><br/>My point is that I don't really see this question of difficult personal boundaries as a political one, which is what you seem to be making of it. We can play commendably liberal games all day every day, yet that does nothing to guarantee that the game is actually psychologically safe for actual human individuals who may or may not have their own various hangups about different things in the world. We may be able to make a normative list of things that <i>should</i> make people uncomfortable (according to us wise, wise people), but that doesn't really have anything to do with what people actually feel comfortable or uncomfortable about.<br/><br/>It would ironically be a very useful substitute tool for the X-card and such if we <i>could</i> create some sort of safe/unsafe list in advance. You see, that would enable us to unequivocally go for the simple solution of blaming people for their feelings: if you introduce the a priori unforgivable content, then it's your fault this other person got hurt, and if you got hurt by allowed content, then that's your fault for being a pussy. Simple, clean - and utterly unrealistic regarding the human condition. This approach is often seen in Internet discussions, perhaps because people are generally used to solving human issues by assigning blame as a step towards determining who needs to give way in a disagreement; however, as an abstract design tool this is useless when we're asking how to <i>avoid offense</i>, not just who's to blame for an offense that already occurred.<br/><br/>(The ironic observer might note here that the "objective fault" strategy has been historically quite popular in attempting to build communal standards of acceptable content for new art forms. D&amp;D, for example, has had its own content guidelines since the late '80s, American comics since the late '50s, movies since the '60s... I guess everybody can make up their own minds as to where the fault lies if a PG-rated movie offends or hurts a particularly vulnerable person - if fault indeed needs to be assigned at all. All I know is that the objective fault strategy leaves people whose personal sensibilities do not match the objective standards pretty unsupported and unjustified; it's <i>your fault</i> if you don't like our wholesome family entertainment, decreed as such by the governing body of the medium!)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439072/#Comment_439072" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T02:48:09+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  2:48AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another great post.

Don't sell it short, though - the strength of the GM filter is not in short term tactical work, but rather in instituting a longer-term campaign ethos that better accords with the standards the GM perceives as befitting a hobby worthy of their attention. (I express it that way because I'd like to say "hobby befitting of freemen", or as a better English translation a "hobby befitting gentlepeople", but I recognize that different people self-identify in different social groups, so ultimately it's just a matter of asking what manner of behaviour you deem acceptable for yourself and your own peer group. Are e.g. sexist jokes really up to your standards as a group, that's the question, no matter why your standards might be whatever they are.)<br/><br/>As a concrete example of how the GM may well be a powerful tool in building up the community standards, an anecdote from a couple years back when I did a lot of GMing for mixed-gender teenager groups for various reasons:<br/><br/>Finland has a rich linguistic history of swearing, and it is perhaps somewhat more acceptable for a wider range of social situations than it is in English - more of a rhetorical emphasis thing than "I'm a crude redneck" thing. (I personally suspect that this is an outcome of the republican/egalitarian political culture here; it's more acceptable for people to own up to earthly cultural ancestry and there's less pressure to try to pass for higher class. But I digress.) There is a wide range of more or less crude and unsavoury swear words for your delectation, and naturally their acceptability and stylistic range change with politics and demographics - different age groups and social groups use different terminology.<br/><br/>Now, one particularly annoying feature of traditional youth language in Finland is the use of homophobic terminology as swear words. I'm particularly keen about this myself, as I grew up with this vocabulary, and still use it by accident, despite not liking it myself anymore. It's a strange feeling to have an aesthetic tool-set that I like in terms of poetics and good phraseology of the language, but that I detest in terms of its subtext. It's just not cool to my mind to call something "homo" when you mean that it's flawed or built wrong, even if it rings well rhetorically.<br/><br/>(Out of general interest in swearing culture, it might be interesting to note that in my particular sociocultural box religious swears have maintained their ironical 20th century position as old rhetorical standbys, while the homosexual and racist terminology has seen the sort of downturn in acceptability that I describe above on my own part. My sense is that most of us in my generation strive to replace those politically unacceptable ranges of expression with scatological and sexual swears - I particularly favour "vittu" - "cunt" -  myself as a homely, harmless and life-affirming alternative.)<br/><br/>OK, so this homophobic swearing culture came up a couple years back when I was GMing for a bunch of teenagers, and I had an opportunity to squash it from a position of authority <i>because</i> I was the GM, the gatekeeper of the game, the elder statesman of the proceedings, and so forth. It was a teenager boy using a particularly strong homophobic swear-word in a purely rhetorical context (not directed at anyone real or imagined, but the particular term is an old rhetorical standby in the local lexicon), in passing, without any particular thought put to it. I even used the "not at my table" authority talk that I usually <i>never</i> draw on in gaming. Didn't make a big deal of it or get angry or anything, I just explained what I said above, that this terminology had grown to bother me over the years, and let's pay attention to whether we really want to use it - remember that you never know if any of your friends might be homosexual themselves, so there's clear and present risk in gratifying our poetic senses in this regard, even if we mean "nothing" by it.<br/><br/>So my point here with this rambling anecdote is this: during the next four years of playing with these particular youths, seeing them go through their high school, I never once heard bigoted swearing from them. (This is somewhat exceptional for Finnish youth culture, although hopefully not so much in the future.) I don't really consider this any major feat in defense of liberal values, as the people in question are quite liberal themselves as far as I know, so it was just a minor matter of terminology adjustment. The point is that it was easy, it stuck long-term, and it proved that a GM can quite effortlessly do fine-tuning on the ethos of their game table. I didn't even need to hesitate about lecturing the other players, being the authority figure at the table just made it natural for me to wield the power to set standards to my liking.<br/><br/><i>That</i> being the context for thinking about the GM as a possible tool in setting limits and standards, I can't help but think about whether a sensitive GM who strives for a generally safe and welcoming environment, and pays particular attention to whether all players are enjoying themselves, might be an effective tool for the kind of socio-psychological situation Sandra is facing here. The GM has notable advantages against the X-card, note: he's powerful and doesn't need to hesitate to use power and draw attention to himself, for instance.<br/><br/>From a player perspective the "use a strong GM to set the standards" might work best by playing with a trusted GM who you are comfortable sharing your difficulties with. This isn't a complete solution as to what to do at a convention game or such, but I feel like it <i>is</i> entirely viable at a home game. I've myself in the past <i>been</i> that strong GM who looks after shy, more uncertain and vulnerable players, and to me it's seemed like it's worked pretty well at times. Specifically: when a player says something accidentally offensive, it's much easier socially when the GM can be the one to ask them to drop that line of talk. There's no need to even explain, you don't need to tell anybody at the table that this other player here is a basket case who can't handle that sort of joking. A strong GM can take the onus themselves if an explanation is truly warranted and the actual beneficiary of the policy doesn't (yet) feel comfortable airing their foibles openly with the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439076/#Comment_439076" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T03:33:15+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  3:33AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess my pro-GM theory can be expressed more succinctly (as is often the case with my rambling): being how rpg tables already often include natural authority figures for whom it costs very little in social capital to ensure a safe place, why not put that authority machine to work doing something useful for a change? Less worrying about the entertaining plot, more worrying about meeting everybody in the group in a creative place where enjoyable cooperation becomes possible. Of course this can only work if the person with the vulnerabilities is the GM themselves, or if they can trust the GM enough to get them to work for them.<br/><br/>I guess this function of the GM role is such a secondary concern due to how normative and regular it is to assume that everybody is <i>obviously</i> comfortable with <i>ordinary</i> play interactions. I guess that this happens because it is true - most groups and gamers probably get by pretty well without having to worry about sensitivity issues. As is often the case with minority concerns, the fact that the majority is doing just fine doesn't really do anything for the minority who are having issues.<br/><br/>(Reminds me of the way Forgite scene has sometimes been characterized as a minority effort supported by people who are too dumb to make "real" rpgs work. I guess that's one way to explain why I've had such intractable problems getting trad games to work. From the perspective of a person who <i>does</i> have these issues with trad games, the question of whether they work just fine for other people is sort of a secondary, academic interest. Similarly, the question of whether e.g. D&amp;D is objectionable to the majority or a moral majority of some sort isn't relevant to somebody for whom it <i>is</i> personally bothersome.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439077/#Comment_439077" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T04:32:19+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  4:32AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...but there's nobody that's going to point to an X-Card when I jovially slap an NPC on the back and say "HOW'S IT GOING THERE JIMBO" even though I may be ruining the game twice as much.</blockquote>\nI use the X-Card routinely in convention games and, other than its value in establishing initial expectations, the only times I've used it during play have been to enforce tone.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439079/#Comment_439079" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T04:44:24+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  4:44AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2014 4:45AM by AsIf.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are activist techniques that are used to assuage social situations and maintain productive group cohesion.

Among those is the use of <i>Temp Checks</i>, which are periodic pauses during the meeting in order to get a general feel for how everyone is doing at the moment.  (Some meetings use assigned "Vibeswatchers" or "Caretakers" whose job is to watch the mood of the room and stop negative processes from continuing, although this is admittedly rather far for the typical gaming group to go.)<br/><br/>Another valuable technique is <i>Taking Short Breaks</i> from (during) the process (game) itself.  Just five minutes is fine.

Few games do that.<br/><br/>I played a lot of collaborative storytelling games, where some had despair as the major key element, and something I noticed was that the group fell back onto sexual violence, or put the characters into positions where they had to use brutal violence against their will, to provoke that feeling. It became so common to use for a while that we started to say, in a humorous way, "OK, and here comes the incest part again".<br/><br/>It's nowadays my belief that if any participant needs to drag in sexual violence to be able to "shock" the others, it's a failure for the game. Using that topic is a cheap shot in trying to provoke certain feelings in the other person (or self). Here is something I think <b>Fiasco</b> does well with the relationship building mechanic. The mechanic feeds what the game should be about and, unless there is sexual violence in those tables, 9 out of 10 times (or less) there wont occur any sexual violence. I discovered that if the game doesn't feed something to the participants, the cheap shots are coming up sooner or later because people will run out of ideas.<br/><br/>This is not the only way to solve this issue, of course. Create a structure to put up a decent dilemma situation is another way to go. Few game manage to do that, however. Even games that say that they do that, like <b>Mouse Guard</b>.<b> Svart av kval, vit av lust</b>, where despair and dilemma are key ingredients, lacks the structure all together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439088/#Comment_439088" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T07:44:13+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  7:44AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Really, I read most calls of "I don't need pretentious politics in my elf-games" as "Please don't point it out to me that what I enjoy for my entertainment is full of problematic content, I much prefer to feign obliviousness to that."</blockquote>\nOh god, yes. I don't have a problem with people wanting power-fantasy; sometimes I want to play in such a style myself. But I would never refuse to acknowledge the problematic assumptions such a genre makes.<br/><br/>I stand by the idea that just because you like something that has some problematic content doesn't mean *you* embody that problem. <i>The Book of the New Sun</i>, for example, is *incredibly* misogynistic. It's also a sublimely beautiful work of symbolist science-fantasy. If someone said they didn't like it because of the sexism, I wouldn't argue with them!<br/><br/>In exactly the same way, I wouldn't argue with someone who said they didn't like "straight-up" D&amp;D for its colonialism, violence, etc. It might not deter me from playing in that sort of style, but I would never accuse my interlocutor of being the one who is injecting politics.<br/><br/>Completely agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> that simply injecting "shocking" content into games to try to make them emotionally meaningful is, at best, counterproductive in the long run.<br/><br/>One other thing I want to say: John Stavropoulos, the inventor of the X-Card, is also the single best GM I've ever seen; in <i>particular</i> he is great at noticing when someone is feeling uncomfortable or left out and making sure their needs are addressed.

Before a session, you make a list of subjects that are banned from the world. So you can put "sexual violence" or "monsters" or "dogs" or "racist slurs" or "violence against children" or "sub/dom relationships" on that list. You can put whatever you need to put <i>before</i> play starts.<br/><br/>It is not an objective list of things that will always be harmful to anyone. It is a subjective list of things that should be kept out of this game for these players. <br/><br/>Of course, the limitation here is that you have to pipe up at the very beginning of play and say "I want dogs to be on that list." And this is a rather vulnerable thing to do with strangers. To some extent, it requires that the group already be safe enough that you trust them not to judge you about your triggers.\n<blockquote>You see, that would enable us to unequivocally go for the simple solution of blaming people for their feelings: </blockquote>\nI'm not sure how this follows. If you are making a "banned subjects" list just so that you can blame people for being hurt by subjects that are not on the list...why would you do that? That means you are going out of your way to be extra un-safe instead of extra safe. I don't get it. \n<blockquote>if you introduce the a priori unforgivable content, then it's your fault this other person got hurt, </blockquote>\nYes. Correct. If someone says "no dogs" before play starts, and you unleash a pack of hounds into the game, then yes, you are a jerk. They were very clear about their needs and you disrespected them.\n<blockquote>and if you got hurt by allowed content, then that's your fault for being a pussy. </blockquote>\nNo. It just means you didn't realize that this content would be hurtful to you, or you didn't imagine the game proceeding in this direction so you didn't even think to add it to the banned list. So this is the time to make use of the X-card. And next time you play, you'll know something new that you need to add to the banned list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439113/#Comment_439113" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T13:53:20+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  1:53PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was merely being ironically snarky about the idea of universal community standards being relevant and capable of being written down effectively, James - no need to pick over my straw man with a comb. It happens to be the case that I don't hold a pregame lines/veils discussion in any great regard as a technique <i>either</i>, but at least it makes some sense when applied to a particular group instead of trying to apply a Comics Code of some sort.<br/><br/>In this particular case I would expect a pregame discussion to be an otherwise viable method, except that it's somewhat humiliating to be the only player asking for such (and quite possibly the only player with any real demands) in a group you don't know very well, and everybody doesn't always understand or care enough about such special requests. Sandra described the latter effect in passing earlier, in fact - how a certain kind of game and player almost takes the lines and veils you talk about as instructions on what points to hit. So it could be both awkward and ineffectual, I don't wonder why one might wish to look for other tactics in dealing with the issue.<br/><br/>(I'm on record as considering such a pregame discussion ineffective in certain ways, particularly as an aesthetic tool. The reason for why I'm moderately more optimistic about it in this particular case is that we're specifically discussing serious personal psychic fragility triggered by particular topics - a more serious thing altogether than "I'm bored with lightsabers". That could, given the right circumstances, be effectively worked around by a serious and targeted pregame discussion that engages the entire group in support. Of course that's only possible for a stable group, not so much for use in casual situations.)<br/><br/>I distinctly remember that we had a thread about lines/veils pregame discussions earlier this summer here. <i>Microscope</i> and <i>Capes</i> were mentioned, at least, as games that make these into explicit parts of the rules. I felt that the strengths and drawbacks of the technique in general were well presented in that discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/williamj35" title="williamj35"><img alt="williamj35" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/williamj35">williamj35</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439117/#Comment_439117" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T14:43:59+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  2:43PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I was merely being ironically snarky about the idea of universal community standards being relevant and capable of being written down effectively, James - no need to pick over my straw man with a comb. </blockquote>\nMy bad.

Playing story games is not inherently <i>safe</i>. The core method of play consists of people sharing their ideas and fantasies in verbal form. It is a social interaction creating a narrative and every player can throw in their ideas. Even if you are doing an almost purely tactical encounter based D&amp;D game you have the tabletalk. (comparable to Magic: The Gathering mentioned somewhere in this thread)<br/><br/>Of course there also are <i>unsafe</i> game systems and scenarios that have themes wired in one might want to avoid. So not playing those is one way to be <i>safe</i>r. Also if a group you are interested in joining is mentioning playing such a system I would personally ask them what fascinates them about it and if it is their usual fare. If it sticks out from their other choices of games and they seem to be people you want to play with in general. So you get an idea where they are coming from and if they are going for such themes regulary. Anyway those games can be flags and indicators.<br/><br/>Still what makes a game <i>safe</i> is the group you are playing with. A good GM can help moderate but everyone will be bringing content and their attitudes to the table. So having a table full of pals seems the best. (Which might be why the group you started yourself is working still). The regular groups I am in all either started with a core of friends and grew by inviting others or turned into a group of friends as time went on.<br/>As a new player being invited in by friends also gives you the benefit of having a pal there.<br/>If not given the opportunity to have friends I would go with people I feel like I have at least some kind of chemistry with. Who seem like I would like to hang out with them, even if it wasn't just for roleplaying. I try to engage them as people I share a part of my life with and not just players in a game I participate in.<br/><br/>Overall I would say that communication and empathy on both sides is what can make a game safe. That communication and empathy has to come from everyone involved on some level. An idea of boundries and what content is complicated also helps and is a skill to develop. <br/>2097 seems to have hit a cluster of groups wanting to engage such content. In my circles they aren't as common. So maybe it is "bad luck" there or a different culture of gaming.<br/><br/>If I am as a GM including themes and concepts that seem to me like they could cross common boundries I mention that to the group during the pitch. Giving some kind of trigger or content warning. Be it verbally at the table or written out for convention announcements or the introductions of a written form.<br/>As a player I would ask questions too. If it seems like it is going for a theme I could be uncomfortable with or (more likely in my case) it could do the same (or worse) for others. So that I know in which boundries I should keep my descriptions and what themes I can bring up with my character. Also to remind the other players that such boundries exist and might be crossed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/williamj35" title="williamj35"><img alt="williamj35" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/williamj35">williamj35</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439163/#Comment_439163" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T06:32:10+00:00" title="October  7, 2014  6:32AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Summarizing what's been suggested so far (because I want to keep track of it all). Here are some ways we've come up with to make <i>safer</i> play environments:<br/><br/>-Lines/Veils<br/>-Pre-game "movie rating" or "movie-title-as-indicator-of-content" consensus <br/>-Trigger warnings<br/>-X-Card <br/>-Safe words<br/>-"Try a different way"<br/>-"Strong" GM and adventures that have a tight focus on "safe" material<br/>-Attentive and supportive GM<br/>-GM's and groups that don't introduce problematic material with strangers<br/>-Have a buddy who knows your triggers and can advocate for you and/or support you<br/>-Temp Checks<br/>-Short breaks from play<br/>-Group that is sympathetic, like-minded<br/>-Group of players you know and trust<br/>-Group that is balanced in terms of gender, race, etc.<br/>-Group that includes children <br/>-Games with mechanisms that can provide a dark/despairing mood without needing to rely on sexual violence.<br/>-Games that are asexual and/or comedic and light and/or focused on other material in such a way that sexual violence would be difficult to introduce during play<br/><br/>(let me know if I missed something as I was re-reading)<br/><br/><br/>General consensus of the thread as a whole:<br/><br/>All of these have value. All of these have limitations. There is no sure method for creating perfectly safe spaces. There may be situations where the best you can do is simply leave the game and/or group.<br/><br/>I think we've said, basically: No the X-card is not enough. No mechanism is enough. There are lots of things to try, but none -- not even a group of folks you know and trust -- is going to be safe all the time. <br/><br/><br/>My two cents:<br/><br/>1. Approaching a definition: A "safe" group is one that attempts to provide <i>as safe an environment as possible</i> using whatever methods are appropriate to the type and style of play the group wants to engage in. Safe groups are clear about their intended subject matter and the methods they use for ensuring player safety. Safe groups are not necessarily safe for all players. (Maybe "<i>safer</i> groups" would be a better term)<br/><br/>2. I guess one way to get a sense of how safe a group is before playing with them is to ask what methods they use to create a safe environment. If they say "None. It's your own responsibility if you get hurt" or "I don't know, we never thought about it" then you know something right away about the relative safety of the group.

I've noticed this before, how there is a relative paucity of rules ideas out there for aspects of play that move close to higher-order social and creative concerns, while there are like a quarnozillion dice mechanics ideas. I guess that's just the shape of how things are.<br/><br/>As a pure invention on the spot, it occurs to me that the longterm/after-the-fact policing of standards could be invested in an outsider instead of the GM: when something unpleasant occurs, you tell about it to an outside authority who can then take steps towards closer overwatch or general correction of the atmosphere of the group. They could act in between individual sessions, come to the next session to start it with a lecture, or whatever. Advantages are anonymity and equality, as an outside referee can act upon any difficulties without drawing attention to the original complainant or having to first best the group's social alphas in a battle of wills before imposing on them. I guess that something like this would work best if your game happened at some sort of chaperoned youth center or such, where it's a given that any activities in the location are the responsibility of an overwatch authority.<br/><br/>I got the idea from the practice of having a friend call you during a blind date to provide a graceful exit or additional security.

Just for laughs, it could even be a big red light at the corner of the table which says "Red Alert", or even "Self-Destruct Sequence Initiated".<br/><br/>Every player has the ability to discreetly press a button somewhere, turning on the alert anonymously, when a difficult subject is breached and they don't want to go there. When the light goes on, the whole group tries to dial down or fade to black, until the issue disappears from play, and the person in question turns off the alert light.<br/><br/>It's like the X-Card, but anonymous.<br/><br/>You won't know who set off the alert or why, just that a problem of some kind is happening, and then, as a group, you can brainstorm if something's offensive/difficult in the current scene/game, in general terms.<br/><br/>I think it could add another layer of security for some people.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, nothing will work unless the people in the group are sensitive and willing to accomodate other people's needs.

What I'm about to say about the X-Card is, as far as I can tell, beside the point there, and I wish I could give more useful advice.<br/><br/>For me, one thing the X-Card does, I think, is to put on the table that we want safer games, that people have the right to say, "Hey, this thing here, I need it stopped", and that we all have the responsibility to create a safer environment. I don't think anyone's ever touched it in the campaign where I put it on the table -- but we use it. We say, "Can I X-Card doing that?" "Hey, I'm really sorry, but can I retroactively X-Card that thing you did? I'm realizing now it's triggery for me." The card reminds us that we can do this, and that when someone else does it, our job is to respect that.<br/><br/>But, in a situation where one player is saying, "I don't want X" and the rest of the group is saying, "Well, we all do, so the only option we can give you is to not play with you" -- a lot of safety techniques won't work, because the group is saying, "No. This is not a safe space for you."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439231/#Comment_439231" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-08T00:10:23+00:00" title="October  8, 2014 12:10AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the theme Sandra and Lisa touched upon there is a good one: despite the discussion tendency to address "safer" games as an unconditional good, it is in fact a creative preference/need/priority. It's the old "nobody gets hurt" vs. "I will not abandon you" dichotomy, basically: for many people the attempt to bring safety measures into the game is basically pissing on their fun, because they want to play with a different social contract. Sort of similar to how biking helmets can be perceived as an unconditional good by some at the same time as others perceive them, and the public insistence on them, to be ruining their biking fun.<br/><br/>I can say this because I'm usually, left to my own devices, very much a proponent and practitioner of unsafe gaming in nearly all senses of the word. (I say "nearly all" because I've never really seen the point in self-destructive and stupid behavior, so you won't really see me e.g. falling off a roof dead drunk after a D&amp;D session any time soon...) Whether it's a choice about an experimental game that could prove unentertaining, or about spontaneous creative risk that might provoke the other players, or about playing a game that might shake me up emotionally, I find myself gravitating towards what I perceive as the more ambitious, more novel and more exhilarating option. In other words, the problem of how to make a game safer is actually quite novel to me, simply because I usually spend all my time figuring out how to make it more <i>powerful</i>, which is in many ways the opposite of safe.<br/><br/>(It should not need to be said that while this temperament has made me many like-minded friends over the years, it does mean that I have offended frailer hobbyists on occasion with hard play. I'm trying to be better about it nowadays with new acquaintances, of course; age brings wisdom and so on. Most of the time, with most people, it is possible to discover a creative compromise that satisfies everybody's needs for particular sorts of safety and particular sorts of creativity.)<br/><br/>It is good to be conscious of this phenomenon, as it explains much of the obscure resistance that safety measures encounter in dialogue and practice. For example, when a thread about this topic gets a reply questioning the necessity and desirability of safety, it's probably not really intended to question the validity of the premise; rather, it's an expression of the opposite creative drive, from a person who enjoys a surfeit of trust and feels annoyed by the mere idea that somebody might want to interrupt their good flow at the game table with an X-card or other safety measure. I feel like this has historically been a bit of an obstacle to dealing with the subject of safety in gaming; the topic has not been taken as seriously as it could be due to the way it is perceived as a creative threat.<br/><br/>I won't need to look far for a practical example of what creative resistance to safety looks like, as over the last couple of years our local old school D&amp;D has revealed some pretty serious creative differences between players who want D&amp;D to be about risk and challenge, and players who want D&amp;D to be about adventure and (fictional) accomplishment. Basically the question is about safety, as some players truly hate the nihilistic, stark failures of old school D&amp;D, while others revel in the feeling of genuine challenge and emotional stake it brings. Things have progressed to a point where the more extreme wings of the safety-vs-challenge split basically won't play together anymore: the hardcore challenge-addicts grow vaguely bored and contemptuous of the more balanced, toy-like modern D&amp;D, while the softcore players grow terrified of the increasingly sharp, merciless and procedurally clean games run with systems like Mentzer, LotFP and various homebrews.<br/><br/>(I should clarify that the creative discord I describe regarding our local D&amp;D circles is precisely that, <i>creative</i> - there's no social animosity, just an increasing recognition that when it comes to this highly specific form of gaming, we practically speaking enjoy nearly opposite kinds of play. Causes a lot of debate about the theory of the game, of course, but it's pretty clear that the divide is here to stay.)<br/><br/>In fact, getting back to the topic of techniques - insofar as I am correct in recognizing that some players around here prefer e.g. Pathfinder or D&amp;D 4th or 5th over less mainstream options because they're <i>safer</i>, then we should be asking what is it that makes them so! It's not an X-card, certainly, and I don't think it's the GM maintaining a more even-keeled game, either. So what is it that makes one D&amp;D table a distressing stress machine, while another is a wish-fulfillment pastime?<br/><br/>Phrased like that, I think it's pretty obvious that the primary safety strategy of D&amp;D lies in making the content and outcomes of play more predictable while reducing the personal stakes the players have in the outcomes. Specifically, the kind of D&amp;D that is recognized as preferable by my safety-oriented D&amp;D gamer friends features a heavy focus on balanced combat encounters, character builds and essentially linear plots, all of which work to reduce the risks of failure and the consequences of such failure. In other words: players rarely lose in this type of D&amp;D, and if they do, it's not really considered their fault - it was the fault of the GM for misbalancing the encounter, the fault of the game system for being unbalanced, etc. All this means that failure is more rare, and when it occurs it doesn't hit as hard as it would in a game that emphasizes personal responsibility for success.<br/><br/>It is notable that these structural safety/unsafety strategies do go hand in hand with commensurate content strategies: safe D&amp;D tends to feature literarily, culturally "safe" content - established genre tropes - while unsafe D&amp;D tends to feature unexpected, novel phantasmagorias that might prove surprisingly unsettling as literary ideas in addition to being game mechanically unbalanced.<br/><br/>In summation, it seems that at least in some cases local gaming culture successfully establishes safe gaming spaces without explicitly asking what any particular individual would consider safe: rather, players gravitate towards games that offer consistent, predictable experiences that are unlikely to be downers. It's a sort of consumer market approach to safety - make games that are safe and fun to experience by the customer.<br/><br/>I do realize that I somehow managed to ramble back to the point I started with on the last page of the thread - that the choice of an appropriate game goes a long way towards avoiding psychologically difficult game situations.

Sorry.)<br/><br/>When you teach sex ed, and the discussion topic for the day is making out, there are some things you do to make it a safe and successful occasion. You have everyone sit at a desk, for instance, not on couches together. You make sure the lights are bright and if possible fluorescent. Your goal is to <i>pre-set implicit but strong boundaries</i>, so that the sexually-charged material doesn't make the discussion into a sexual occasion.<br/><br/>When you go out with someone new, on the other hand, and it's the end of the date and you feel like making out with them, there are some <i>entirely other</i> things you do to make it safe and successful. You choose your setting on purpose - someplace public-ish, vs your living room, vs your bedroom. You watch your date for how well they respect your boundaries beforehand, when makeouts aren't yet on the table. Maybe you arrange to have a friend call you at 10:00, in case you want the out. Your goal is to set yourself up to <i>negotiate your boundaries from a position of safety</i>, on the fly.<br/><br/>One occasion's safety techniques are poorly suited to the other occasion. Would you arrange to have a friend call you in the middle of teaching?

I happened to overhear the table next to us; three guys, none of whom I've ever seen at a con or online, and I hear them talking about RPG:s. Unethically but understandably, my ears pick up. But what do I find: that they're planning a World of Darkness game with a character (not sure if PC or NPC) who abuses kids.<br/>This city! This hobby!

At a certain level the creation of rules for higher-order interactions stops being "a game" and becomes more like the pursuit of a prescriptive or mandatory social praxis.  This can push into areas of ideology and even political doctrine, and cannot help but include one's personal, theoretical, habitual, or unprovable ideas about how the world works, or how groups work.  The problem is that those ideas - each "correct" in its own right and from a given perspective - can span the entire breadth of human experience and social understanding.  They not only differ from culture to culture and group to group, but maybe even from session to session, person to person, or within the same person at different phases in their life.  That's a complication.<br/><br/>One reason established conventions like "Robert's Rules of Order" or "X Cards" are so commonly relied on despite their imperfections is simply the fact that they have a <i>precedence</i> which makes it easier to consider them as "valid" and "given".  They're useful because they're <i>already there</i>, instantly available without debate, like the idea of "forming a queue" or "majority rule".  Exactly because they are <i>not</i> discussed or brainstormed, but adopted whole-cloth.  "Good, now that we know what procedures we're using, we can get on with doing the actual thing we want to do."<br/><br/>Because only wonks really enjoy spending time talking about the theoretical mechanics of socio-political processes.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>To complicate matters further, people take totally different stances on the whole idea of playing an RPG at all.   One says "This is a relaxing way of having fun" while another says "This is a serious artistic medium and I'm here to perform", plus umpteen other positions, all equally valid from their own perspectives.<br/><br/>Here, the Auteur GM has an advantage.  In the world of Art, we at least have the expectation - the tacit certainty - that the artist is in control of all epistemological stuff (the "rules" of how to understand, operate within, or interact with this particular piece of art).  This gives the artist a degree of certainty exceeding even that of Robert's Rules; the artist IS the source of the world depicted by their art, and if anyone should know <i>how</i> you are to experience that art, they would be the one who could tell you.  (Although of course, if they <i>don't</i> tell you, you're on your own.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Further complication still: Who exactly is the "artist"?  The game designer?  The GM?  <br/>I think it's both, plus players as well, but in different ways.<br/><br/>With whom does the responsibility for creating higher-order social rules lay?  I think it trickles down a binary tree: The designer has the first option of advocating or establishing higher-order social rules, and may even implement them within the game mechanics themselves.  But if the designer abstains from this, the onus will fall on the GM to do so, and if the GM doesn't either establish such rules or personify them literally (as "rulings"), the onus will fall to the group as a whole - who will also have to come up with procedures for adopting their own new rules!<br/><br/>This is much easier when you already have established social relations within the group itself.  In such a case it can go pretty much unspoken, until a moment of uncertainty arises, and then it can be handled on an ad-hoc basis.  Many game systems deliberately eschew meta-rules for this exact reason.  More interested in writing narrative toolsets than social rulesets, their authors expect or assume that the individual GM or group will make up their own mind about that stuff.  They expect or assume that people who gather in a regular group already have some preferred or habitual methodologies for talking, arguing, and resolving higher-order debates.  Even if that methodology is "the GM is always right".  At least it's certain.  Mussolini made the trains run on time.<br/><br/>For relative strangers, it is more difficult.  Thankfully for such groups, it turns out that meta-rules (like the X card) can indeed be application-agnostic, since they are systems in their own right.  You just gotta choose one and make sure everyone sticks to it.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Final complication, linked to the first: This shit is basically BORING and the opposite of play.<br/><br/>Invite a newbie to what you promise will be a fun and exciting game, and start off by spending an hour talking about social contracts and shared creative agendas.  Explain all the jargon terms such as "lines", "veils", "triggers", "CA", "TA", and "x cards".  Explain their histories and justifications.  Explain that the group must determine its own procedures and agendas before play can begin.  Take votes.  Attain consensus.

Specifically, my everyday play here in Helsinki mostly happens in such steel-hard macho environs that even proposing the X-card would be somewhat ludicrous. When I consider how <i>I myself</i> would hesitate to actually use the X-card here, despite being a clique leader and social insider, I can only imagine how the sort of introvert, frail or uncertain person <i>who actually needs it</i> would be able to use the X-card in this type of gaming culture. Take the somewhat touchy gamer I discussed earlier in relation to MLwM; the only way he has ever been able to suggest that he's hurt or distressed or angry about something at the game table is by spiraling sullenness (politely ignored by the other players), followed by an emotional breakdown of whatever degree, bowing out and perhaps apologizing later for unsportsmanlike conduct. I can't really see this person using the X-card except as an utterly self-loathing gesture of martyrdom: "See, I'm such a weak pussy that I'll even call a time-out against your entirely legit play." What's worse, unless explicitly restrained, the almost inevitable reaction of a crowd like this to the use of the X-card - I would bet money that the first thing out of anybody's mouth would be questioning the legitimacy of the X-card call, followed by blaming the wielder for their feelings.<br/><br/>(I know I make us sound horrible there regarding each others' emotional well-being. In the defense of this social microclimate of gaming, I'll say that we value creative camaraderie, sharing social esteem, empathetic dialogue and rational compromises highly; while using an explicit prop like the X-card would feel ridiculous, we often have entirely serious conversations that lead to concrete actions regarding creative interests and social dynamics of play. "You have a problem, you talk about it" and so on, you know how that goes. It's just a cerebrally fronted way of dealing with these issues, one where the greatest sin is unsportsmanlike table conduct, and the greatest virtue is a patient and analytical ability to explain to others what is bothering you, so creative concord can be modified. It's a functional, stereotypically masculine creative environment with the strengths and weaknesses one might expect. Sadly, it's an environment that tends to be rough on certain types of people, even as others prosper.)<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is that thinking about the utility of the X-card around here, I would say that making it anonymous moves it from an extremely marginal, situational option into something that I would not particularly hesitate to use in <i>any</i> game I've played over the last year. Once you turn the X-card anonymous, you're basically talking of a real-time feedback system regarding the enjoyment of play; in fact, there's no reason why such a system couldn't have other buttons aside from "I'm feeling ill" - it'd be just as easy to give anonymous positive feedback about what's happening in the game. Most importantly, this change moves attention away from the "I have a problem with what you are doing" model of X-card intervention, and more towards "we have a problem that needs to be considered". People familiar with the sort of creative environment I describe above can see how this removes a massive amount of social pressure from the user of the X-card: instead of having to now stand up and defend their objection in a <i>debate</i>, they can just let somebody else take up advocating the complaint (if the group's truly committed to rational decision-making, there <i>will</i> be an advocate), and let the problem get fixed by the group without having to themselves become the guarantor of the change.<br/><br/>This shouldn't be taken as a critique of the X-card, I should say; it's just me speculating about how, although these tough dice-jockeys well might have an use for it, the X-card as it is might not fit well in their existing social paradigm. (Specifically, I know that I describe the use of the X-card incorrectly above; that's because a tool and its intended use are different from each other, and barring a controlling interest ensuring the X-card is used correctly, that's about how it would go with these people.) A phone app you can use discreetly or even between sessions to provide anonymous feedback, instant or not, might react in a much less volatile and more constructive way with this sort of intellectual totem pole arrangement of a gaming group <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Of course it would be entirely valid to speculate on whether a group that does not use the X-card naturally has a weakness to their social toolbox; not only different, but flawed. Goes pretty deep into the politics of the matter, but one might argue that a group that cannot deal with emotional reactions empathetically - unless they are couched into compelling rhetoric by a socially creditable individual - is cruel, perhaps consisting of individuals who are detached from their feelings, or possessing of a group culture that prizes individual strength over realism about the human condition. One might well say that if a group is bad at using the X-card, that's all the more reason to challenge them to learn it, and thus learn to listen to each other's feelings without constant testing of the mettle behind them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439322/#Comment_439322" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-10T12:30:52+00:00" title="October 10, 2014 12:30PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I love the idea of adding other options to the app - "I like this", "Let's remember this part for later", "I can't wait to revisit this", etc.<br/><br/>The green-yellow-red system sounds interesting, as well - putting up a bit of a "yellow light" when you're concerned about something could be a useful tool.

And these days I pass for a highly social, even entertaining human being. Guess role-playing games taught me something, in the long run. I would not, today, choose to play a role-playing game with 20-years-younger me: that wouldn't be much fun. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But, also seriously, some of the people I was playing with like 15 or 20 years ago were at least as socially challenged than me. Some of them grew out of it, some of them didn't. Most did, I think. But these days I'm playing with different people, from different backgrounds. I still have no idea whether role-playing games provided us with a <i>better</i> training ground for sociability than other social pursuits would have.<br/><br/>In hindsight, my teenage role-playing experiences weren't very functional on any account, nor especially fun. Crass and mean-sounding violations of player's personal boundaries indeed happened, between people who otherwise purported to be friends, and were then quickly written out and forgotten, in a sort of awkward mutual exploration of what behavior is or isn't acceptable to other human beings. If we hadn't done that, I doubt we would've learned much.<br/><br/>This is not why those games weren't much fun, though. Mostly, it was our awkward juvenile stumbling with everything, from session scheduling to creating storylines. Gaming as a regular pastime, despite being a social activity, mostly attracted people who were the least talented for it, myself included\u2026 Despite that, I clung to role-playing games stubbornly as my activity of choice, the one I self-identified with. At some point, it started being fun. I guess this happened roughly when I started playing with slightly older people, who had mastered their juvenile awkwardness already?<br/><br/>Regardless, I overcome most of my awkwardness as well, without even noticing at first, and got to play with more and more people. And, at some point, I realized that role-playing had become a fun activity, for real. No more just a fantasy I was invested with, but something I hugely enjoyed doing. Meanwhile - at which exact point in time is quite fuzzy - I have also become the kind of person who loves being around other people, period. Quite different from my old me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439360/#Comment_439360" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-12T16:52:54+00:00" title="October 12, 2014  4:52PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This intently social activity isn't for you: yeah, I guess not.</blockquote>I have a little bit of experience with this from the other side, and my experience indicates that content and system matter a lot.  That may sound presumptuous, and Corley is welcome to come remind me that game designers are not gods, but it's what I've seen recently.<br/><br/>I have a good friend who is an awesome roleplayer who generally shuns RPGs because they're too intensely social.  And then we play a light-hearted game about teenage robot pilots, using a ruleset with mechanics that render our choices into discreet, meaningful options, and boom, she's eager to play more.<br/><br/>I bet that if you started a thread asking for game suggestions tailored to particular comfort zones, it wouldn't be a waste of time.

There's still lots of gaming with a) light-hearted games, b) light-hearted people, c) sensitive people, d) children or older people (maybe!), e) people who you feel comfortable enough to speak to about this issue.<br/><br/>If all kinds of things trigger you and make playing not-fun, that's tough. I would advise only playing in games where the material is very safe, and/or with people you trust not to go there.<br/><br/>But it sounds like you're OK with (and even interested in) violence and sexuality, and probably some other heavier topics, too. Is it just sexual violence which triggers you? If it's that specific (and I don't know if it is; no need to reply in public, perhaps you just want to think it over yourself), that makes the problem much simpler: you just need to find a person (who will tell the others on your behalf) or a gaming group who you're willing to trust enough to say:<br/><br/>"Hey, I really like playing with you! I just want to make a request about content. Is it OK if we leave out sexual violence, at least whenever I'm present? It makes me uncomfortable."<br/><br/>It's not exactly shocking for a woman (or anyone, for that matter) to feel uncomfortable with such topics (I am too, for example, and would consider leaving a game if someone wanted to explore it in any kind of detail). I doubt it would require much more explanation than that.<br/><br/>If they press harder, say something like, "Look, I really don't want to discuss this. It's just not something I want to deal with - which includes talking about it in any detail right now. Are you OK with leaving it out of our gaming or not? It's important to me."<br/><br/>While some people might still not get the hint, I would think/hope that most reasonable adults would understand enough to know what to do at this point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439417/#Comment_439417" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-14T08:03:30+00:00" title="October 14, 2014  8:03AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Paul_T.<br/>It seemed like you kind of had bad luck with your gaming groups too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439913/#Comment_439913" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T18:26:26+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  6:26PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK so I haven't been posting here for a while.<br/>I've been playing though, I've been DMing LMoP and working on a campaign of my own that we might try when LMoP is over.

They don't know if the abuse is a part of the game and therefor let it go, even if it will hurt them mentally. This behavior of trying to let the topic pass increases if you don't have the typical safety net, for example if you don't play with your friends but instead strangers.<br/><br/>I'm now starting to question if the X-card really is a good thing, based on this and what <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> is saying. It feels like a patch that doesn't work. If the roleplaying game or session involves sensitive topics then it should be built on a good solid structure that creates a safety net. Having a safe word to break the activity isn't enough. A good thought, but to me a tool that doesn't work.<br/><br/>So here is another reason why I think it's so important to have roleplaying games helping out building a group consensus.

I am not convinced that attaining pre-play consensus on content is necessarily vital, always desirable, or even fully possible.  Among friends it is superseded by normal ad-hoc dialogue and softened by familiarity, and among strangers it is rendered moot by the fact that the artist whose work I'm viewing isn't me, and therefore doesn't reflect on me.  I am free to leave in the middle if I wish.  I'm free to righteously say "Fuck you, you said you wouldn't do that."  I am free to walk away thinking whatever I want about the artist and the work.<br/><br/><b>That said, however,</b> I would say that any game that trafficks in dark or psychologically-charged content but doesn't tell you to expect that right on the box (flyer, ad, handout, pitch, etc)... is either a badly-conceived plan or a deliberate attempt to be shockingly cruel.  Which is rather adolescent, no?<br/><br/>This is the reason we put ratings on movies and videogames.  And the more specific the rating system is, the more useful it is.  For instance, the letter "R" (restricted audiences) doesn't tell me much.  But if you say "No violence, moderate cursing and sexual situations" I can make a more informed decision about what you're offering.  And if you tell me what <i>kind</i> of sexual situations you're talking about, I can make a better decision still.  This goes for GMs as well as designers.  I see it not as a question of consensus, but more like truth in advertising: Put the ingredients on the label, let the buyer decide before buying.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439953/#Comment_439953" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T14:53:14+00:00" title="November  5, 2014  2:53PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">@GB_Steve</a> Fat Man Down is not a great example, since it was deliberately written as a critique of prevailing attitudes about player safety. <br/><br/>The X-Card does feel pretty "American", which makes sense - it was developed by an American to address problems he had encountered at primarily American tables.

Maybe. Maybe not, even if I knew the rules coming in.<br/><br/>But here's the thing that ties it back to the X-Card: I'm not comfortable <i>at all</i> with telling you the particulars of why this piece of media struck me so deeply. Because it would reveal certain particulars of my life that I'm frankly don't really want to broadcast all the time, even if they do tend to come out anyway. And if I were to encounter this at a con game? With a bunch of total strangers? Would I have to, AsIf, explain to everyone? Would I be not tough enough for the game, then? Would whoever ran the game need to be completely up front about every iteration of what could happen? And if they did, would the process of self-exclusion thus actually cause people to reveal stuff that they don't always want to talk about?<br/><br/>The X-card ain't perfect, but I'm not sure there's a better solution for the problem as framed above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439972/#Comment_439972" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T23:39:52+00:00" title="November  5, 2014 11:39PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If it doesn't work for your culture of play I hope you have something even better at hand, and I hope you share it!

However, in a culture where hiding real feelings is a norm, having to make them explicit feels really strange. We have had issues come up in games that made some people uncomfortable (which covers a whole gamut of emotional states) and generally they were resolved by a) ignoring them and hope they go away or b) talking about them in the group, either during or after the game. a) works OK, as long as it's not a recurring or serious issue, b) works OK as long as there's a willingness to compromise. Neither works all the time. The X-card may well be a reasonable way to approach these issues, but it almost feels more wrong than the issues it seeks to address (although, of course, it isn't).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439997/#Comment_439997" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-06T13:42:21+00:00" title="November  6, 2014  1:42PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in pretty much exactly the same boat as Steve.

You just tap or point to the card, and the group processes "nope" without needing to know why.  These usage instructions are <i>fundamental</i> to the card's intent; having a piece of paper with an X on it that spawns discussions about people's sensitive areas is <i>not</i> the same thing at all.<br/><br/>If you knew that already, then my apologies for over-explaining, but I'm failing to understand your particular objection.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19792/the-x-card-isnt-enough" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19792/the-x-card-isnt-enough" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19792/the-x-card-isnt-enough/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19792/the-x-card-isnt-enough/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19792/the-x-card-isnt-enough/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19792%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19792%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The X-card isn't enough - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19792/the-x-card-isnt-enough/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="The X-card isn't enough - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19792/the-x-card-isnt-enough/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Sorry, just noticed this direct question:if I were to encounter this at a con game?

     Sorry, just noticed this direct question:<blockquote>if I were to encounter this at a con game? With a bunch of total strangers? Would I have to, AsIf, explain to everyone? Would I be not tough enough for the game, then?</blockquote>If you choose to frame it as a matter of toughness then yeah I guess, but there's nothing weird about that: some people love gory slasher films, some don't etc.  Simply a matter of taste.  But no, of course you wouldn't be expected to explain your reasons.  What I'm proposing is the exact opposite.  I mean: If I'm presenting at a con, the game will be happening with or without you.  I'm saying the onus for honesty lies with the <i>presenter,</i> not with the audience, and disclosure happens prior to play.\n<blockquote>Would whoever ran the game need to be completely up front about every iteration of what could happen?</blockquote>Not in great detail (because spoilers), but yes in a general way.  Not unlike a movie rating or a genre description.  If you needed a little more detail before making your decision, you could ask me for it, one question at a time, and my generalities would become a little more specific (but still trying to avoid spoilers) until you have just enough information to say "ok I'll play" or "ok no thanks".\n<blockquote>And if they did, would the process of self-exclusion thus actually cause people to reveal stuff that they don't always want to talk about?</blockquote>At a con?  Certainly not.  I'm on a schedule after all, this stuff has to be handled effectively <i>and</i> efficiently.  My conscious concerns at that moment are about the game I will be running, not the reason for why a particular individual chooses not to play in it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WMSkyfall" title="WMSkyfall"><img alt="WMSkyfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WMSkyfall">WMSkyfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440005/#Comment_440005" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-06T22:22:40+00:00" title="November  6, 2014 10:22PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I hear you guys on drawing attention to the unwelcome, but part of the idea of the X-card is that you <i>don't</i> need to share how you feel.

If someone X-cards in the middle of the scene, how much of the scene is rolled back? The most recent obvious escalation? Several escalations? The entire scene? It may not be clear from context what aspect of the scene is being X-carded. I'm not sure how the group can clarify what to elide without asking for more information about what prompted the card play--or, at the very least, asking for more information about what elements of the fiction should be scrapped.<br/><br/>(I imagine I am asking this question because on some level I am prioritizing the fiction over ensuring that everyone at the table is comfortable with said fiction. I understand that the purpose of the X-card is to explicitly promote the opposite, but I'd like to be able to reconcile that with my goal to salvage as much of the fiction as possible from a bad situation.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440006/#Comment_440006" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-07T01:06:16+00:00" title="November  7, 2014  1:06AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2014 1:07AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My default is "undo the last sentence that was spoken".

That helps a lot, to just talk through fictionally about what might have happened.<br/><br/>(I've gotten much better at time management during convention scenarios so this rarely happens to me anymore.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440063/#Comment_440063" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-10T20:19:07+00:00" title="November 10, 2014  8:19PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah, you totally handled it well, and I wasn't implying any sort of criticism of you there, Jason\u2014I hope you didn't take it that way.
