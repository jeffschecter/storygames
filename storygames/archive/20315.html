I.e. a sacrifice is at least as likely to mean to give up your sense of taste and smell, as it might mean to kill a family member.<br/>(Probably the only "virtue" of this faction that's recognizable to us is that they value corrupting and distorting things.)<br/><br/>I gave him the choice between giving up something small + being bound to a big quest, or giving up something big + being bound to a small quest. He chose the latter.<br/><br/>Now I have to answer three questions:<br/>1. What big thing did he give up to gain his powers?<br/>2. What small thing does he have to do satisfy his patron?<br/>3. What are some good Dark Side / Light Side or Corruption or similar mechanics that I can crib? I'd especially like one where corruption isn't completly inevitable, where you can take steps to become less corrupted and you can get more corrupted. How is the one in Force &amp; Destiny for example?<br/><br/><br/>The ideas so far I have is the aforementioned giving up taste and smell -- this seems too small though, for a PC that is (for a real live human it would be huge, but it's almost like a -1 pt quirk in GURPS).<br/>And corrupting a tree, but not sure as a one-off or to do it several times (like "once a day for a month").<br/><br/>I'm gonna take a look in like GURPS and maybe Metamorphica or something but do you guys have suggestions for these three?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447807/#Comment_447807" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-09T20:50:48+00:00" title="August  9, 2015  8:50PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They give up Spatial Awareness, and may therefore no longer perceive distance and direction. They still see things normally and can witness things interacting with each other, except that from their perspective everything in their field of vision merely "is" without spatial relations; imagine things floating in neat rows all next to each other like combatants in a turn-based JRPG combat view, occasionally jumping out of line to do something to each other. In a tabletop game you get this effect trivially by simply listing everything a character witnesses as a list, without commenting upon spatial relations. "In the room there is a table, a chair, an orc, a treasure chest and two doors. The orc is sitting in the chair."<br/><br/>(Obviously this sacrifice is more significant in some situations than in others. I would personally interpret it so that the character can still <i>act upon</i> things they perceive correctly from the perspective of the external world, they just don't understand how long it takes or how difficult it is, given the distances involved. So the character can e.g. shoot at somebody with a bow, they just don't know how much of a distance penalty they're taking, or they can run to the city gate they see, they just don't know if it takes five seconds or five minutes or half an hour. Obviously all sorts of tactical maneuvers are right out in skirmish combat context, as those are mostly about spatial maneuvering.)<br/><br/>Incidentally one of the blessings their new patron gives them (or could even be quest reward for the quest) is "Spatz", a manner of Glitch sprite, or gremlin as the common folk call them. Spatz the gremlin familiar may help its master with ordinary life by e.g. fetching things the master sees (important in many everyday situations when you don't know whether something is right in front of you or on the other side of the room), partially off-setting their issues. Spatz is loyal to the Glitch, and unknown to the warlock, it was literally crafted out of the Spatial Awareness (thence the name) they sacrificed to become a warlock, thus being part of the character himself in a sense.<br/><br/>As for the minor quest, I suggest traveling to a Glitch sage living nearby (like, same country) and helping them out in the last stages of constructing a Portal Frame by doing a little bit of scavenger hunting (rat tails, particular type of rocks, other junk that pleases you - largely minor). The Portal Frame is basically a dimensional gate with appropriate flavouring, intended for sending sacrifices directly to the Glitch and bringing glitch force out into the world; it's nothing immediately setting-threatening, just something very useful for Glitch-committed magicians who can use it to e.g. recharge magic items and turn the surrounding countryside all glitchy as seasons turn and the glitch force pervades the environment. Something every big honch Glitch sage wants in their sanctum sanctorum, surely!<br/><br/>(The theoretical purpose in my suggestion is to make the quest something genuinely minor, but also interesting in its long-term consequences. Completing the Portal Frame will only be difficult if the warlock makes it so by e.g. bringing friends who object to the idea for some reason.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447808/#Comment_447808" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-09T20:50:57+00:00" title="August  9, 2015  8:50PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For corruption mechanics - you're doing some sort of D&amp;D rules chassis, right? My suggestion is that Glitch corruption could simply come in the form of <b>Glitch damage</b>, which is like ordinary damage, except that for every damage die a single point of the damage is permanent <b>Glitch Corruption</b>. The Corrupted hit point heals normally insofar as hit points go, but it remains Corrupted, which may be visible to the trained or not-so-trained eye as whatever sort of mutation Glitch corruption causes. A character who has more Corrupted hit points than ordinary ones left at a given time is influenced by the Glitch in everything they do, as if Charmed; a character who only has Corrupted hitpoints left (due to e.g. being in a fight) is momentarily in the control of Glitch, not acting of their own volition at all. Normal hit points are expended first in fights and such, naturally, unless the character is currently controlled by the Glitch, in which case it's vice versa, of course.<br/><br/>So you keep track of Corruption points, which are a subset of a character's hit points, and the more Corruption points they have, the likelier it is that they'll get temporarily Glitched whenever they lose part of their hit points. Furthermore, the character may suffer <b>Glitch Attacks</b> at times as the Glitch struggles for control of their body - standard fantasy corruption logic here. A Glitch Attack occurs whenever appropriate (there's a Glitch sage spell for it, or you're a Glitch warlock trying to act against Glitch interests, or you step on holy ground, or whatever), causes an appropriate saving throw, and upon a success the character takes 1d6 damage to their Corrupted HPs, while on a failure they take 1d6 damage to their "pure" HPs. Either way they get weakened as the supernatural forces wrack their body. Note that only characters with at least one current Corrupted HP are vulnerable to Glitch Attacks, so if a character's already injured in their Corrupted HP sufficiently, they may be temporarily immune to it.<br/><br/>(If you're fully on board with all of the above and don't mind a teeny complication, then what I would do is that I would have Glitch damage heal Corrupted hitpoints in preference of causing further damage. So say a 2nd level character has 8 HP in total, and 3 of them are Corrupt and 5 are pure, and they've taken damage such that they currently have 0 corrupt HP and 4 normal HP; 1d6 of Glitch damage comes sailing in, the roll is '4', so three points of that goes to super-charging the character's Corrupt hp back to 3, and the last point occurs as damage to their normal HP, bringing him down to 3 vs 3 and thus to the brink of being Charmed by the Glitch; I'd have them save vs. the Charm at this time if it mattered right this minute whether they're still in control of themselves. If this paragraph sounds like so much math-based gobbledygook, feel free to ignore it.)<br/><br/>OK, so we know how to track the degree of corruption, and what the corruption does - it Charms you, then enslaves you, and it can also fuck you up with Glitch Attacks as long as you have even just a single Corrupted HP. Next, how you get Glitch damage, which starts this process: interacting with the Glitch is injurious, so e.g. spending time near a Portal Frame (save or take one die of Glitch damage, only applicable to those without any Glitch corruption at all), being exposed to Glitch magic (a damage-causing Glitch magic spell is obviously Glitch damage), being hit by a Glitch monster, or doing sacrificial rites to the Glitch (causes a die of damage here and there, the size of the die depending on how proficient you're at it - Glitch sages take like 1d4, complete morons take 1d12) for example. As I mentioned in the first place, each die of Glitch damage not only causes injury, but it also leaves corrupts a single HP per damage die; a character may well die from a Glitch attack, but if they don't, they're corrupted at least a little bit.<br/><br/>As for how to get rid of the Glitch Corruption, I suggest that holy magic inimical to the Glitch can cure it, but using it triggers an immediate Glitch Attack if possible, so doing it with small spells is not very safe and easy; better eliminate all the corruption with a single spell, so as to minimize the time spent seizuring and potentially dying. I suppose that it would be logical for Cure spells to each heal a single point of Corrupted HP per a die of healing, symmetrically with the way Glitch damage dice cause a point of corruption per die. Would this be too easy, though? Depends on your goals, and the Glitch Attack thing can still make it tricky to heal corruption when each healing spell cast causes damage, too, to the corrupt wretch.<br/><br/>Once we've established the above ground-rules about what the corruption score is (it is a portion of the character's HP pool) and what it does (it influences your actions and the way you relate to Glitch and anti-Glitch magic), it's easy to add more specific moral precepts, if you feel like it, and say that these influence the Corruption score. You can make these measures either temporary (e.g. praying to cause damage specifically to your Corrupt HP; it weakens you in terms of total HP, but also reduces the strength of the Corruption temporarily, until the Corrupt HP heal back), exhausting yet permanent (as per above, each die of HP loss also converts a single point permanently either way), or direct and permanent (there could be e.g. a spell that outright corrupts a single HP, no need to take damage - powerful, and a different feel compared to the normal process that disrupts a body so). For example, if you wanted to say that a Glitch-corrupted character can forsake the Glitch by saving an innocent life (for a particularly black and white moral clausule), you could represent this in the corruption mechanics by saying that they lose all but one point of their corruption by doing this, or whatever.<br/><br/>Note the defining feature of my suggested corruption rules: by defining corruption as a function of hit points, I'm saying that higher-level characters are more difficult to corrupt (as well as possibly some character classes over others, if you have HP differences between classes) and that the exhaustion, desperation and other weakness represented by HP damage makes it especially opportune for Glitch to take over. There are several features here that imply that Glitch corruption would be a savage, injurious process that few 0th level characters even survive - they'll die instead of becoming corrupt Glitch monsters. If all this doesn't work for you, then obviously this HP-associated approach isn't the way to go regarding corruption mechanics. Fine-tuning is possible, of course; for instance, it would be easy to say that Glitch sages have some special resistance to Corruption (advantage on saves against Glitch, half damage on Glitch damage dice, whatever) despite their low-ish HP, if one wanted to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447812/#Comment_447812" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-10T00:10:31+00:00" title="August 10, 2015 12:10AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's stuff is excellent, of course.

The tone of the campaign is a bit like the film \u201dSpirited Away", which wasn't an influence (Hodgsons \u201dHouse on the Borderlands\u201d was) but that's how it's evolved and we like it.<br/><br/>For getting unglitched, Greater Restoration works, but at the expense of your warlock power (you need at least 1 glitch point).<br/><br/>Getting shot by unglitched peeps is good for you because they shoot you in the glitch too. But getting shot by glitch well they go straight for the normal hope (hp is hope, fatigue, breath, stamina etc in our campaign).<br/><br/>There are actually four numbers: current glp, current hp, max glp and max hp.<br/><br/>That means I have to decide for all four what causes them to change.<br/>You need at least a max glp of 1 to use warlock powers.<br/><br/>Obeying the glitch<br/>Going against the glitch<br/><br/>How do those two affect the numbers reasonably?<br/>The party might want to fight quite a bit against \u201dlesser" glitch beings because that's what dungeons consist of.<br/>The glitch's goal is to corrupt and distort nature and civilization (it's a three way war between those three sides).<br/><br/>How does movement within that triangle affect your glitch status? For example, disobeying your patron's order in favor of helping nature?<br/><br/>I guess I'm most unclear about: does obeying glitch corrupt you, or does disobeying glitch corrupt you?<br/><br/>The party has seen those who've left glitch cults been corrupted and even die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447823/#Comment_447823" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-10T05:36:29+00:00" title="August 10, 2015  5:36AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh and of course all of the cursing and possessing etc creatures I have, they transmute hp into glitch                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447824/#Comment_447824" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-10T05:47:32+00:00" title="August 10, 2015  5:47AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2015 6:56AM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the house rules document I posted on the campaign website:<br/><br/>DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU ARE PLAYING ARCANE CASTER<br/><br/><br/><br/>Warlocks made a deal with the glitch.<br/>Sorcerers got glitched by accident.<br/>Wizards (and EK/AT) found documents in the glitch world and figured out how to cast from them.<br/><br/>Arcane casters, their HP is divided into Hope and Glitch.

Like, you could spend a night in prayer to remove a single corruption point prior to an important day, or you could spend two weeks of downtime living the Tao to get another point off, and so on. Hone that supernatural edge until you're just sufficiently corrupt for your purpose.<br/><br/>Speaking of which: if it starts to feel that the difference between 0 and 1 points of corruption is too stark (loss of magic), you could pace it out a bit. For example, you could require that casting a level N spell demands a corruption score of N, so a character with just one point of corruption gets to only cast 1st level spells. It's still not a huge number of points you need to cast your most powerful spells, but at least it's more than just one point, which seems unnecessarily minor for an accomplished magician.<br/><br/>For even more of a corruption demand, you could also demand more points for spells per day, so if you have N spells per day, you also need to have N corruption to cast your entire allotment. Off-hand, without looking at 5th edition rules details, combining these two might come close to encouraging a magician to succumb to the dark side for powerz.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448012/#Comment_448012" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-17T21:56:17+00:00" title="August 17, 2015  9:56PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Speaking of which: if it starts to feel that the difference between 0 and 1 points of corruption is too stark (loss of magic)</blockquote>\nSo far, that part feels perfect.
