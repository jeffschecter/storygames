They often say that if someone only controls a main character - like a player in traditional RPGs - then they have virtually no power over story.  i.e. They picture that the GM always has full control over the story in a traditional RPG.  <br/><i><b>EDIT:</b> and further that the one narrating out-of-character has control in a non-traditional RPG.</i><br/><br/>On the other hand, there are people (2) who see many (<i>but not all</i>) stories as being driven strongly by the personality, wishes, and choices of the main characters.  They think that for some stories, even if there is a traditional setup in that the GM controls the NPCs and rules over consequences, the players are the ones who direct the story.  <br/><i><b>EDIT:</b> These people do think that stories driven by out-of-character narration are possible, they just can picture other kinds of stories as well.</i><br/><br/>I'm less concerned about what to call these - though terms would be fine.

The players then insert themselves into the situation (this is an area where in my own gaming community the power has moved gradually from the GM to a more shared distribution between the GM and the players with the concept of the Session 0).  Still, there is no story until the players start doing stuff.  [Well there would be story, as the NPCs and the setting would continue on, but none of the players (including the GM) would care.]  So for all fun purposes, the story starts as soon as the players starting poking around in the situation.  As they tend to be the protagonists, their actions will have the most impact driving the story, though the reaction of the NPCs and the setting (as controlled by the GM, whose power, though, is still constrained by the rules system, the accepted tenets of the setting and some adherence to internal logic).<br/><br/>There are several areas, though, where this kind of structure is allowed to break down a bit and players can poke around into the setting and even NPCs.  First, there are systems that have rules that allow for this in a limited fashion, allowing players to manifest useful items or people at the right time or letting them narrate NPC reactions.  <br/><br/>Another, non-rules phenomenon that is also acceptable is when we zoom out.  This can happen at the end of a campaign or between scenarios.  Here, often, players will narrate a big picture thing of what happens to their character and the world around them.<br/><br/>I have played many games with a much greater emphasis on shared narrative control and I do enjoy them.  But the reason I don't consider that my go-to playing style is that they make me feel removed from the shared imaginary space.  I tend to not get immersed.  It's the constraints of the world and the reaction of the NPCs outside of my control that makes the world seem real to me (assuming a good GM here) and that is a big part of what I look for in my RPG fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319032/#Comment_319032" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T07:05:44+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  7:05AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>I don't identify with either assertion.

My one-shot of Apocalypse World didn't have this, but it might have been atypical.  So I'm not sure about commenting on these.  <br/><br/>In my experience, a lot of story games don't actually focus on having PC actions directly shape the narrative, but instead give players out-of-character power to narrate things.  A Thousand and One Nights is a good example.  Usually it's the person whose story turn it is to narrate that shapes the story, even though other players have characters to play.  It's still great fun and an excellent design, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319041/#Comment_319041" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T07:52:49+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  7:52AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>(1) associate power over story solely with out-of-character narration.  <br/>(2) who see many (<i>but not all</i>) stories as being driven strongly by the personality, wishes, and choices of the main characters.</blockquote>\nI am a special snowflake!

And that these stories are not necessarily shared among everyone at the table.<br/><br/>I'll give an example:  I was playing in a Vampire game some years back, in which pretty much everyone in our group would agree that the story was, in broad strokes, about a coterie of vampires who climbed up the local power ladder over the crushed dreams of their enemies.  Plots were usually of the "our influence here is being undermined, time to strike back!" variety, with occasional forays into investigation ("where can we find this person?") and some very active, player-character-driven arcs ("I will have revenge on my sire!").  How much that story was directed by the GM varied from scene to scene; sometimes the NPCs were driving the action and the PCs were reacting to it, sometimes vice versa.  Sometimes the GM would be very aggressive about keeping up the pace of the game, other times he'd sit back and let the players kibbitz about things.  So that covers <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>But there was also at least one other story going on that table: a secret one I was telling to myself about my character.  It was one of those games where there were maybe just a bit too many plot threads flying around, meaning that the party was constantly splitting up and going off to do things on their own, and consequently there wasn't a lot of screen time available to deal with small/intimate/personal issues.  I <i>like</i> dealing with those small issues, for me that's where a lot of the fun of gaming lives.  If there's no room for it in the story of the game, that doesn't (and didn't) keep me from having it anyway:  I just made it almost entirely internal to the character.  In scenes where my PC wasn't called upon to do all that much, I would kind of drift off into my own head for a bit and figure out where his personal story was going.  I'd set private goals and work towards them, not always cluing the GM in on what I was doing.  Basically, if it wasn't relevant to the main story of the game and didn't involve at least two other characters, I didn't want to steal spotlight time from anyone else to handle it: I could chase that story on my own time, in my own head, maybe in side conversations with another PC from time to time.  I didn't need an audience, because the whole point was that I was doing this to entertain <i>myself</i>.  What happened in that secret story influenced what happened in the main story, in the sense that it deeply affected the decisions my PC would make and what actions he would advocate to the rest of the coterie...but it wasn't <i>part</i> of the main story.  It was basically an iceberg in the game's ocean: the rest of the table could see maybe 10% of it and could account for it when navigating, but most of it was underneath the surface and the only way they were going to find out about the rest was if they crashed into it, and that wasn't anyone's preferred outcome.<br/><br/>I suspect I'm not the only one in our group who does this.  It seems to be more true for the players who skew more towards the introverted end of things (maybe because they're already inclined to not need an audience to be satisfied?), but to some extent I think everyone is telling their own little private stories via internal narration, and using them to inform how they contribute to the big consensual story of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319110/#Comment_319110" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T11:10:32+00:00" title="April  6, 2011 11:10AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My problem with a lot of the "traditional" play i've been involved with over the years has been that while <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is what may be happening in the game the main characters who are creating the story are NPC's and the decisions and important events are taking place off-screen.

A given player (using that term in its widest sense) may be aware of a vast range of models but have a strong preference for a particular one. I wasn't sure the OP made that distinction. Edit: I somehow didn't take your edits on board. Sorry John.<br/><br/>That aside, traditional sandbox play is an example of 2 isn't it? The GM creates the world but having done so is effectively reactive. The players determine, via their characters and through no other mechanical interface, what their characters do and those choices drive play.<br/><br/>The players here are active and the GM reactive, but players only control their characters and the GM controls everything else. That's the model of sandbox play. Opinions vary on how widespread it is, and was, and all I can say on that is that it exists and is clearly a valid model of play given those who play that way enjoy it.<br/><br/>In terms of identification 2 is my preference regardless of whether I play or GM. It's not a "nothing else is fun" preference, but it is a preference of long standing and which has been tested by trying other models (which were mostly fun, but not ultimately as satisfying for me personally). As GM I enjoy seeing what the characters do and reacting to it. As a player I enjoy exploring a world that I don't personally create save through my actions within that world.<br/><br/>What I don't enjoy is what Vernon describes. There are I understand players who love that, but I'm not among them (and clearly nor is he). That said, I do enjoy mysteries which necessarily on a GM controls the world players the characters model have to work largely as Vernon describes. What can I say?

If you want "story" story, the sort you'd get in a book or tv program, you might be better off looking at a story game because a sandbox game isn't aiming at that outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319119/#Comment_319119" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T11:40:43+00:00" title="April  6, 2011 11:40AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>My problem with a lot of the "traditional" play i've been involved with over the years has been that while <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is what may be happening in the game the main characters who are creating the story are NPC's and the decisions and important events are taking place off-screen.

This sounds like the GMs you are playing with aren't quite railroading, but also aren't, for whatever reasons, allowing the players to be involved in the central role of the action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319120/#Comment_319120" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T11:45:31+00:00" title="April  6, 2011 11:45AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had Vernon's experience Walker. Usually I think it happens when the GM has a "story" story in mind and sees the players as participants in it rather than co-creators.<br/><br/>Which if that's how the players see themselves, and plenty do, can work well. If the players want more agency though (which as John's enquiry notes is unrelated to who has narrative power) then it's deeply frustrating.<br/><br/>When I play I want agency. I don't play just to see the GM's vision unfold. I don't really enjoy that (I mean, sometimes I do and I've played in kickass games like that at cons, but week in week out it's not my thing). I want my agency though expressed through the vehicle of character, not as a direct intervention in the world.<br/><br/>As you say, it needn't be railroading. It could just be that the GM has this cool world and part of that is cool people and the PCs sadly ain't those people. Again, that can work but it can also be deeply frustrating even if the players aren't railroaded (though there'll probably be some railroading or illusionism somewhere along the way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319125/#Comment_319125" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T11:53:52+00:00" title="April  6, 2011 11:53AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the flip side, you can also have campaigns where the PCs are front and center and totally the most important players, but the players are still pretty much without agency.<br/><br/>If I had to choose between the lesser of two evils, that is being secondary to the story but being free to do what I wanted versus being primary but lacking agency, I'd pick the former.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319152/#Comment_319152" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T13:34:12+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  1:34PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I tend to think of the process of play as an iterative process running through Setup-&gt;Execute-&gt;Resolve.  I tend to be at my MOST high-level everyone authors during the Setup phase and at my most "immersive" character-only during the Execute phase.  During the resolve phase I prefer that to be handled as much by system as possible and for no one person to ever be fully in control.<br/><br/>I see that process as semi-fractal in that the whole game can be thought of as going through this process, as can individual scenes as can the stages of die/card driven resolution.<br/><br/>So, during character creation I'm all about setting up external stuff to my character.  "Man, I totally think my wife hates me because she doesn't know I hut monsters at night.  In fact, she thinks I'm having an affair."  But during play, (i.e. game level execution) I want someone else to be responsible for bringing that to life.  I don't want to have to play me AND my wife.<br/><br/>Similarly, when setting up scenes I'm all for stuff like, "Hey I think it would be great if you and ran into the bar right as NPC mona walks in the door."  But once we hit the "GO" button then everyone "just plays".  I hate story-boarding scenes beyond the initial "frame."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319153/#Comment_319153" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T13:38:25+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  1:38PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I don't buy into this dichotomy. To me they are different methods, but both can used in the service of the same end.<br/><br/>What's more important to me is: are the choices and the actions of the players (whether solely through their characters, or not) major determiners in the outcome of play (the "story")? <br/><br/>The way a given group is playing a game, in combination with the game's rules, answers this question with a "yes", a "no", or a "sometimes".<br/><br/>Using "out-of-character" narration can provide significant impact on the outcome of play. (Especially given rules that support that, or a group that does the same.)<br/><br/>Character actions and choices can also provide significant impact on the outcome of play. (Especially given rules that support that, or a group that does the same.)<br/><br/>The important thing is that those choices are not overridden by other players: that they impact what's going on in some significant way.<br/><br/>I want my choices to be meaningful: to change the outcome in some significant way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319186/#Comment_319186" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T15:23:22+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  3:23PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i am for option 3<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> THE GAME is in primary control over how the story develops and progresses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
