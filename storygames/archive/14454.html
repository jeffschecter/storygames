It's revived my thinking about cartoon type slapstick in RPGs, and I've been wondering how to do it better. Toon was the first RPG I ever owned, and I had a lot of fun with it back in middle school, but when I pulled it out again more recently the whole time I was thinking "Cartoon characters don't have hit points!" That cartoon characters Fall Down instead of dying makes perfect sense, but tracking hit points until it happens is rather... odd. Maid RPG's Stress Explosions are another great take on it, since the "damage" leads to the character's behavior changing instead of them being incapacitated.<br/><br/>Working on a comedy-oriented AW hack has been really interesting too, since I keep ending up writing moves with "...and you look stupid in front of everyone" and such in them. AW moves' penchant for spitting out narrative consequences for everything seems to lend itself to cartoon physics, since they're made of a narrative logic of bright colors, and unusually far-removed from a "physics-based" approach.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328990/#Comment_328990" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T10:02:20+00:00" title="June 10, 2011 10:02AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see the countdown clocks as an interesting pacing mechanism for farce style situations where everything just gets crazier and crazier until things are resolved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328993/#Comment_328993" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T10:12:56+00:00" title="June 10, 2011 10:12AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience is from my own stuff, so I'll talk about that.  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/amagigames/the-cog-wars" rel="nofollow">The Cog Wars</a> typically plays as cartoon, with breaks into some very serious shit.<br/><br/>From that, I can say that being able to set any stakes on conflict, have anything be the opposition, and throw down any condition as an "injury", means that you can have totally on-spec conflicts about blatantly ridiculous things; you can have a bake-off and it's just as solid as a fight.

I was thinking about resurrecting Teenagers From Outer Space for use as a more generic anime comedy game, but decided instead to hack octaNe. It's actually working well so far, and I really need to update the <a href="http://gremlinlegions.blogspot.com/2011/05/little-something-im-fiddling-with.html" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> I wrote detailing my thoughts on it so far (I had a momentary epiphany when I realized that Stuff shouldn't give bonus dice, but instead are details that can be brought into play when spending Plot Points...I don't know why I never realized that before with octaNe...).<br/>As I've been working on this hack called <b>aNtics</b>, I've been making sample characters left and right, based on classic characters from both American cartoons and Japanese anime, and its worked pretty well in capturing the feel. Everything from Bugs Bunny, the Warner Bros (and their sister Dot), the Tick, Sgt. Keroro, Doraemon, Lupin the 3rd and gang, even Haruhara Haruko!<br/>Of course, I haven't had a chance to playtest it, since my usual gaming friends dislike games centered around comedy (when comedy erupts in otherwise serious games, they're fine with that...). I might give it a shot at the next GoPlayPDX West in July (since I'm dead-set on running Ben Lehman's HQRPG this month), since they seem like a generally cheery and wacky crowd.<br/><br/>...uh, I forgot where I was going with this.<br/>But yeah, I'd be interested in seeing how AW can be hacked for comedy and cartoony wackiness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329018/#Comment_329018" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T12:08:01+00:00" title="June 10, 2011 12:08PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would think that the Three Stooges would feature heavily in your research when it comes to slapstick.

Basically, people tend to unconsciously use "how easy is it to remember X?" to answer the question "how common is X?". Since entertainment media are designed to produce vivid and engaging moments (rather than <i>uniform</i> vividness) it might be easy to only use those "high points" as a basis for emulating a genre when the "low points" might be just as important for delivering the overall effect. In humor, for example, the setup does a lot of work to make a joke succeed, but the impact comes at the punchline. That might lead us to overestimate the time spent on punchline-like payoff moments and underestimate how much setup needs to be done. I haven't really tested this theory, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts" title="DorkThoughts"><img alt="DorkThoughts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts">DorkThoughts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329024/#Comment_329024" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T13:14:31+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  1:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Dan">@Dan</a><br/><br/>Yes, the setup portion is so essential to making jokes really work.

You had so many tables for Boggles and other weird effects that you could introduce when things went wrong. I always had fun of thinking of strange things that could happen when the characters failed. It was essentially "What would happen in a cartoon if they failed? Well, do it!"<br/>There were characters falling down nigh-endless flights of stairs (taking 1D6+1 Bumpity-bumpity-bumpity-bumpity damage), getting balloons shoved on their heads so their breathing caused it to inflate and float into the stratosphere, being duped by rather talentless con-artists into purchasing that highly overpriced statue that just happens to be the Animator's stolen property...all of this resulting from a single failure and someone thinks it'd be funny.<br/>If anything, I think Toon's failing came from its over-dependence on points.

Comedy seems to be my default: when I play most games, I have to work to keep the tone serious and not be laughing all the time. Even though they're not necessarily intended to be comedy - Fiasco, Geiger Counter, Microscope. I think it helps to not bill the game as a comedy - you don't want the players to come in expecting to laugh. Aaron Sorkin shows are usually billed as dramas but they're usually also very funny.

I'm here.<br/><br/>Lemme talk about <i>Toon!</i> first. When I got it, I fell in love with it, I laughed my ass off reading it. When I played it, it just... wasn't very funny.<br/><br/>Here's the thing: the <i>book</i> is funny. The <i>rules</i> are funny (1d6+1 bumpity-bumpity-bump damage? Hi-larious). The random tables are a fuckin' riot. The problem is, none of this actually prompts you and your friends <i>to say funny things</i>.<br/><br/>This is because the system is basically GURPS. As we all know, GURPS doesn't actually, like, y'know, <i>do</i> anything. It's kind of a little robot sidekick that you turn to while playing and say, "Hey, does this work?" and it goes, "Beep boopboop beep, affirmative," and you continue based on that. The system itself provides no <i>engine of play</i>; that's all up to the group.<br/><br/>To be fair, <i>Toon!</i> makes a valiant (and, for its time, innovative) attempt with its Plot Points (and contingent bits of system). Unfortunately, the Plot Point system is kinda vague and fluffy, too dependent on GM fiat, and no two groups use it the same way.<br/><br/>So, anyway. <i>Super Action Now!</i> and <i>Knuckleheads</i> are both my own games, so I'm biased about them, but they are great. They're both based around the idea that a comedy game isn't one that's funny to read (although SAN! is) or one that has rules that are funny, but one that prompts you to say funny things.<br/><br/>SAN! is a really crazy gonzo absurd game. The stuff that comes out of it is comparable to Naked Gun, Chowder, and some of the weirder episodes of Spongebob Squarepants. What happens is, everyone makes up weird characters (actually, they don't even have to all be weird; it turns out straightmen work just fine), then you cook up a starting situation that puts them at odds somehow, and let them try to resolve it. Unpredictable stuff is injected into the game via players' whims and a from-the-hat mechanic (which I have found superior to Toon!'s tables because, once you've read the tables, they kinda lose their magic for this purpose because you end up pre-imagining what would happen if you ever rolled bla-bla-blah), and things gradually escalate until they resolve (often by the world exploding, but not always). The motor of the game is the characters trying to achieve their agendas in the face of increasingly absurd obstacles, because we all identify with adversity to our endeavors, and blowing it up big, exaggerated, and absurd enables us to laugh at it in order to cope with the horror of our daily lives. The moral is, "Life's a bitch, then you get run over by a flying ice cream truck."<br/><br/>The system is really really clever but not in the ways it seems to be. I wish that I had an up-to-date draft (read: one that reflects how I actually run the game), but unfortunately all I've got is <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/SUPER_ACTION_NOW_3.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. I'm not sure how to summarize how it works...<br/>...Here's some important bits, though. Every character has a "Drive" that they try to fulfill. If you ignore this Drive, the character pretty much powers down and your ability to contribute is severely lessened. It's useful both A.) to remind players that they need to, like, y'know, <i>play</i> their characters as <i>at least</i> two-dimensional, not just as pawns, and B.) to bait another player into doing something stupid but funny.<br/><br/>There's a player (not character) resource called TILT! that is used to fuck with the fiction in various ways. You gain TILT! when your contributions to the game make people laugh. If you run out, your ability to contribute is seriously hampered. It's a punishment (not reward) mechanic that reinforces everyone being on the same page about what is funny.<br/><br/>The resolution mechanics seem really stupid, and for a long time I thought they were, just a sort of "resolve it and get out of the way" (aside from the fact that rolling literal handfuls of dice is fun by itself) thing, but I've come to realize that I made them better than I thought. You have Dogs-esque player-written traits, and you can invoke as many of them as you can in order to maximize your chances of success. This leads to people coming up with totally absurd, crazy-ass, and (most importantly) <i>funny</i> plans of action so that they can involve as many traits as possible. The damage mechanic is also great: there is no real "damage," there is only Inconvenience. Anything bad that can happen (including but not limited to being dead) is just Inconvenience, and you have to try to figure out how to get rid of it. That leads to people thinking up some very funny stuff as well.<br/><br/><i>Knuckleheads</i> is a game that I wrote in response to our own TomasHVN saying that SAN! was a stupid game. It's basically a stripped-down, highly streamlined version of SAN! that focuses on classic slapstick of the Three Stooges and Laurel &amp; Hardy variety. The core of it is basically the same, just more specific: <blockquote>Regular Joe protagonists that the audience can easily identify with, engaging in some manner of objective enterprise, in the face of increasingly absurd obstacles and/or opposition in the form of an antagonist who is usually an authority figure and has a personal grudge against the protagonists. These hassles lead to humorous setbacks and increasingly unlikely attempts to surmount them, along with a healthy dose of mounting frustration for the protagonists\u2014often prompting absurd violence between them. </blockquote>\nThe original version <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7531&amp;page=1#Item_27" rel="nofollow">appears here</a>. There's a <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/118" rel="nofollow">for-sale version</a>, but it's basically the same with just a few little tweaks and better layout.<br/><br/>So, anyway. What it's about is making sure the system presents situations that prompt responses from the players that are funny. There's different kinds of funny, which call for different kinds of situations. You saw what I think slapstick is about a couple paragraphs up. If that doesn't match up with what you mean by slapstick then of course we need to talk about what slapstick means to you; I can work with other kinds of humor. I mean, I've also got a game based on the movie <i>Coffee &amp; Cigarettes</i> and am working on one that's a sitcom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329891/#Comment_329891" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T08:33:29+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  8:33AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RichD</cite>farce style situations where everything just gets crazier and crazier until things are resolved</blockquote>\nThat is a very accurate description of <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=92348" rel="nofollow">Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
