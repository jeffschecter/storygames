I accepted the GM role, and the rest were Pooka (who normally GMs and also had a copy of BS), Pooka's wife Louise, and their two friends Liz and Fraggle.<br/><br/>New game and a new group of local players, one which I actually met via a post about Polaris on my blog. So this was the first time I met all of them (except Pooka, who I met briefly the week before over a cup of coffee).<br/><br/>Three of the group are female players, which is absolutely awesome, and it does make a difference.<br/><br/>Pooka recorded the session and split it into two parts. Most of the first part is a decription of the game and game mechanics. So, if you want to skip to the play itself go to around 52:30 minutes into part 1.<br/><a href="http://pooka235.blogspot.com/2007/09/bliss-stage-ignition-stage-final-act.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pooka235.blogspot.com/2007/09/bliss-stage-ignition-stage-final-act.html</a><br/><br/>And please excuse my accent. It's pretty horrible.<br/><br/>Per                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
