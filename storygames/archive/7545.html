Everything else is handled by GM fiat (yay, GM fiat!) because, frankly, it <i>does not matter</i> whether your character is skilled enough to climb the wall, unless there's somebody there saying "Oh, you're a loser, there's no way you'll get to the top of that wall!"<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the thing:  If I spring that on indie-familiar audiences, the system gets used instantly ... people go <i>looking</i> for opportunities to create an argument and put down some cards and force others to respond.  Engaging the system is part of their fun in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I spring it on non-gamer audiences, the system gets used only when I insist that the system gets used.  Otherwise (in my limited experience) people argue in character, in a way that is unlikely to ever produce any resolution, and while they get increasingly frustrated at the impasse they don't think to go to the system to finish things.  As they get more and more deeply into the fictional argument, the idea of going to system for the ending becomes more and more awkward.  Plus, frankly:  Under the rules they have a chance of winning and a chance of losing ... in an open argument (as the internet so frequently proves) they can believe themselves to have a chance of winning, and <i>know</i> that they never have a chance to lose, so long as they refuse to accept the points of their opponent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that, in essence, the skill of going to conflict resolution has been built up by oral tradition, not codified in very many rules instances.  "Say Yes or roll the dice," for instance, as well as "You two:  Duel of Wits or shut the **** up!" are examples of play advice that directs people toward using the system, rather than system rules that require rules adjudication.  So it works for people who want to use the rules, but doesn't aid the same behavior in people who just want to win the argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to short-circuit that, so that even people who haven't been part of this oral tradition get the experience of going to the rules in order to resolve a conflict.  As such, I'd like to try to figure out some cue that will let people know that they are <b>required</b> to use the rules system if they want to take certain fictional actions (in exactly the way that a D&amp;D; player who wants his character to slice off an orc's head knows that he needs to roll dice for that).<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don't know where that breaking point is, or how to phrase it.  I don't think it's merely "In order to disagree with something someone said, you must play a card," because that would prevent people from having "Who would win in a Superman vs. Hulk fight?" arguments where everybody knows that they don't actually want anything resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it best to put it as "When you want X, play a card"?  I worry that people will try to achieve X without resorting to the rules.  I'd be happier with "You <i>may not</i> do X unless you play a card," I'm just not sure what that X would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle help?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167494/#Comment_167494" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T08:09:58+00:00" title="September  7, 2008  8:09AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, are you looking for a procedural cue, a physical cue, what?<br><br>One thing I like about Zombie Cinema - when you start a potential conflict, you slap down your die.

Like this: at the beginning of the conversation, roll, and bank your successes. Over the course of the conversation, spend your banked successes 1 by 1 to [list of options].<br/><br/>Another straightforward example: whoever takes the conversation to the rules first, gets +1 to the resolution. Or, gets 1xp, goes onto the owe list, gets to set up the next scene, gets to heal 1hp damage. (edit: Carl beat me to it!)<br/><br/>A rule I considered for another game: if someone's telling you to do something, and you say no a third time, it's time to roll dice. If you're having an argument and you repeat the same point a third time, it's time to roll dice.<br/><br/>You could do it like: if your fellow argumenter calls you out for having repeated an argument, go to cards, and she gets x bonus.<br/><br/>You could do it like: at the beginning of any conversation, you get cards face down. If anyone at the table says to, turn the cards up and resolve. If you get to the end of the conversation without having gone to cards, shuffle those cards back into the deck. (The face-down cards serve as a reminder to everyone, create the expectation that they'll be used.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167691/#Comment_167691" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T07:53:50+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  7:53AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given that it's so high school, I'm tempted to say "If someone's insisting on something that matters, you need to play a card before you can disagree even a <i>first</i> time."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "things that matter" line might be a real tripping point, or it might be a fruitful-void sort of thing ("Dude, you're not even playing a CARD when you say that the Hulk can't fly?

So, to use the game we played at GenCon as an example, if Damien and Jessie were quibbling about whether neon orange was emo or not, that probably wouldn't matter. But if Damien and Jessie were arguing about whether JESSIE HERSELF was emo, that sure as hell would matter. Alternately, I could also see the argument shifting from a stupid fight about a color (doesn't matter) to Jessie laying down a card and saying 'your criticism of my color choice means you think that *I'M* not emo', after which it should go to cards.<br/><br/>You'll probably get variance from group to group on where the line gets drawn - does this matter? Does it not? But I don't see that as problematic.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167698/#Comment_167698" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T08:42:52+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  8:42AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>The "things that matter" line might be a real tripping point, or it might be a fruitful-void sort of thing</blockquote>\nMake it a requirement to play a card when you disagree on anything, not just things that matter.

Definitely needs a catch phrase/motto like "say yes or roll the dice." I think that sometimes these kinds of systems get unused simply because people forget. Make it easy to remember, no?<br/>\n2) Mitigate mechanical risk. so for instance, if you lose an argument, maybe you get an extra card to play next round that represents the other guys feeling guilty for shooting you down? Something loike that, that means that no one ever really loses...<br/>\n3) Mitigate Social Risk. Make it fun/exciting/whatever to use the mechanic. So that when people are RPing a total high school drama queen they can make a crack about bring the drama, "in card form" or something. And sort of demonstrate that they, themselves, are not total drama queens, right?<br/>\n  I dunno if any of these ideas fit your design, or even answers your questions, but I hope they do.<br/>\n  Either way, good luck man!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167734/#Comment_167734" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T10:39:49+00:00" title="September  8, 2008 10:39AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So now I'm wondering whether the person who <i>insists</i> on something or the person who <i>disputes</i> something should be the one to first play a card.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike, if it were the insister, if I come up and say "Oh man!  I <b>hate</b> Ms. Coulton!  She's totally got it in for me, she's going to flunk me whatever I do!" then I should play a card ("Cynical," perhaps).  Then, if nobody wants to stick up for a teacher (i.e. we don't have anyone playing the "Obedient" persona) everyone nods and says "Too true, man!  Too true!" and we move on.  If somebody wants to disagree then they need to jump in on the card.  But if nobody disagreed ... I don't really feel like I'd be disappointed.  I get to insist on how I think things are, and eveyone agrees with (or at least doesn't <i>disagree</i> with) my take on things.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, getting rid of cards helps free up room in your hand, so it's actually a pretty good thing:  particularly getting rid of the low-value cards that are best as opening plays to potential arguments.  So, unless you're <i>really</i> short on card, being "forced" to play the opening card isn't actually all that big a deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHrm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
