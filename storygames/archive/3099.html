Since the Edinburgh University Student's Union bar was nearby, there was much cheap beer, and we consequently made the decision to get off our faces.<br/><br/>The resulting game experience was much enhanced by our being trashed. I played a small hovering robot who communicated only by oscilloscope. Matt Machell, who sat next to me, played the engineer, and understood every twiddle of my oscilloscope (which I represented by waving my finger up and down).<br/><br/>The amusement factor was, I feel, greater due to our being bolloxed. I don't think we finished the game, and I believe we may have played Jungle Speed afterwards, which was a bad idea).<br/><br/>Would anyone else like to share positive game experiences while in a wankered state?<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>P.S. If you think that being plastered is antithetical to good storytelling, that's great! We agree to disagree and I'll buy you a beer sometime.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70860/#Comment_70860" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T12:00:16+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 12:00PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Graham, that's an impressive array of euphemisms for 'drunk'.

The game was about the Thieves Guild going on strike and thus the nasty areas of Ankh Morpork became a lot nicer and the characters local went from being a dirty smelly hole to being a 'theme' pub with candles in wine bottles and scampi in a basket etc. The locals decided to take matters into their own hands and deal with the cause of the strike and get the thieves stealing again. We thought it was appropriate to run the game in the Students Union Bar. Well, not in, more at. About two feet away from it. Naturally, things were going to get very messy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember two things distinctly. One was a player who was not a regular imbiber of beer-based products but was playing the only known priest of the Lemming God standing up in the middle of the bar and calling down a 'Rain of Lemmings' on one of the NPCs -VERY- loudly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second was another player who was playing an elderly (ahem) seamstress, who was addicted to Creme de Menthe. By the middle of the game he was adamant that he should be drinking Creme de Menthe for method-gaming. The bar did not have any. SHOCK! The downstairs bar might have had some ... but the conference earlier in the week had drank them dry. HORROR!! Not to be put off, he then ran around everywhere that someone would listen to him, desperately seeking Creme De Menthe, only to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't quite remember how it finished, but it was a very fun session of wholesale silliness.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70903/#Comment_70903" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T14:30:14+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  2:30PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I wish I had a story to contribute!</blockquote>\nI recall you saying something about how appropriate it was that during the late-night Lacuna game I ran for you, I would talk, pause, take a drink from my flask, and continue talking.

(MACDETH!)  I feel wrong running Unknown Armies without a drink in my hand.  Booze helps liberate the tongue and mind -- great for story writing, great for story telling.  I can't say we got plastered (as it takes a lot for me these days), but I do enjoy running or playing in games when my mind's properly...lubricated.<br><br>On the other hand: Graham, I quite disagree with you.
