They are intended mostly for one-shot, introductory or convention play, but are also suitable for a longer-term game, depending the groups level of investment in the material.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt The Crossroads of Sanctuary and Salvation takes place in 1947 the town of Sanctuary, the picture-perfect model for small town living in the American South. The Mayor will tell you they call it Sanctuary because folks know how to keep their problems behind closed doors. All of that changed one humid summer day when a mysterious traveling salesman named Quentin Drake came to town. He always has what you need. Don\u2019t worry about the cost; you needn\u2019t always pay in cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow will you cope with that which threatens your way of life?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis dark mid-century America setting was written by the erudite Jesse Burneko. He developed a nice twist on Secret-setting derived from Spione that's pretty neat, in addition to writing up one of those "ew, so creepy!" kind of settings. Thank Jesse!<br/>\n<br/>\nArt, as always, by Jennifer Rodgers.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can download the 2-page PDF <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://hamsterprophetproductions.com/downloads/Annalise/Annalise_Sanctuary.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> direct, or <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=7883" rel="nofollow">here</a> from RPGNow.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, while I have your attention, if you're going to Dreamation it looks like there's a couple of sessions of Annalise happening, thanks to "superstar" Connie Allison. Also "dude's a machine" Adam Dray tends to throw some down when he can. So that's very cool, and a public thank you to you good folks!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256642/#Comment_256642" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T11:56:19+00:00" title="February 15, 2010 11:56AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Post-weekend bump, just in case-ies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'd be curious on whether folks are finding these useful, and in what ways (or, alternately, in which ways you'd <i>wish</i> they were useful).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256646/#Comment_256646" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T12:19:17+00:00" title="February 15, 2010 12:19PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have Annalise, but these are useful to me as intriguing examples of the game's versatility RE setting and color, as well as nifty creations in their own right.

I'm glad to hear that the scenarios are hitting those targets (showcasing versatility + being nifty). Out of curiosity, is there something specific you're looking for from the publishing side that would make that purchasing decision easier (as opposed to being dependent on your own taste, schedule, etc)?<br/>\n<br/>\nJesse, thank you for writing it! I know I did the same thing with the Voyage of the Auspicious, dialing down some elements so that they wouldn't push the scenario too far in a specific direction. It's an interesting line, figuring out what the "right" info is to be usable to different playstyles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257095/#Comment_257095" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T11:28:48+00:00" title="February 18, 2010 11:28AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Nathan,<br><br>In all honesty, probably not.  My deal is that I have too many games I'm not playing currently, plus limited budget.  When I've been flush, I've bought games.  I'm not gaming currently because of scheduling challenges (two small kids, busy wife, tons of other projects, hunting for contract gigs, marathon training, etc.).  And when I do think about gaming, I have a stack of a dozen games I already haven't tried.  When I do start, my preference, and that of my likely players, is to engage in a long-running campaign rather than a limited series.<br><br>I'd like to get Annalise and probably will at some point when I have a few spare bucks, because I've become interested in RPG design for design's sake, but there's a part of me that's, like, "Jesus, I don't need to add <i>another</i> to the stack."  I'm really trying to think more about using what I've got rather than putting another opportunity cost onto the imaginary gaming table.  I already feel ADHD when I consider the options to put before a group.<br><br>That said, the free material you're putting out is really top-notch and has kindled real interest.  So I think you're doing what you need to do, under the circumstances.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
