Also that the noise sometimes interfered when your game ran longer.  A few times we were still playing while people who had finished held loud conversations right next to us, to the point where I had a tough time hearing other folks in my group.  Minor quibble, though, and only a problem in the "main" room.<br/><br/>The GPNW signup threads posted on the wall weren't super-clear whether a particular game was filled, at least not requiring one to parse through the thread.

Also Belltown is a 15 minute bus ride for me, so that was nice as well.  As for signups, yes the pre-con signup stuff was very difficult to decode.

I had a very difficult time finding parking (until Sunday, when I showed up early and grabbed a street spot) and ended up with a minor ticket.<br/><br/>I had an amazing con and would happily attend for the next twenty years if things stayed exactly the same.  If I had to suggest things that could use improvement, I'd second Blake and request more noise-control measures--we discussed having a designated noise calibrator, but I don't think that ever happened.  Even a bell that went off every hour just to remind people to lower their voices a bit would probably do the trick, as would freestanding dividers of some kind.  More/smaller rooms would help too, although obviously that's not possible at Freehold, which was a great venue otherwise.<br/><br/>I agree with Mickey that the restaurant proximity was great and the slots were very nicely split up.  The group hug before each slot was really useful--I don't remember if anything similar was implemented last year.  But I do think in the future it should include an actual group hug!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215161/#Comment_215161" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T16:33:41+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  4:33PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 7:00PM by johnzo.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noise was suboptimal but I could deal with it; in my experience, the only con that's ever solved this problem was the Dragonflight that put the RPGs in dorm rooms.<br/><br/>I think the noise situation was better than last year.  We crammed a *lot* of games into those three conference rooms in 2008!  Nothing for me this year was as noise-impacted as Montsegur was for me last year.<br/><br/>( I apologize to those who were impacted by the  ... uh ...  exuberant ... Beast Hunters game on Sunday afternoon.  That game blew out my voice.  No game has ever blown out my voice before. )<br/><br/>Belltown is a great place for a con.  I love cons I can walk to, and having plentiful eating options locally means your dining group doesn't have to figure out transportation. <br/><br/>Food was brilliant, though I sympathize with those who call for more veggie options.

I don't know how long in advance the marathon or gay pride parade were planned but if it is possible, I would try to dodge major events that block off traffic.

In hindsight I think putting that half of the sheets elsewhere would have given us more sound dampening, and it might have been worth it to draw the curtains near the AC more closed.<br/><br/>All that aside, I agree sound was still much better than the hotel.<br/><br/>Note to self: make names on badges even bigger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215187/#Comment_215187" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T19:05:35+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  7:05PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also liked the location. I don't have any previous GPs to compare to, but as the Tegu has declared, the private clubhouse aspect made things feel welcoming, cozy and personal. Lots of cons are held at hotels or convention centers, and they feel. . .well, like cons. This felt different. Almost like a sleepover for grownups. It created a gaming space that was more socially intimate and less businesslike or clamorous. I liked it a lot.<br/><br/>I wasn't in on the feast, having decided to come at the very last minute. The surplus of beverages throughout the weekend was wonderful, though.<br/><br/>The noise thing was a bit of an issue, but not bad. It was no trouble clearing out the library room for something that needed less noise pollution. Some of the solutions Mike suggests sound worth trying.<br/><br/>The gaming slots were a little off-putting in that so much cool stuff was already full before arrival. Granted, this is partly due to my last-minute attendance, but I like the idea jackson mentions of having only half the events pre-posted. I prefer to approach my gaming schedule more impromptu, and I had great success with that this weekend, getting in a lot of cool games with a lot of cool people. But there was other stuff I was keen on and had no chance of getting into.<br/><br/>That said, on-site facilitation of the game sessions was <i>phenomenal!</i> At the top of every slot, Tony or Ping or someone would be coralling everyone and matching unattached players with open or empty games. it was so cool, especially for someone like me who wasn't in on the early scheduling. I was able to do cool stuff in every block because of the organizers' care and effort. Thanks so much, guys!<br/><br/>Everyone's been telling me for like a year and a half that GPNW would change my life. Now I believe them! Thanks so much!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215197/#Comment_215197" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T19:41:41+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  7:41PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am one of those crazy super-organized people who likes the benefits associated with that; I took the day off to ensure I could sign up for things right at noon on the Monday of sign-up, and I'd registered for my hotel, etc. two months earlier.<br/><br/>I wouldn't want fewer events posted early - if anything I'd like more events posted early.  But I like the idea of people only being able to pre-sign up for three things.  I signed up for 4 of the 7 slots within three minutes of "unlock," leaving the others intentionally open.  A lot of the games were full within those three minutes.  I had the extreme pleasure of being able to game most of the weekend with the other people who were equally crazy-enthused <i>and</i> able to sign up immediately, but I was with the same awesome people in most of those games!

More mobile sound baffles might help.<br/><br/>Finding parking was really difficult, but that's a hazard of a great downtown location with good nearby meal choices.  I had to move my car from the meter early Saturday morning and then again Saturday evening back to metered parking.  I had to drive around for almost a half-hour each time; I did find eventually find a relatively cheap place only a few blocks away.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was even better than my first GPNW experience two years ago which was itself better even than either of my amazing Dreamation experiences.

The "group hug" thing is really smart, but I would have loved to see time carved out for a sort of mandatory "this is all of us, in one place, paying attention" thing.  By the time people gathered for announcements and matchmaking, other folks were already playing.  I think, on a social level, a moment when all the participants were in one place would be a good thing.  Also:  Group photo, maybe.<br/><br/>2.  You guys drink a lot of beer!  There was a lot of delicious looking extra fancy beer at the feast, and as a non-drinker I wanted some delicious extra-fancy non-beer.  I think providing an appealing non-alcoholic alternative at all times is a good idea from a liability standpoint if nothing else.  I was really glad for the tons of water, though!<br/><br/>3.  It might be worth formally blocking off the library in advance for games that need it.  On Sunday morning, we sat down there for a game and soon realized that our table (House of Cards) needed to leave the space to Chris' freeform sampler table, who required quiet and stillness in the same way we had to shout and jump around.  So we got up and left, but I could easily see a situation where a game was spoiled by a boisterous, oblivious neighbor.<br/><br/>4.  Ping and I talked about sharing lessons learned and I just wanted to put that out there for follow-up.  I think all the people who organize these events have a lot to share.  I learned a lot by observing how you guys did things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215275/#Comment_215275" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T06:39:15+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  6:39AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys did a great job with the event.

Definitely the best-organized large gaming event I've ever been a part of. Like Jason said earlier, the several times I offered to help, most of the work had been done already. Serious kudos to Ping, Tony and Phil. You guys really raised the bar for peer-cons.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the food on Friday. Having people show up to a chill venue and slowly get acclimatized and be able to mingle and meet people easily was SO much better than meeting at a crowded restaurant. And while I only partook of the beer on Friday night, I was glad it was there:)<br/><br/>The venues for the first two GPNW were good but kind of sterile in comparison. This venue really DID feel like a clubhouse for geeks. <br/><br/>The noise level was loud in some cases but not so bad. I only had to ask a table to turn the volume down once, and of course it was Ogre:)<br/><br/>Jason's group was totally cool to recognize that his crazy House of Cards game on Sunday morning was going to dominate my quiet contemplative game of The Believers, and so his group simply left the library room and moved to the empty room next door.

I knew Seattle kicked ass, but I didn't realize <em>heaven was so freakin close</em>!<br/><br/>Paul Riddle is canonized, as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>So, for my thoughts:<br/><br/>* The couch in the hallway was counter-productive. It caused people to congregate in the walk path. I was guilty of this as much as so many of us.<br/><br/>* The quote boards would be better placed out of the walk path next time -- people stopping in the middle to read them + couches taking up space = hallway clog.<br/><br/>* This is going to me bitching for a moment:  There needed to be a designated "quiet room." On Friday night, I gathered my peeps for Montsegur 1244, and it seemed like there was a bit of "quiet room" vibe going on in the library...you know, where the two games of 3:16 where?<br/><br/>Yeah, no quiet there. And the other rooms weren't either. After that night, I was going to talk with Tony/Phil/Ping about a quiet room for next year...and then I heard someone say "the quiet room" on Saturday.<br/><br/>For a moment, I was livid. The 3:16 games could have been played anywhere, and I got stuck between the cacophonous middle room and the "everyone meets here" main room.  I quickly calmed, since the game went well in spite of the noise &amp; constant distraction. (Plus, y'all gave me free beer, so I couldn't hold a grudge.)<br/><br/>Next year, if we still have a quiet space (and I hope we do), could we maybe have that clearly noted with some rules posted on it?<br/><br/>* Also, S-G usernames on badges (for those on S-G). Here, I have the advantage of hovering over a username and (hopefully) seeing a real name pop up. I tried that with the badges by starring hard, but it didn't happen. Someone please fix the Javascript on the badges.<br/><br/>* I expected more shark attacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215507/#Comment_215507" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T14:46:06+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  2:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to note before that I wasn't that excited about the 2 1/2 hour slots.

Overall I though this year was great, and it was obvious that the organizers had put a lot of work &amp; thought into the whole deal. My thanks for that!<br/><br/>Location:<br/><br/>While I thought the theatre itself was great, I preferred the location of previous years (the university district.) The first year venue remains, in my mind, the ideal, what with the meals-included/cafeteria socialization and the affordable/social dorm room setup. Much of this sentiment comes down to the stress/expense of parking in downtown Seattle -- but the downtown hotels also leave something to be desired.<br/><br/>Parking:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite>Let people know about the Seattle Center parking garages. $7 per 10 hours of parking is a sweet deal in my downtown-Seattle book.</blockquote>\nThere was a lot three or four blocks from the venue (on third, next to the Bath &amp; Beyond) where you could park for the whole weekend for $15. Unfortunately, I did not find out about it until after I had already put down $8 for interim Friday evening parking. Triply unfortunately, the lot closed at 8pm on Sunday night, so my group had to pony up an extra $25 to spring our car out of the lot. But unless the lot vanishes within the next year, it should be possible to park for the whole weekend for $15.<br/><br/>Sign-Ups:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>if anything I'd like more events posted early [...] A lot of the games were full within those three minutes.</blockquote>\nThe pre-sign-up situation was pretty aggravating to me this year -- though the aggravation very quickly subsided. But, channeling my initial reaction when I saw all the printouts: oh look, almost every single game posted was full <i>within an hour</i> of the sign-ups going live. Many of these games were unique opportunities to either play with Out-of-Town Guests or to play games that, due to the required organization/commitment (eg. The Upgrade), were unlikely to be run as pick-up options. It is obvious that people from out of town and people running games like that will be more likely to use the online pre-sign-up stuff, and I hardly blame them. <br/><br/>But to come in and see every single game on the board (so far) that I wanted to play not only full -- but, based on the timestamps, full within minutes of their even being available -- was pretty frustrating. I'm sure it would have been even more frustrating if I hadn't purposefully avoided the online sign-ups, because I would not have been at the sign-up pages in time anyways. Luckily, as mentioned, the aggravation was easily washed away by the flood of awesome pick-up gaming. But even so, every time I looked at the sign-up boards I couldn't help but feel like there was a tier of the con that I didn't have access to -- an unreasonable feeling, most likely, but there you have it.<br/><br/>Quiet Room:<br/><br/>Mostly I'd like to echo what everyone else has already said. The library was pretty good for this but having it organized would be even better -- the only problem I see being that, by default, everyone wants a quiet space for their game. Because it was unofficial this year that meant that only groups that were willing to risk a certain amount of social friction (uh guys could you maybe move, really sorry, but...) were able to secure the space. That said, I think better to have it known up-front and have some pre-schedule jockeying than to have people feel like they can't run their awesome-quiet-weird game anywhere.<br/><br/>Mostly I kind of wish the space had one more single-table room somewhere, or an out of the way hallway (as in previous years' venues), but you can't have it all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215540/#Comment_215540" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T15:37:40+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  3:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Next year: potluck.<br/><br/>Also, official "quiet room" idea seconded.

By chance, I was working from home that day; otherwise things would have turned out a lot differently.  But I've also been feeling bad about this.  In fact, I thought about withdrawing from a couple of pre-sign-up games to make way for other players.  But then I didn't want to give those GMs the impression that I didn't care for playing in their games after all... that was kind of an uneasy position for me.<br/><br/>So. Here's a thought: let everyone pre-sign-up only for one game each day.  That is, on Sign Up Day 1, I get to put my name down in one of the slots, and so does everyone else.  On Sign Up Day 2, everyone gets a second slot (and those who missed Day 1 can catch up).  And so on. This will allow us to still fill up the slots before the convention if we're unsure about having enough players.  GMs who want to reserve a slot or two certainly can do so on their own.<br/><br/>What'cha think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215730/#Comment_215730" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T10:04:43+00:00" title="July  1, 2009 10:04AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a pretty good idea, as is the one about only pre-registering half the slots for a game, leaving the rest for at-convention signups..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215734/#Comment_215734" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T10:19:00+00:00" title="July  1, 2009 10:19AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Misuba:  <br/><br/>Potluck doesn't work so well for those of us coming directly from work, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215745/#Comment_215745" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T10:34:18+00:00" title="July  1, 2009 10:34AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys.<br/>Echo, echo, echo most of the comments made here.<br/><br/>I didn't find the Belltown district to be amazing.<br/>Parking was difficult, exacerbated by heavy construction and parade blockades.<br/>I found some good restaurants and some lame ones.<br/>Ultimately, as a tourist, the district didn't wow me or scream "this is a neat place!"<br/><br/>I wasn't impressed by the Friday Night Feast.<br/>It seemed to be, predominantly, large trays of meat and cafeteria side dishes.<br/>This was highly disappointing at $17.<br/><br/>That said, beer and pop and water!

Assuming every opening listed was filled, that's about 32 people including the organizers. If you looked at that you'd say, oh crap, everything is full up.<br/><br/>But there were 70 people at the con, so more than half the gamers are still floating, they just haven't said what they're doing yet. The people who did pre-reg might be missing the cool thing someone only reveals on the spot.<br/><br/>It seems like there was simply more demand for pre-reg then there were facilitators willing to commit to pre-reg slots. So there appeared to be scarcity of games, but really there was just scarcity of commitment.<br/><br/><br/>* EDIT: encouraging facilitators to volunteer to leave X spots open would be fine with me, but not requiring it                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215865/#Comment_215865" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T17:28:03+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  5:28PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Powell</cite>We're all in this together, is all I'm sayin.</blockquote>\nI volunteered up beer runs on Saturday and Sunday.

I was never bored, and I never lacked for an excellent game or awesome fellow players.  Thanks so much for putting that together. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI somewhat agree with the tiny gripes above.  The meal was pretty good, but I wouldn't have paid $17 for it anywhere else.  The oontz oontz music coming up through the floor was a bit disconcerting.  But frankly, with the pure liquid awesome going around, I quickly stopped noticing the throb from below.  (as it were.)<br/>\n<br/>\nif I knew exactly how it was going to turn out going in, I would have still come and played without hesitation.
