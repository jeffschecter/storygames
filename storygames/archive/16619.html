Here are a few big ones I've come up with...<br/>________<br/><br/><b>"Foreshadow your Fate by adding new content---particularly NPCs, events, and facts about the game world."</b><br/>One of the fun things about Fates is that they add new stuff into the narrative that the GM or the other players can interact with. Experienced players realize this, and thus often foreshadow their Fates by bringing in all sorts of NPCs, events, and facts external to their characters. New players who don't realize this tend to foreshadow their Fate by narrating peculiar actions on the part of their character that hint at a dark secret, but don't bring in much that the other people at the table can interact with.<br/><br/><b>\u201cPlay to discover who your character is. Be flexible, start with a basic idea and add details throughout play.\u201d</b><br/>This relates to the character's personality, past, and Fate. Because so much content is created (or at least revealed) in play, players never know ahead of time what might inspire them. Thus it works better (and quicker) to start with only a real basic or minimal idea of who your character is and what their Fate is, and then let the events of play inspire or inform the details. Beyond that, character ownership is much more flexible than it first appears, since all the Fates allow the player to introduce facts about the other PCs. Thus you never know when another player might narrate something about your own character that forces you to rethink who they are or what their Fate is.<br/><br/><b>Weaving</b><br/>I think I list weaving as a GM technique in the book, but nowadays I really view weaving as something that only players should do. Weaving is when a player takes a seemingly unrelated element of another person's Fate and ties it to their own.<br/><br/><b>\u201cAct ambiguously or suspiciously. Let your character's actions speak for themselves, don't explain yourself.\u201d</b><br/>The point here is do stuff that forces judgment on the part of the other players/PCs. Whether positive or negative, this sort of stuff creates movement and drama in your PC's relationship to the rest of the company, which makes the game more interesting.<br/>_________<br/><br/>How do those sound?

It's that thing that turns up every now and then of somebody wanting to play a character that's really enigmatic or mysterious (or angsty), but they're treating it as a performance with the other players in the frame of audience who are expected to appreciate the enigma rather than interact with it. It generally doesn't go so well in roleplaying which has a lot of the egalitarian about it, where it might in a book or movie where the author can place a lot of privilege on particular storylines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380245/#Comment_380245" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-30T12:45:52+00:00" title="May 30, 2012 12:45PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ++ I often tell players to do something highly specific, but don't explain why.  When I do this, I tell them it's a form of fishing.  A player who describes her ronin as "kneeling beside that small statue, lighting a deep, woody scented incense, and leaving behind a carving of a dragon" is actively saying "HEY YOU GUYS!  Work what I just did into your fate if you think it's cool.  Maybe you recognize my worship?"  So long as they are genuinely receptive to other player's interpretations, it can only lead to more fun.  Equally as fun is "and in the middle of the struggle to cross the bridge, three monsters appear in the trees to watch.  They have no faces but continue to laugh..."<br/><br/>It falls under your second and third points, but it kind of conflicts with your first.  There's some subtlety to figuring out what kind of details other players can work with, but that's not something you can prescribe, I think.<br/><br/>++ Also, I tell them to concentrate on stealing narration.  It's a fantastic way to earn trust, if you describe how awesome someone's success was, and it can highlight use of their Abilities and make them feel awesome.  It makes players trust players more, and it also is a great way to show everyone else what you think is cool.  Separately, stealing someone's failure from the GM is a great time to work in a Fate related event.  It shows them "this is a burden we must both face."<br/><br/>++ Lastly, I tell them to pace themselves.  If they want to come out and throw their Dark Fate early, overcome it, and be done with it when the others are still struggling with theirs, then go for it.  Yes, it's usually more fun if we are all guessing, if we are all tense to discover these things and distrusting one another, but it can be really exhausting.  Trust your gut and do it when it feels right.  There's always a chance to play again.  Just remember that once it's been revealed and resolved, draw others to the forefront.<br/><br/><i>Disclaimer:  I don't have any advice from play, only from GMing and demoing at conventions.

I'm starting to wonder if it would be helpful to distinguish between "hinting at" versus "foreshadowing" your Fate (terminology I'm making up right now). "Hinting" would be those times that a player narrates in color that alludes to their character's Fate, while "foreshadowing" would specifically refer to the act of narrating in new content.<br/><br/><br/>"Hinting": <i>After a battle with ronin bandits, Washiro cuts the mon off the kimonos of all the fallen samurai and stuffs them into his sleeve.</i><br/><br/>"Foreshadowing": <i>As the company approaches the temple, an old wrinkled monk comes out to greet them. But when he nears Washiro, his eyes widen and he stops in his tracks. "How can his be, I thought you were dead, Washiro!"</i><br/><br/><br/>"Hinting" certainly has its place (particularly early on), but as the adventure progresses you want to sure you're actually "foreshadowing" now and again.<br/>_______________<br/><br/>Actually, here's a question for GMs (that relates to players): If a player narrates in a NPC (like I just did in the above example), how much info do you feel you need to start playing them? Are there questions you generally ask the players about them?<br/><br/>I often ask a) <i>"Who are they?"</i> and b) <i>"What is their relationship to your PC?"</i> and sometimes c) <i>"Is there anything special about them that I need to know as GM?"</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380329/#Comment_380329" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T07:24:03+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  7:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talking towards the differences between "Hinting" and "Foreshadowing" is cool as an advice thing, but I think formalizing the distinction in the rules, or on the character sheet, seems a bit far.  New players (the majority of the people I've played with) naturally start out with the hinting, then grow to the foreshadowing with comfort and encouragement.<br/><br/><br/>--<br/><br/>(NPCs question)<br/>I try to handle this organically.  I will tell them when we go over the rules that the key word on that sheet is "introduce" and that I'll take ownership.  I can usually push as hard as I want, leaning on them and trying to separate the party.  They have the power to push back.  As an example.<br/><br/>GM - You navigate the last of the Aokigahara [etc etc etc push towards conflict]<br/><br/>P- A young woman comes down from the path ahead.  Her dress is fringed with blood, and she looks distraught.<br/><br/>GM - Cool.  She falls at that moment, too tired to walk.  "Father?  Father!  It is done... oh... why did you make me?"<br/><br/>P- She stands again, but this time we notice she doesn't have feet.  She floats inches from the ground on fading ankles.  I run to her but she disappears in my arms.<br/><br/>Here, I had an idea, and I ran with it, no questions.  The player had a different one, and he used his fate to "introduce an event."<br/>I only stop the game and ask if I think the player is likely to feel bullied, if they seem like they might respect my narration more than their own power as a player.  Admittedly, that's just a style thing.  Luckily, if it's important, players have generally introduced it before I take over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380353/#Comment_380353" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T13:09:25+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  1:09PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely run into a minority of players who basically sit on their Fate card to keep it's secret. Either because that's what they are used it in other games. Or because they don't know how to bring it into play. I hear this after almost every session I've run, usually from one player. I think some Fates may be more challenging than others to bring in. But it's been awhile since I've played it, so don't remember specifics.<br/><br/>Players who are experienced with TMW, or very comfortable with SG in general, can have a big perceived advantage in playing the game. At least from the vantage point of less-experienced players who see the narrative being influenced more by those who know TMW. I've seen that a lot.<br/><br/>I think it would be very useful to have hints about how to bring their Fate into play on the character sheet. And for that matter Tim, all of those quotes you list in the OP would work well on the character sheet. Nothing wrong with spelling it out for people to kickstart things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380355/#Comment_380355" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T13:36:55+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  1:36PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite><b>\u201cAct ambiguously or suspiciously.

I think the underlying goal of doing show-don't-tell and not belaboring the character's motivation makes sense, but I'm not sure I'd get there if I started from "act ambiguously or suspiciously". I think maybe I want the "suspicious" stuff to feel emergent rather than intentional.

Here's been my experience with them (from my most favorite to my least):<br/><br/>Revenge - Awesome. Almost automatically awesome. If all the Fate cards were Revenge, the game would still totally work (be different, but work)<br/><br/>Desperately In Love - Also Awesome<br/><br/>Unholy Pact - Also Also Awesome.<br/><br/>True Motives - In play, this actually usually seems to elicit the same behavior as Unholy Pact. Though in one game the characters True Motive was to take his birthright as Sun Emperor, which he needed the Witch's power to do, or something like that. Which was pretty boss.<br/><br/>Past Allegiance - Solid. Sometimes, again, feels like Unholy Pact in play, but sometimes not. Depends on the player for real payoff, for sure.<br/><br/>Worst Fear - least fun, either because the player doesn't really have an idea that excites them, or because the worst fear doesn't turn out to have anything to do with the other characters.It seems to leave the player feeling like the other players got better Dark Fates than they did.<br/><br/>I think Worst Fear is the only one that doesn't require or at least imply a specific kind of relationship with another character (either Witch, other PC or NPC), which may something to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380413/#Comment_380413" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T05:26:41+00:00" title="June  1, 2012  5:26AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to respectfully disagree.  I see Worst Fear cause some trouble on occasion, but the Absolute Best reveals I've ever seen have been from Worst Fear.  And the two examples that leap to my mind are from players who had no experience with the game, or even the genre.<br/><br/>I've seen all six cards tie into the Witch directly.<br/><br/>I've seen all six cards be used to pull other characters into their drama.<br/><br/>I started out leaving Worst Fear out when I had fewer than six players, but I totally changed my mind and haven't regretted it since.  It might be that Worst Fear puts an uneven burden on one player.  I mean, in order to have some "Worst Fear" manifest itself somewhere on the mountain, they usually start foreshadowing much earlier than the other players (to make it a consistent Threat) or they explode into some large threat just as things get heated.  Often, the Fear plays out as a metaphor, or some kind of existential assault, which forces players to engage the ronin directly.  (All fates must be <i>resolved</i> after all...)<br/><br/>That dissymmetry fuels good sessions, I think.  Having one or two ronin who foreshadow more up front, then slow down.  And at the same time having some ronin who only hint, misdirect, and feed off the early bloomers.  Then we're good and intermixed as we move into later chapters.<br/><br/>- As for the Ambiguity in the fates, yes.  Any of them could essentially be any of the other ones.  I've seen all of them (except Past Allegiance <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and Revenge</span>) be use declare "I am, in fact, the Witch, you fools."  Oddly, when you have new players and you <i>don't</i> tell them up front what all the Dark Fates are (just shuffle and deal with no prior knowledge).  It leads to some pretty great moments.  <br/><br/>In my opinion, It distracts from play when players already know what the 6 are and are just playing that "I'll bet she has Revenge, and I think he has Unholy Pact, and... " game.  The 6 are worded vaguely enough now to let everyone spread their influence around, and possibly be secretly fighting for the same thing, even if they can't trust the people on their side.  Any game that can make me feel like a Double Agent is a win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380422/#Comment_380422" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T07:08:43+00:00" title="June  1, 2012  7:08AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone played with home-brewed Dark Fates?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380430/#Comment_380430" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-01T08:08:39+00:00" title="June  1, 2012  8:08AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only when I re-skinned the game.<br/><br/>But I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts... ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380671/#Comment_380671" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T00:32:28+00:00" title="June  4, 2012 12:32AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, the cards. <br/><br/>Revenge - Solid.<br/><br/>Desperately In Love - Solid.<br/><br/>Unholy Pact - Solid.<br/><br/>True Motives - Far too vague, like all the others rolled in one.

I pulled 'Worst Fear' on my first time out and had no problem with it. It came out relatively early which I think - given that the other Dark Fates came out very late - was probably a good thing. It made my character creation very straightforward - my ronin's Worst Fear was on the mountain, he'd met it before, succumbed and lost his master as a result, and _now he'd come back_. What more do you need? <br/><br/>Hats off to the GM, though, for giving me the space to run with it. I did it in a typical new player way (as the OP describes) of dropping hints as to my purpose to face my fear of the Witch's most fearsome creature. The GM gave me a couple of big scary beasties guarding the castle gate claiming to be the Witch's most fearsome creature, obviously offering them to me as my Worst Fear, and then didn't bat an eyelid when my character said 'No, neither of you are. Because neither of you are the creature I faced before' and, instead of making us roll through a pretty pointless combat (we had max trust in each other) the big scary beasties promptly _let us in_.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it got resolved before we faced the Mountain Witch. And that was pretty cool too because, as I'd completed my Dark Fate, I had a competely free hand on how to react when one of the other players revealed their Unholy Pact, presenting the Witch with his two comrades. I thought, well, I lost my master to my fear, I've overcome that fear, so now I need a new master... why not? And so I sided with the Pact and then tried to persuade the third player to join us as well which led to my personal crowning moment as my ronin said: <br/><br/>"Katasumi, I do not wish to draw my blade against you. We have climbed the mountain and faced its enemies together. We are sword-brothers, you and I. But if you do not give up your quest I will not hesitate to cut you down. For I am no longer ronin. Now I am samurai."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
