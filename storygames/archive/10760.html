"raid an evil stronghold!" "go to a place to find an anti-evil gem!" "Go fight an evil boss before he completes an evil ritual of evil!" <br/><br/>So yeah at its barest essentials it's about adventurers (sometimes they're heroes, but not always- hero implies saving people is a top priority, but it's not as much in D&amp;D) that go to places and do interesting stuff involving fighting and treasure, at least tangentially (often as the focus).<br/><br/>I'm honestly not sure you could make those elements stronger, at least not without eliminating some of the options. I mean, you could make a better heroes go on a journey to stop evil game, and you can make a somewhat better "raid a dungeon game" but overall D&amp;D is pretty damn good at its job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238742/#Comment_238742" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T10:35:52+00:00" title="October 22, 2009 10:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only really know the first one, but here it is:<br/><br/>Negotiating a hostile environment for gain, while trying to maximize gain and minimize cost through strategy (especially clever management of resources and abilities), and <i>also</i> walking a precarious line between working with your partymates for maximum communal gain and exploiting your partymates for maximum <i>personal</i> gain.<br/><br/>These elements are pretty strong in that first edition, but they could be stronger.

Both your examples have a built terrain in which the experiences happen, rather than one created on-the-fly.  Is that important?<br/><br/>I ask because I feel that's become the central point around which my experience of old-skool roleplaying has revolved.  I've gone from being the sort of GM that comes up with 500 years of history for a place (seriously) to one who mostly plays it by ear.  And I feel the gaming has been better for it.<br/><br/>My partner's starting a new campaign on Sunday with nothing more than a vague concept: a sudden gold rush on a long abandoned borderland. What amazed me was given such a hazy opening, the group of players (whose experience ranged from heavy indie-gamers to someone who's only every played D&amp;D in its various forms) came up with characters just *dripping* with Situation, all of them coming to the town for different and interesting reasons (or being a local whose become involved in the happenings of the gold rush).  He noted this morning that he's got nothing really planned.  Which in my opinion is AWESOME. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Has our old-skool gaming become something other than the survive-the-game "purity" of D&amp;D [(players) vs. (environment) vs. (each other)?].  Have we drifted from D&amp;D gamism to something more akin to narrativism with the trappings of old-skool still in place?  And if we have, is it still D&amp;D? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In every example I've seen in the thread thus far, the locked-in/on-rails nature of the adventure seems to be an important aspect:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>they advance along the DM's "stop a great evil" plot that involves "evil is attacking a town!" "raid an evil stronghold!" "go to a place to find an anti-evil gem!" "Go fight an evil boss before he completes an evil ritual of evil!"</blockquote>\nIs that true?  Would it still be "pure" D&amp;D if the plot, locations, monsters, whatever came out of the choices the players made?  Or does the pre-planning somehow link up to the gamist idea of a fair playing field, and the real challenge/fun exists in navigating what's already been created?<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238862/#Comment_238862" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T08:00:10+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  8:00AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No,you can certainly play D&amp;D on the fly and still have it be "pure".

I think one could argue that BoL is an attempt to strip out all the fiddly tactical bits from D&amp;D to get at the core of the D&amp;D story. Turns out that, once you strip out all the fiddly tactical bits, there is no core D&amp;D story at the center.<br/><br/>Obviously some of that is on how we ran BoL. But seriously, even when we really focused on consciously hammering at the fantasy roleplaying tropes, there was just so...so very little to hold on to.<br/><br/>Some of that has to do with my changing relationship with RPGs. Some of it, though, I think comes down to the fact that it's very hard to extract "the D&amp;D experience" from its mechanical context.<br/><br/>At least in my own experience, there is no bare essential D&amp;D.

BoL, at heart, seems to me to be the D&amp;D anti-story.  In BoL, you don't get rich, you don't get to change the world, you just keep on living in a single hyperreal, sensual, violent moment.   If you do try to be future-oriented and Protestant and hang onto your riches, then your development is stunted.  It is only through renouncing the world and casting aside material gain that you can personally develop.  It's kinda cool.<br/><br/>Whereas D&amp;D suggests a game that a guidance counsellor would earnestly recommend, a game of delayed gratification.  You start off as a little ninth-grade peon with just a few hit points, but if you're patient, work hard, have the right friends, bite off only a little more than you can chew, and keep your eyes on the prize -- then someday, you get to be Freddy Mercury.<br/><br/>To the original question, I also guess that the core of D&amp;D in practice is something about functional little anarchies (the adventuring parties) running around in a world of strict hierarchies (anything that has a level attached to it.)  It's a geek fantasy in which you and your best friends can each have well-defined roles on a team, and you can navigate a world of ordered, appropriate and sensible challenges together.  <br/><br/>Though I don't know if any of this is universal or fundamental or truth. D&amp;D contains multitudes, and I think if you want to boil it down, you need to boil down the playership.  <br/><br/>Maybe the answer to your question is in a Creative Agenda essay somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238987/#Comment_238987" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T10:08:31+00:00" title="October 24, 2009 10:08AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite>Can you break it down even more to talk about what players do and what the DM does, not what characters do?</blockquote>\nSure.<br/><br/>The players engage in the aforementioned strategies to guide their characters through the hostile environment for maximum gain and minimal loss. They do this by a.) asking for as much information as they can get by asking questions of the DM (usually from their characters' frames of reference), b.) relying on player knowledge (of magical items &amp; monster profiles &amp; so on), and c.) describing the actions of their characters and waiting for the DM to adjudicate the results (either by fiat or dice rolls or a combination thereof).<br/><br/>The DM's* primary thing is to challenge the players. <i>He does not compete with them</i>. He merely sets things up so that the dungeon will kill the PCs unless the players do something to prevent that. He creates (beforehand or on the fly) &amp; presents the dungeon, and roleplays its denizens, honestly and accurately (this includes describing what the PCs see and experience, and answering the players' questions, usually through a filter of what their PCs would and would not be able to notice).<br/><br/>*The version I'm talking about calls him the Referee, and I think it's a more apt description.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240094/#Comment_240094" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-02T05:54:26+00:00" title="November  2, 2009  5:54AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2009 6:25AM by Tavis.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Marshall Burns' breakdown is an excellent one.<br/>\n<br/>\njohnzo, I haven't played Barbarians of Lemuria but as I was saying in the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10720&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">Everything Old is New Again</a> thread, the idea of characters throwing away their wealth on sensual pleasures of one kind or another is older than D&amp;D; itself - not just in the sense that that's a description of Conan or Fafhrd &amp; the Gray Mouser stories, but that it's likely that such an experience point system was already part of the Blackmoor campaign by the time Arneson introduced Gygax to the game. I do think that a core D&amp;D; idea is that the players get to be an anarchist collective that runs around kicking over the established order. You could tie this to the issue of gaining &amp; spending wealth with an idea of Delany's that (if I understand it right) the sword &amp; sorcery genre is all about the moment when capitalism emerges as a disruptive force: the story focuses on a bunch of outsider adventurers striding into town, gold in hand, and cutting across all the interdependencies of feudal society.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo quote whiteknife, which I haven't figured out how to do in the BBCode I used for the rest of this post:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">I think the "standard" game is that you make an adventure ahead of time (as evidenced by the number of published adventures, dungeon master's guide advice, and just generally what I've seen.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe original AD&amp;D; Dungeon Master's Guide has tons of random tables that are extremely useful for making an adventure on the fly; any advice it has about planning ahead of time is far outweighed in page count by the stuff that lets you dice for what happens next as the players cause you to need it. This is also a very prominent feature of early stuff by Bledsaw (e.g. the Judges' Guild Ready Ref Sheets) and Hargraves (the Arduin Trilogy is mostly random tables of one kind or another). I've got a piece coming out in Fight On! <a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a> (preliminary notes <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/random-events-make-you-say-yes-to-links/" rel="nofollow">here</a>) where I suggest that the dice-based, on-the-fly, reacting-to-player-input play style that these kinds of tables facilitate so well might spring from the same improv roots (by way of Dave Wesely) as Graham Walmsley talks about in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/play-unsafe/1436677" rel="nofollow">Play Unsafe</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublished adventures are misleading because they grew out of tournament play, where having a static situation that each group of players would encounter &amp; that would be adjucated by each DM the same way was essential to competition. Of course, facilitating that strain of play was a major design goal for AD&amp;D;, and new players who entered gaming had many easily-available examples of tournament adventures &amp; few clear pointers to what the free-form approach would look like, so that approach soon dominated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe level playing field is important, but you can get that from the idea that the random encounter chart &amp; the rolls of the dice are an objective force separate from the players or referee. Setting things up ahead of time also helps reinforce the idea that the world exists as a thing in itself, and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2009/09/gygax-in-europa.html" rel="nofollow">Gygax's 1975 fanzine article</a> talks about setting up a considerable extent of his dungeons ahead of time, but descriptions of how he &amp; Rob Kuntz ran the campaign suggest that the setup was much sketchier than published adventures - more "here's a map and some ideas of what the players might find if they decide to go there" than "here's the goal the PCs are seeking and the obstacles in their path."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
