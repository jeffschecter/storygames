I wonder if as we've transitioned from traditional GM-driven gaming the creative control enjoyed by the GM has in fact been replaced with the creative control of designing a game. Just like a "traditional GM forcing his story on the players" via illusionist story-telling techniques, the designer does a similar thing via game mechanics, premise, etc. End result: they play<i>your</i>game.</blockquote>\nSo this was posted in another thread, and I thought it was worth discussing. It's an interesting point.<br/><br/>I kind of agree with jbuchert. It does seem like a lot of indie games... Hmm. How does one say this? And I'm still learning about the story game scene, so please don't interpret this the wrong way. It's not a criticism, it's an observation. <br/><br/>The railroading seems hard-coded into the rules. And that can be a good thing -- people get a lot out of it. They like it. So do I!<br/><br/>But it's sort of like, the group agrees, okay, here's the part where we have the emotional breakdown, and after that, we'll have a conflict scene, and then Jimmy's character has to die. If a GM in a traditional game declared this structure beforehand, it would be cause for weeping and gnashing of teeth and rending of garments. But because the structure is determined by the rules, and agreed upon by the group, it's an acceptable roadmap for the evolution of narrative.<br/><br/>Is it still 'railroading' if everyone in the group agrees on the direction and length of the train tracks?<br/><br/>If you disagree with me and you think I'm a dummy, it's okay to say so. But I don't want this thread to turn into a bunch of personal attacks.

Sure, I design so people will play "my way" I guess. But, my way is deliberately collaborative among the group. In essence, my first two published games were designed as a direct challenge against illusionism and a support for appreciation of everyone's creative input, not just the GMs and maybe a loudmouth player.<br/><br/>MUCH more importantly, I don't buy it because this is a poor analogy. Assuming one thinks illusionism is pretty lousy (I do, personally), then there's an implicit criticism of how friends treat each other face-to-face. In essence, there's a lot of social, human-contact power dynamics going on, and not all of 'em good. <br/><br/>However, in designing games that get played, I just don't see that same thing going on. There are none of those same social, human-contact power dynamics. There may be other goofy things going on, but "Designer is God" is not one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127946/#Comment_127946" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T07:40:39+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  7:40AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a big request for questions like these: PLEASE BE SPECIFIC.

It's more like you have a scaffolding that determines what the shape and boundaries of your game are going to be. You can put whatever you want into the play of the game, and because that input is limited by the scaffolding you're driven into fruitful modes of play, without disagreement over setting, tone, theme, etc.<br/><br/>Do you see the difference?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127947/#Comment_127947" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T07:41:36+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  7:41AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 7:44AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, dummy, get off my lawn!<br/><br/>OK, it's actually a good point for discussion.

Signs up for Inspectres. He had the game, played it once or twice, and wanted to try it with strangers.<br/><br/>The GM, basically, bought Inspectres looking for a new version of "Ghostbusters RPG".<br/><br/>The GM planned the adventure from beginning to end. The players had no say in the mission (which is against the rules, the players are supposed to be able to narrate shit).<br/>They weren't allowed to roll their communual Library/Gym etc dice.<br/>The player asked about doing the Inspectres style (I forget the name of it) "Reflection Scene", the one where a player narrates the action like they were watching a video of it afterwards.  It's an awesome technique which basically really sets the tone of the game.<br/>The GM refused, saying "Those rules are <i>Gay</i>". <br/><br/>That's an extreme example, but there's been a lot of people who basically take a game, run it in some new (or old) way, have a terrible time, then blame the game for their experience.<br/><br/>There are some lessons to be learned:<br/>Don't play with shitbags; Play with friends.<br/>Convention play is a crapshoot; Instead organize friends and play regularly.<br/>Some folks will just fuck with the rules; it can't be avoided.<br/><br/>However, there's something to be said about, "If you find a formula for the game, that works like magic when you play it here, there and everywhere, then why not try to hard code that into the game"?<br/>Stuff like The Roach, The Shadow of Yesterday, In a Wicked Age, Dogs in the Vineyard (especially!) all do this sort of thing. Dread kinda does this with the Death Spiral, a little.<br/><br/>Personally, I like it. It's fresh. It gets me to run a roleplaying game in a new way. I also think that it's a fad.

In GR, you had a pre-determined series of missions that you had to undertake, and each mission was a nonlinear 'sandbox' in which the player could approach numerous objectives in countless ways (within the context of a special-forces team, of course; you couldn't attack with a magic sword or cast spells).<br/><br/>Have you heard of anyone tweaking the Grey Ranks rules?

Ron Edwards, IIRC, changed the way characters who've been written out of the story are treated.  I can think of other changes one could make, but of course I designed it to within an inch of its life and think it's pretty solid.  Changing tone is a social/group thing, because there's no expressed tone for play beyond "pretty serious".  I've talked to folks who've had very political games, very sex/romance oriented games, very fighty games.  Changing the setting is as easy as re-doing the chapter dates, writing new descriptions for each, and swapping out situation elements.  Berlin, 1945 would be easy.  Something in contemporary Africa could work but I don't really want to play either of those.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127990/#Comment_127990" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T09:30:41+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  9:30AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 12:41PM by PaulB.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Edited for obvious reasons.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127993/#Comment_127993" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T09:55:36+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  9:55AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a real rib-tickler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128038/#Comment_128038" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T11:10:13+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 11:10AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if there's any merit in the thought, that some designers want to help novice or inexperienced GMs start to get into the role comfortably through rules and stuff that helps create focus, so that in the long run they can be comfortable with running whatever they want with the "training wheels off"?

I like those rules, knowing that certain events are going to happen in an adventure, or that the adventure has a fixed structure, doesn't spoil it if I had a say in it and agree to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128103/#Comment_128103" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T13:42:41+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  1:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt's using "illusionism" because it's a specific phenomenon. "Railroading" is a local phenomenon. The problem with this discussion, and many like it, is that Railroading isn't defined well, and everybody is putting their own meaning on the term. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way that I've found to use "Railroading" successfully as a term is to have it mean, "The players aren't getting to be creative in play in the manner in which they expect." <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is because EVERY RPG has limits on it's content. And these are mostly agreed to by the players. You could agree to have somebody read you a novel, and call that RPG play if you wanted, and it's still not "railroading" in any useful sense, because everybody expects to have the novel read to them, and not participate creatively. D&amp;D is very tightly constrained in some ways, as is GURPS ("universal" my ass). All RPGs start out with a the set of infinite possibilities, and then constrain them some amount. Barring the absurd novel-reading example, even the most constrained of RPGs still has a subset of those infinite possibilities that is, itself, infinite. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only question is whether or not that set is agreed upon by the participants, and they enjoy that particular set of constraints. If some player is creating unagreed to constraints on participation, they are "railroading." If not, then they're just applying agreed to constraints, and that's how RPGs work. <br/>\n<br/>\n(In fact, I've often pondered if, in fact, this is the defining quality of RPGs, and what sets them apart from, say, wargames and reading novels). <br/>\n<br/>\nNow others may have some other definition of railroading that makes this discussion worthwhile, but if so they're going to have to make them clear. It seems to me that all RPGs have constraints and a tighter set does not constitute anything problematic to play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, this is a corrolary to the point I often make (Ron's point originally) that the GM doing his agreed to job is not railroading. That is, yes, the GM has some authority in the game, but there's nothing wrong with him using it in the agreed to manner. To, say, introduce an encounter in D&amp;D. The only time charges of railroading are leveled is when that encounter is introduced in order to force the players to go south to avoid it, so as to take away their potential decision to go north. See the difference? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf "railroading" isn't refering to something dysfunctional, I'm not sure what it's purpose is as a term. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131163/#Comment_131163" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T08:20:20+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  8:20AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Honestly?

Take DitV: the game is about sinnin' Mormons; the Town Creation explicitly builds a hierarchy of sin to be faced by the Dogs. Then, you start rolling dice. One could strip the setting (Western US Mormons), sure--happens all the time. And look at what ALSO happens, when folks start to setting-hack Dogs: they change the notion of "sin," "town," and sometimes escalation. Two of those elements are firmly embedded in system. But no one's built a crunchy, task-resolution, dungeon-crawl hack for Dogs because one must basically toss out the whole book (*ahem* ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a> being a notable exception-in-the-works).<br/><br/>Probably the only RPG that doesn't "railroad with system" is Universalis, mainly because you build almost everything from the ground up... even system elements (Gimmicks).

Something like:<br/><br/>Back in the day (and to this day with some backwards-thinking traditional-gaming throwbacks*), a GM would put together a game with his friends in order to share stuff he thought was cool.  He put a lot of work in compiling cool content, cool conflicts, cool house rules, and in general, a "way the game works" that he thought would be fun.  He then shared this with his friends, often like a sort of participatory art form: "here is my game; you play it, but it is still my game, and it is my artistic creation."  Much honor, respect, and hullabaloo was accorded the "good GM" who could put together a good game.<br/><br/>Now we have our brilliant and liberating indie games, which, generally speaking, take that GM role and toss it out the window -- pre-game prep is often replaced by in-game development, and the GM-as-director/players-as-actors thing is often replace with more equitable collaboration. (There are exceptions, of course, <em>Burning Wheel</em> especially.)  And lots of folks were happy and did a little dance because now everybody at the table helped create the art together, at the table.<br/><br/>BUT -- this still destroyed the niche of the creative GM sharing his cool game with his friends.  It's a rare thing in indieland to hear "Man, Jason is such an awesome GM!"  Lots of us have come from a gaming pedigree that honored and respected putting something together and sharing it with your friends -- for those of us who wanted to still do that, our go-to option has been dissolved.  Dissolved by games printed using new technology that makes it easier to create whole new games.  The easiest solution is to use the same techniques and technology to put together our own game, complete with all the stuff we thought is cool, complete with a "way the game works" that we think will be fun, and then package and print it up to share with our friends.<br/><br/>Tellingly, when somebody says "We played Jason's game and it rocked!" it's assumed they're referring to <em>Grey Ranks</em>, not some <em>TSOY</em> game that he put together and ran.  Moreover, the kudos and social respect that we give designers looks very similar to the social respect given on RPGnet to the guys who post running APs of the games they are running, or share some of their prep for the game they're about to run.<br/><br/>So no, I don't think it's off to suggest that GMs turn into designers in indieland.  The community is constituted in such a way that becoming a designer is the easiest way to get recognition and the easiest way to share creative, artistic work.  Are there other motives?  Sure.  It just strikes me that traddy GMs who put together a creative thing in order to share it with their friends and indie designers who... put together a creative thing in order to share it with their friends -- those are incredibly close motivations, and the "creative GM" is not a role that is commonly available in indieland.  No surprise that people who might otherwise seek that role turn to the closest alternative.<br/><br/>* Okay, maybe some fighting words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131179/#Comment_131179" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T09:09:17+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  9:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 9:10AM by Rafael.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite>some backwards-thinking traditional-gaming throwbacks</blockquote>\nWhoa!

Fascinating stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131310/#Comment_131310" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T13:27:47+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:27PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Josh is dead on right. I'll bet that 100% of "indie game designers" were once GMs who modified a game to work better for their needs. The motive is precisely the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not seeing the fist here, however. That is, some old-school GM's railroaded, some did not. But Paul Czege isn't railroading when he makes up MLWM. Again not unless you use a non-pejorative definition. He's constraining, sure (or suggesting to a group that they constrain themselves in a certain manner). But, again, all RPGs do this.
