After they had agreed to play the game at all, I asked them if they were interested in testing my idea for a pokemon/my-pet-monster inspired setting. They agreed to that as well.</blockquote>\nThere's a description of exactly what that entails at the end of the link.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we started late and we stopped for Game 2 (the more fools we), so we only got to run six scenes, including one fight, but I'm jazzed to resume next week, and the other two players claimed the same thing.<br/><br/>I'm go playing!  At last!  Wheee!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
