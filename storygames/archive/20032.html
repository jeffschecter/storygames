The rules in the hub and spokes are organized by topic, but I've found that when I'm in play, especially as a new player, I need to know what decisions and actions I can take at that given moment. So, I've condensed the rules and reorganized them according to time and from the perspective of the player. This way, when you're resolving a test, you can look through the guide to find the point that you're at, and any information about artha to spend, exceptions to account for, or just basic steps to follow will be right there. Hopefully this will make it easier to grok the system as a whole. It was definitely helpful for me.<br/><br/>However, I'm sure I've made some errors in there, so I'd like some more experienced eyes to look it over. The sentences in red are ones that I'm especially unsure about. <br/><br/>I'm also open to feedback on other information I should add. The sheet assumes that you've read the actual book, so it doesn't bother with definitions and things like that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442987/#Comment_442987" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T14:44:11+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  2:44PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a quick read it looks reasonably correct and might even be helpful.

I think there's some wiggle room there, it's not quite procedural. But it shouldn't really happen much that you go back and change things because of the consequences of failure.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, I feel like it's <i>really long</i>. I guess I internalize a lot of that, but I feel like some of it is optional and doesn't need to be checked every time you roll the dice. I'd probably freak a bit if someone showed me that and told me to consult the first two pages every time I rolled the dice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442996/#Comment_442996" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T17:29:01+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  5:29PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, after a second look, I agree with CarpeGuitarrem. I have a <i>lot</i> of experience teaching BW, including to people new to RPGs (my one-on-one campaign with a new player lasted around 50 sessions!), and I have to say this is simply Too Much. In particular, you should really separate out the GM-facing stuff from the player-facing. Also, you need to introduce the more advanced levels later or on a separate sheet. I've actually had some success just telling people what to mark for advancement for the first session or two, and then getting into detail about how advancement works when they get curious.<br/><br/>What players really need to know is: what base pool to roll, if they get any bonuses from FoRKing, Help, or simply good fictional positioning, and if they're spending any Artha either before or after the roll. Though I do like that you tell them their job is to fight for their Beliefs\u2014that's important!!! On the other hand, it's also good to tell them, hey, you know, it's also okay if mid-session you realize that the price is too high for one of your Beliefs and you end up betraying it. You get rewarded the same either way.<br/><br/>Setting the Ob and Failure consequences, handing out Artha, even going over emotional attributes and Steel\u2014that's all really for the GM to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442997/#Comment_442997" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T17:34:57+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  5:34PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Vm6lYhMlfA_oKPAqWIfiZAot3qNenu2Kutl8x0XFLU/" rel="nofollow">Here's mine</a>.
