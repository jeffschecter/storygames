The next time I played, we did the journal part willy-nilly. Including before and after the role play.<br/>\nI checked the rules and there are no clear guidelines on this. I am trying to figure out if one group gelled better than the other or the Journal is a distraction or..?<br/>\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342085/#Comment_342085" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-09T15:05:50+00:00" title="September  9, 2011  3:05PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I played, writing the Journal was the game, IIRC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342092/#Comment_342092" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-09T16:14:17+00:00" title="September  9, 2011  4:14PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ideally, the journal forces you to slow down enough to keep a sense of cohesion, and to recall what last happened to your pilgrim so you can build on that.<br/><br/>It was mentioned on another site that having someone other than the turn-taker write the sentence down is very helpful. Something that I don't think was discovered until after publication.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>we didn't touch the journal until we role played out what we were planning on writing</blockquote>\nThere could be the problem. If your group wants to play a role-playing game, Daniel's games that focus on story-writing may not be that group's cup of tea in that moment.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342237/#Comment_342237" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T11:05:39+00:00" title="September 11, 2011 11:05AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>When I played, writing the Journal was the game, IIRC.</blockquote>\nYeah, I thought that writing in the journal WAS the game. There's role-playing in it? Really? Where? I mean, I can just role-playing stuff around the edges of the game, but that didn't seem to be what the game was, from my reading of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
