                    So I had a go at the 24 Hour RPG thing, just to see if I could. And I sort of could, but the result needed a lot of tidying after the 24 hours were up. But now I have a <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/file.php?file_id=177" rel="nofollow">nice little game</a>, 6 pages including a 1-page character chart, and I'm wondering - how should I flesh this out? I know it <i>needs</i> fleshing out, because of Reeves-McMillan's Third Law* if nothing else. But by that same law, I don't know what else people would want to see explained and what they can work out for themselves.<br/><br/>I want to resist writing a specific setting for it, for a number of reasons: laziness, lack of ideas, a preference for "settings-agnostic" universal game systems, and the presence in this one of a method for involving the players in generating the setting using a separate "pre-game". That's not to say I can't give more hints about how to do a setting. I suspect that more hints on story structure might be another good area.<br/><br/>Suggestions of other topics I could productively cover in more depth welcomed, indeed, sought. Also any general critique and suggestions. And if anyone wanted to playtest it - gratitude!<br/><br/>It's GM-less and diceful - you hippies have corrupted me, when I first started hanging out here I was all about diceless and GM-full. :-} Ah well.<br/><br/>*"Fewer things are self-evident than I think."                </div>

                            I'd say the key thing missing is ties between the character generation and setting generation parts of the game. Make these work together organically and it should be cool. To me, they currently seem unconnected.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Mike. (Good to see some other Mikes among the Joshes and Freds and Tonys. We also seem to be unusually short of Daves and Andrews.)<br/><br/>How about if, once the setting generation was agreed to be "enough", another complete round of Open Questions was played with slightly different rules - the holder of the die would make a statement about his/her main character, and the other players in rotation would each ask an open question (as per die roll) about the character for the die holder to answer? Then the die passes to the next person, who does the same.                        </div>

                            Actually that gives me another idea - the whole Open Questions game could be played that way, someone introduces a feature of the setting and everyone else asks questions about it (rather than each person asking a question of the next one round the circle).<br/><br/>I might make it optional either way.                        </div>

                            Sorry, that's my possibly-not-so-cunning method of being able to charge for downloads (by checking using PHP, per file, whether free downloads are allowed or if you've paid). The file comes out of a database. It should work for everyone, in theory, but if people are having problems I've uploaded it <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Rule%20of%203.pdf" rel="nofollow">here as well</a>.<br/><br/>My further thoughts at the moment are:<br/><br/>- rename Motivations as Drivers, and make them complete dice (to encourage use of them and reflect their power).<br/>- revise the "dark points" mechanic so that ordinary points turn dark, or dark points turn ordinary, under defined circumstances.<br/><br/>I'll probably post a new version later today with those changes.                        </div>

                            OK, now updated, with the above changes plus more guidance for story creation and setting brainstorming (feel free to lift this, with attribution, for your own games if you like it). <br/><br/>It's now 10 pages - twice the original length! It's turning into a monster.<br/><br/>I'm not totally happy with the link attributes -&gt; background -&gt; skills; I'm thinking maybe skills come from attributes plus background, and background stands alone as the root of its own tree. Need to think about it some more.                        </div>

                            Apologies to all, I realized last night that the dice system in the current version makes <em>no mathematical sense whatsoever</em>. Hey, I'm an arts graduate. Sometimes it shows.<br/><br/>Plan for today (maybe going into tomorrow) is to restructure the dice thing completely. It will end up being based on a couple of P.D. Ouspensky/Gurdjieff concepts. You may not be able to see them, but they will be there. :-}                        </div>

                            OK, I'm serious this time. <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Rule%20of%203.pdf" rel="nofollow">Version 1.3</a> is up, thoroughly revised from earlier versions. It falls into several parts: <br/><br/>- Pages 1-3 outline the Open Questions minigame which generates the setting and characters. Others are free to use this. Attribution appreciated.<br/>- Pages 4-7 are on character creation. I've completely revised the character creation system and the character chart (p. 14). It has nine aspects (skills, equipment, training, "drivers", relationships, background, attributes, insights and knowledge) in a 3 x 3 grid. You can invest up to 2 points per element in a number of elements which fall within these aspects (i.e. specific skills, etc.). By combining 3 elements in permitted ways, you get a number to compare against a d6 roll. You have "dark points" as well as ordinary points, which have narrative and character-development consequences later on.<br/>- Pages 8-10 are on Story in general, and again, feel free to use it, expand it, suggest how I should expand it, etc. I lay out a 3-act structure with suggestions for ways the characters can meet, situations/dilemmas that might form the basis for the action, ways of escalating the plot, and possible resolutions. The resolutions section is very sketchy as yet - if anyone can suggest a resource I'd appreciate it.<br/>- Pages 11-12 are on the mechanics of challenges.<br/>- Page 13 is on character change, including a mechanism allowing for Redemption or Fall of characters under defined circumstances.<br/>- And page 14, as previously indicated, is the character chart.<br/><br/>Minimally formatted as yet, still with embryonic bits, but... I think to a point where I would like some serious critique. Is it playable? Would it attract you to play it? If not, why not? Which bits are non-obvious and need opening up? Like that.                        </div>
