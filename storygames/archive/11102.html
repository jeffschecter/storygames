Everway was mentioned as a "game I'll never play" and then a side discussion started, defending it. I made this thread for that discussion.<br/><br/>I can only speak for what happened when I played, although I don't imagine my experience was unique. The cards worked, more or less... the numbers didn't. I fight a monster. I have Fire 4/Earth 5 and it has Fire 4/Earth 5 (or whatever it was - it's been years); we fight forever and nothing happens. We couldn't make sense of the stats in the fiction, couldn't figure out how to make monsters, and couldn't figure out how to make fighting already-made monsters interesting. The only drift I can envision, beyond "don't fight monsters!", is to abandon the numbers entirely and consult the deck as an oracle, but then there's no good system for negotiating whether your interpretation or my different one goes into the fiction. So, Graham, my position is actually that Everway is doesn't work because it's a terrible, boring system that fundamentally fails at providing a framework for adding collaboratively to the fiction, beyond "cuz the gee-em sez", which is axiomatically awful, and because <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ihadabadgame&amp;Mode=like">#ihadabadgame</a>.

But that means that there's lots of room for people to get creative paralysis, and it puts a lot of pressure on the GM to get it right, be creative, acknowledge player input, and all that.<br/><br/>I'd say that the first step to running Everway in a fun and engaging way while still playing more-or-less by the rules-as-written would be to engage with the system on its own terms, rather than as a defective version of another game. So if I as the GM throw a monster at you, I have to know why it's there. If it's just there to be a brief moment of adversity, then it gets resolved Dramatically. "Here's a monster! It's big and scary! What do you do?" "I swing my sword!" "My God! You've cut its goddamn head off!"  Boom. Easy.<br/><br/>If, conversely, it's meant to be a significant part of the encounter, a true obstacle, then the player has to put in the effort to overcome the monster.<br/><br/>"I swing my sword!"<br/><br/>"Your sword rings off its scaly hide and it lunges forward! You are equally matched in strength and endurance with this thing! If you try to match it blow for blow, you may manage to kill it, but you'll be exhausted and easy prey for the next such mindless monstrosity to come along. What do you do?"<br/><br/>"I maneuver so that the pit is behind me and then, when it lunges forward, I leap out of the way, spin, and use my shield to push it into the pit!"<br/><br/>Here, at this point, the GM can either say, "My God! Its scream echoes for what seems like half an hour as it falls!" (Drama), compare Air scores or whatever to see which opponent is cleverer to justify saying "My God! Its scream echoes for what seems like half an hour as it falls!" (or "My God! You're too slow! Roll up a new character!"), or throw a card to shape the judgment. Suppose I throw "Nature (Life Energy)," which reminds me of the tenacity of life. If I'm the GM, I say, "My God! It's hanging by its claws from the lip of the pit! What do you do?"<br/><br/>And play proceeds from there.<br/><br/>The trick is that something needs to happen in play to provide sufficient narrative detail that in juxtaposition with the cards gives the interpreter something to work with. Neither is wholly effective by itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246651/#Comment_246651" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T15:47:39+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  3:47PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I nominate this thread for Best of Storygames?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246685/#Comment_246685" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T20:23:37+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  8:23PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2009 8:24PM by ccreitz.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>[...]everything is GM fiat (Drama) until the GM doesn't know what the hell is going to happen next[...]</blockquote> I have a problem with that. <i>Polaris</i> isn't that way, <i>Puppetland</i> isn't that way. Surely there must, in this swingin' multi-culti game, be a way for a player's contribution to be backed up with some Drama-derived authority other than GM fiat. I mean, consider:<br/><br/><i>Puppetland</i>: At chargen, I asserted a few facts about my puppet into the fiction ("This puppet can pull a rabbit out of her hat"). Twenty minutes later, I can say "Let me distract the wicked nutcracker by pulling a rabbit from my hat!" and I am right. That is so cool.<br/><br/><i>Call of Cthulhu</i>: At chargen, I asserted a few facts about my investigator into the fiction ("SIZ 18"). A few scenes later, I can say "There's no way I'm gettin' this wide load through that window" and I am right. Maybe we disagree about the relative contributions of my height and my mass to that SIZ stat, but I feel pretty certain that no one will challenge my claim about how much ass my guy is hauling around the game world.<br/><br/><i>Fiasco</i>: I chose to resolve my scene. Y'all get to tell me how it's set up and I have no say; the rules tell us y'all are right. Then I say how it ends and y'all have no say; the rules reserve that right to me. Drama is all there is.<br/><br/>Help me do something, as a player, with Drama resolution, since Karma is unhelpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246686/#Comment_246686" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T20:40:18+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  8:40PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could be that Everway is just not your game.

But a lot of people still accept the GM-controls-the-world, player-controls-the-character dichotomy as just how it is--even when that's not exactly true--and it doesn't surprise me that this early 90s game doesn't challenge it. But it's <i>playable</i>.<br/><br/>But it's easy to hack, I think. It depends on what you want to do. If you want to totally forgo the "We follow the GM's plot" route, you could give each player a hand of those Vision cards and go around the table, with each player getting a chance to throw a Vision card and use it to start the next scene, describing  the characters entrance upon the scene. The GM then takes over and uses the rules to tell the players what happens to them, soliciting their further input as needed to keep things interesting, as described above. There's probably some mechanism through which the players assign Karma scores to the scene as a whole, with higher assigned values producing a higher reward--perhaps you have to beat X points worth of opposition before you're allowed to achieve a notable objective, gain advancement points, or what have you.<br/><br/>That's the heart of how I'd do it, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246694/#Comment_246694" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T21:57:16+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  9:57PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My God!

All of that falls under "needs of the story." But notice how it's always co-constructed by player and GM. A generic model looks like this: (1) GM highlights situation elements (some of which have been introduced by player), (2) player acts on behalf of character in response to situation, (3) player and GM consult the system to resolve the action, and (4) the output of the resolution provides new situation elements, and (5) the cycle continues.<br/><br/>I should note that my game <i>Ganakagok</i> resembles <i>Everway</i> in its reliance upon an oracular tarot for resolving actions, but <i>Ganakagok</i> has an explicit and extensive game-mechanic for awarding the right to interpret the card. This mechanic draws out step 3 so that everyone at the table can potentially intervene in the on-going action to shape the resolution.<br/><br/>But of course that's not a complete model; it just covers action resolution. There are other ways of introducing elements of the situation; Colin's examples of asserting facts about his character underscores the point that character generation is one of those ways. <i>Everway's</i> Vision cards provide another technique for this: they have pictures on one side and a set of questions about the picture on the other. I can imagine a game where <i>as a group</i> you pulled a card and answered the questions about it to create the starting situation, gave players each a card to come up with their character (per the rules), and then started play from there, without any need for the GM to "come up with an adventure" or any of that bullshit. You would just respond to character initiatives.<br/><br/>So one of the things I'd do to update <i>Everway</i> is build in collaborative situation generation. Easy. I'd also like a GM budget for adversity or some other mechanism for putting limits on my ability to just throw shit in your way until I thought you'd had enough, because I'm a wimp and would go easy on you. A pacing mechanism for the narrative, a la <i>Inspectres</i>, or maybe just a tool for ending an adventure and seeing what the consequences were.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246792/#Comment_246792" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T09:05:56+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  9:05AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, Drama resolution can also involve consensus building among the group about what should happen next.  Like, when I was running Danger Patrol the other day, something happened and I -- as GM -- narrated a fictional consequence: "So what if the dark portal's energy has leaked into the bodies of the lava fish, turning them into voidsharks?"  And John said: "Okay..." and I read this as skepticism and said: "Is that not cool?" and he said something like: "No, that's totally cool. I'll never reject voidsharks."  Basically I was checking t make sure that the other players thought that voidsharks made sense in the story (since that was a pure Drama resolution decision on my part), that I wasn't taking the gonzo past the point where nobody could be invested in the fiction anymore (since that happened to some players when I ran Danger Patrol before).<br/><br/>You can also have Drama resolution in which the other players say "Yes, but" as in Polaris or in more informal ways.  Like if John had said: "Okay, but the dark portal has actually turned into a giant voidshark itself and spawned pups" or whatever, that's still part of Drama resolution but takes it beyond a decision made by a single player.  You even get this kind of thing in Fortune / Karma resolution when players say: "Can I fork in my Tracking skill?" or "Don't I get an additional +2 for Underwater Combat?" or whatever.  It just takes a different form in Drama resolution.<br/><br/>So don't necessarily fall for Everway's GM-centric approach to resolution.  You can definitely inject some dirty hippiness into that and share control of resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246813/#Comment_246813" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T10:10:25+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 10:10AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaywalt</cite>In my experience, Drama resolution can also involve consensus building among the group about what should happen next.  </blockquote>\nYes, absolutely. Of course, it's worth it to distinguish between the "problem-solving" or inventional side of Drama resolution ("What <i>could</i> happen here?") and the the "decision-making" or deliberative piece ("What <i>actually does</i> happen here?"). A good DM (i.e., Decision-Maker) is always <i>listening hard</i> to get a sense of the fictional possibilities that intrigue the players most. Then your system tells you how to decide among those fictional possibilities, and negotiating-to-consensus is absolutely a legitimate way to do that. It's also a particularly fragile one (i.e., easy to break, game, or manipulate), and one that seldom leads to surprising or unexpected results. Which may be what you want, depending on the game or sub-system of the game you're in.<br/><br/>So formal techniques for managing Drama, as in <i>Polaris</i>, strike me as good and interesting design, because they make the thing that's going to happen anyway a part of play rather than an obstacle to it. You could do something like that in <i>Everway</i>, too, where you let other players offer suggestions about what could happen and the GM gets to decide which one happens (or vice versa).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246825/#Comment_246825" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T10:44:09+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 10:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>The Drama resolution comes from me consulting "the needs of the story" and deciding what happens based on that.</blockquote>This.

I don't think anything I'm suggesting is controversial. The informal negotiation that you describe I think of as belonging to the inventional part of dramaturgical play. But pinning down the circumstances under which someone has an authoritative veto over the contributions of someone else isn't easy to formalize. For every gonzo-tastic Danger Patrol game, there's a Capes game where someone went just a little bit too far. So you're relying to a great extent on the shared preferences of the players at the table--the culture of play, if you will--and when those don't mesh, the solidarity of the group at the table and the coherence of the in-game fiction can suffer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246919/#Comment_246919" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T14:41:29+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  2:41PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran <i>Everway</i> for a pretty long time. 30 sessions? Maybe something like that.<br/><br/>I did what the book says to do regarding resolution (drama/karma/fortune, pick and mix to taste) and it worked great for us.<br/><br/>Let's say we have the 5/4 PC vs. the 4/5 Demon. According to the numbers, the fight is a stalemate. Except we're not comparing numbers, we're playing a roleplaying game. Our characters go into action and someone (the GM by default here) makes a judgment. Is the PC being all ass-kicky against the demon? Cool, that's Fire, yep. Is the PC just trying to hurt the demon? Okay, Fire vs. Earth and... yeah, a 5-5 tie.<br/><br/>"You smash the demon with a spinning kick, and your foot bounces off like you just kicked a stone wall."<br/><br/>The player, at this point, never, ever says "I kick it again." Clearly, the demon is too tough. The karma resolution has told us that, all things being equal, this character can't hurt this demon with brute force alone. Time to try to maneuver it into falling into the magical vortex, or maybe go grab that weird looking spear you saw in the throne room, or... whatever. The player does something to change the situation and try to get an advantage. Which puts us back into the freeplay + karma/drama/fortune cycle.<br/><br/>Or maybe the player just comes up with some crazy awesome move that no one knows how to deal with. I usually go for a card draw at that point, then lay the card out on the table and "interpret" it out loud, which usually means the players jump in with their own ideas. "The picture shows a demon-looking thing dying. Come on! That is too perfect."<br/><br/>Dang, I have to run.

There was so much material in those, I never came close to using it all. The general deal was: There are many spheres in danger, the ones you care about saving are the ones in your character's card-stories. We're gonna go save them.<br/><br/>Colin:<br/><br/>1) This does not seem like a serious question. 9001? Pffft. The game has a guide that tells you what the numbers mean. You pick numbers for things according to that guide.<br/><br/>2) Eh? It's a roleplaying game, right? No one says, "I Fire up that demon." What does your character do? What's the situation? Based on those <i>very specific things in the present fictional moment</i>, the GM decides which resolution to use (D/K/F) and then says the result of the action. Fire 6 guy says, "I kick the demon in his stupid demon face." I look at the numbers and see a clear winner. "You smash his stupid face real good. Black demon blood flies everywhere and the creature howls in pain. It's clutching its face and sort of half crawling around on the floor, blood everywhere." The situation has changed, more actions happen, and so on.<br/><br/>2b) (Because someone will ask) The demon isn't instantly defeated because I decided to use Karma as my guide this time and the PC is only 1 point higher. So it's a decisive blow, but the demon is still alive; still a potential threat. That's how I chose to interpret the resolution for this specific moment. "1 point higher means you wound them" is not a hard rule. Everway GMing is about judgment calls like this.<br/><br/>3) Yeah, the GM said there was a crazy huge god-killing spear hanging in the throne room when the PCs were in there earlier. The PCs are in the abandoned keep of an ancient hero of legend, so you'd expect to see stuff like that. The GM says what's in the world around the characters. How is that a sucky thing? That's like every game ever.<br/><br/>4) If you don't agree about the interpretation of a card, you discuss it like adults. The GM has final say. If that causes strife, either don't show the fortune cards to the group (just look at them yourself and cock an eyebrow dramatically), draw a new card, or play with different people who aren't dicks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246978/#Comment_246978" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T18:32:01+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  6:32PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2009 6:34PM by komradebob.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>4) If you don't agree about the interpretation of a card, you discuss it like adults.

Pffft. The game has a guide that tells you what the numbers mean. You pick numbers for things according to that guide.</blockquote>\nSorry, I was just being hyperbolic with 9001. It was a serious question. Why 4/5 and not 3/4 or (say) 6/6? This goes to the heart of my problem with the Karma system: what constrains the GM in making his guys? What do those numbers mean in the fiction, especially for non-human characters? As the GM, knowing that my sole PC has 5/4, what does my choice among 3/4 (no challenge), 4/5 (no progress), and 6/6 (no chance) actually come down to?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><br/>3) Yeah, the GM said there was a crazy huge god-killing spear hanging in the throne room when the PCs were in there earlier. The PCs are in the abandoned keep of an ancient hero of legend, so you'd expect to see stuff like that. The GM says what's in the world around the characters. How is that a sucky thing? That's like every game ever.</blockquote> It's not every game ever. You've designed at least one game that isn't like that! I guess I mean that I am still trying to get over the incongruity of <i>Everway's</i> press releases, describing it as innovative, when compared to the reality of the game, which, as far as I can tell, is that it's a railroad-y trad game with pretty pictures.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Adventure prep came from the picture cards the players used to form the stories of their PCs. There was so much material in those, I never came close to using it all. The general deal was: There are many spheres in danger, the ones you care about saving are the ones in your character's card-stories. We're gonna go save them.</blockquote> This is what I wanted all of <i>Everway</i> to be, sort of the anti-D&amp;D. Player-driven, focused on the images on the cards, no THAC0. And I guess I see a way to make it the game I want it to be. As the GM, I need to treat those chargen stories as big flag-complexes. I need to fish relentlessly, maybe using the cards as prompts ("OK, you break into the tomb and... hm, what's this thrashing demon-thing? What do you see? What do you do?"). When I do that, I need to designate one person as the answerer and make sure they know they're right. In the <i>Everway</i> I always wanted to play, it was a non-GM player who put that crazy huge god-killing spear in the fiction.  <br/><br/>I don't know why I'm having trouble coming to terms with the fact that my dream <i>Everway</i> isn't in that white box, and that I'm just going to have to drift, and that's OK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247113/#Comment_247113" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T12:12:16+00:00" title="December 16, 2009 12:12PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite><br/>I don't know why I'm having trouble coming to terms with the fact that my dream<i>Everway</i>isn't in that white box, and that I'm just going to have to drift, and that's OK.</blockquote>\nIt sounds like John's saying that most of your dream is there.<br/>As an Everway GM, give your players lots of authority, use The Mountain Witch trick, and occasionally turn card interpretation over to another player.<br/>Done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247190/#Comment_247190" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T16:31:00+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  4:31PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>As the GM, knowing that my sole PC has 5/4, what does my choice among 3/4 (no challenge), 4/5 (no progress), and 6/6 (no chance) actually come down to?</blockquote>\nHow tough is the demon? Make the numbers reflect that. If you approach it like, "How hard should I make this next challenge?" then you've gone off in the wrong direction. Everway isn't a step-on-up kind of game.<br/><br/>Your synopses above (no challenge, no progress, no chance) are way, way off the mark as far as playing Everway goes. Like I said in my other post, the game play is about actions and consequences in the present moment of the fiction. There isn't any "no progress" number you can assign to anything. The element numbers aren't monster stat blocks that you play War with. I think this disconnect is at the heart of why Everway has been tough for you.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>it's a railroad-y trad game with pretty pictures.</blockquote>\nThis bewilders me. Railroad-y? Because the GM says what's in the world around the characters? I'm confused how you came to that conclusion. All of my Everway games were as far away from railroady as it's possible to get. The players decided what every single adventure was about, why it mattered to them, and how they went about it. I think maybe we're not understanding each other somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling" title="Maltese_Changeling"><img alt="Maltese_Changeling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling">Maltese_Changeling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247197/#Comment_247197" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T17:15:22+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  5:15PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are three sets of comments on how to stat up opponents from my <a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/rwb/www/gaming/everweb/" rel="nofollow">Everweb</a> site:<br/><br/><a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/rwb/www/gaming/everweb/monster2.html" rel="nofollow">Geoff Grabowski on Scores for Creatures</a><br/><a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/rwb/www/gaming/everweb/monster3.html" rel="nofollow">Jim Henley on Scores for Creatures</a><br/><a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/rwb/www/gaming/everweb/monster4.html" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Tweet on Scores for Creatures</a><br/><br/>These comments essentially say what John says in his latest post.<br/><br/>(BTW, this thread is making me think about trying to get my <i>Everway</i> game going again.
