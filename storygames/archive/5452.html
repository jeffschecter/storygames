Again, it rocked.  With no prep.<br/><br/>In 2 hours, again, we made characters and told a cool story with them.  The thieves stole the lord's gold, turned on each other and got caught, and killed.  The demon ate the plague victims and has infiltrated the lord's inner circle, and the operator of the wayhouse is just happy to have the thieves all dead, no one asking what happened to the dog.<br/><br/>That's my third game of IAWA and the game freaking delivers.  I REALLY want to see what the game is like when the players know the rules.  One of these times I'll run it with repeat players, and that will rock too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122287/#Comment_122287" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T06:28:25+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  6:28AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, was there anything that particularly helped getting it going/done in 2 hours?  <br/><br/>I want to pitch IAWA to my regular group (5 players) as the "alternative option" when we're down to 2-3 and they don't want to risk themselves in the standard D&amp;D game, creating a cheat sheet of PC-sheet with key rules imbedded, for a 2-3 hour game likely.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122288/#Comment_122288" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T06:43:47+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  6:43AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want it to run in 2 hours, all told (including character creation) then I would say<br/><br/>1) Ask that all PC best interests are clear attacks on the best interests of other characters (PC or NPC).  Usually this is a good guideline anyway but allow no exceptions.<br/>2) Limit the number of NPCs - basically try not to go too far afield for "implied characters"<br/>3) Establish that all PCs are somewhere within a 1 mile radius of X doing their thing RIGHT away.<br/>4) Frame scenes with multiple PCs right away, and try to keep doing that throughout the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122367/#Comment_122367" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T11:22:02+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 11:22AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, Ryan.

The oracles we obtained made us very fecund with character ideas. Like, we came up with about 10-15 for a 3-player, 1-GM game.<br/><br/>Question 1: How many NPCs does the GM select if there is an untenably large number to choose from after the brainstorming session?<br/><br/>Anyway, I picked 5, completely arbitrarily. We fussed with them and then the time came to set best interests.<br/><br/>I pick one of my strongest NPCs, well and good. I name two best interests for them. All righty. We go around the table once, now everyone's PC has 1 best interest, one of my NPCs has 2 and another has 1.  We go around the table again and everyone's PC has 2 best interests, one of my NPCs has 2, 2 more have 1, and another 2 have 0.  <br/><br/>Question 2: Do I just fill in the remaining best interests or discard the NPCs? (What if they are targetted by PCs?)  If I fill in the remaining best interests, how many do I fill in? Do I "fill up" to 2 or just 1?<br/><br/>This was a little puzzling because the text made it seem like we could go around and around the table, when really there would only ever be two rounds of best-interests-naming because the PCs could only ever have 2 best interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122467/#Comment_122467" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T14:49:37+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  2:49PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

NPCs need at least 1 each and PCs need 2.<br/><br/>2.  It's not rounds in a circle - it can be done in any order.  I.e. GM does 2 for an NPC, asks player to do 1.  GM does 1 each for 2 NPCs, asks another player to do 1.  Another player bursts in with his 2.  GM writes another 3 NPCs' Best Interests, asks next player to do 1.

Two is usually plenty for me. Ruthlessly cut or ignore other characters from your list. Or, better still, don't start out with a 15 character list. Reign it in. Pull maybe... 6 or 7 tops from the oracles. Don't go crazy just because you can.<br/><br/>Also, a general point: When you play Wicked, try to get to a point where you can play a chapter in an hour (it takes a little practice, but it's easy after that). Then always, always play at least two chapters in a session. The game is way good like that. Trying to have short chapters is good for the type of stories Wicked makes (short little chapters of a longer thing) and getting to interact with the We Owe list over multiple chapters  in an evening makes the system kick more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122570/#Comment_122570" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T21:21:35+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  9:21PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I definitely saw that happen...my understanding of the character generation process is that it goes brainstorm-then-choose, so that's what we did.

None of the others have read the rules or played any story games before, so I am keen on tips for presenting it to people.<br/><br/>How much of the rules do you discuss in advance?
