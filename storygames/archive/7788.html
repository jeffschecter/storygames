Do not shoehorn characters into a setting; instead, fill setting into the cracks between the characters.<br/><br/>Okay, so the Forgotten Realms setting book for D&amp;D 4e is absolutely amazing. I, of course, was never going to even crack the cover. Then this enthusiastic store owner told me a few things about it and convinced me to take just a quick peek. I ended up reading the first 10 pages on the spot.<br/>Here's why:<br/><br/>The book opens with an encounter. Page 1 is an encounter where goblins are smashing through the town wall, or something. there's an encounter map on the very first page of the campaign world book. Once you finish that encounter, you flip the page and there's a two page spread about the village you're in. Another few encounters place you at the region-level. It slowly lets the characters stumble into a sprawling and heavily-detailed world.<br/><br/>But it starts with a single encounter.<br/><br/>So, here's this idea, which has nothing to do with D&amp;D:<br/>You start with a single encounter. Let it grow into a village. Let it grow into some story seeds, which in turn grow into a region. Let the campaign expand until you are at the foothills of the God Pillar. Then stop. Throw out your characters.<br/><br/>Make new characters. You start in a new place, with a single encounter. Let that segue into a description of the wilderness your characters find themselves stuck in. Let them explore and encounter a wise general who is preparing to raid an enemy village. The characters decide to join him. They storm the village, and as the GM is describing the raid the players suddenly realize that it's the same village as in the first campaign. Raze the village. The general decides to storm the God Pillars. He reaches the foothills of the God Pillar. Stop. Throw out the characters.<br/><br/>Make new characters. Narrate them being at the royal court, being tasked with the dangerous job of protecting the God Pillar from power-hungry vagabonds and a lunatic warband. Let this storyline slowly grow as you explore what exactly the God Pillar is. At some point stop.<br/><br/>Make new characters. Start with an encounter. Slowly zoom out, to the Haunting Jungles. Go exploring. See something new. More encounters. More exploring. More zooming and panning. Encounter an ex-general, the last survivor of a tragic defeat at the hands of the Royal Pillar Guard. At some point stop.<br/><br/>My point being that overarching settings are boring, on some level.<br/>What would be far cooler is if you found a way to never reach the overarching settings level, but still got the sense of "this world is coming to life through the exploits of my character!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172749/#Comment_172749" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T04:42:06+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  4:42AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds really cool, Joe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast" title="Radaghast"><img alt="Radaghast" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/252/nT6IX77SIXBAG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast">Radaghast</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172759/#Comment_172759" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T06:15:37+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  6:15AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm planning a campaign (not sure yet whether it's gonna have its own system) for playing Orcs, or Goblinoids to be precise, in a fantasy setting where all orcs, goblins, ogres, orogs, etc, are actually the same mutating race. The core principle is that if a goblinoid dies, he'll meet the Orc Deity to be judged for his life... and immediately granted a new one with a boosted body if he was "good" (in orcish terms) or a weakened one if he was "bad". Most of the memories is lost, but the "karmic" line is never cut.<br/><br/>Me and my regular gaming pals are all fans of long games, so I know this is gonna wither quicker than anything if I decide to keep it down to small scenes/modules. On the other hand, I definitely don't want it to turn eventually into a strategic game (what you call "overarching"), it doesn't feel right for this game, which should be more of a "shut up, I'm one foot taller than you!" and less of a "ok, let's look at this map and plan where our 1000 warriors should stand". So, I also came up with a solution very similar to yours: we're gonna have strictly one-session characters.<br/><br/>Every game will start with fast chargen and a battle encounter and continue with what you call zooming out. Shall a character live to the end of the session, the player will just narrate how the rest of his short life is gonna be like. The next session will start with chargen again, with the new characters somehow linked to the previous ones ("I'm Uub's grandson who was influenced by hearing many stories of him and now wants to prove he can be just as brave", with a hidden presupposition that this new character's soul is actually the same as Uub's).<br/><br/>So, yeah. In general I don't agree at all with the "all overarching settings are boring" statement, but this is an example of where I would (will) use your way of thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172769/#Comment_172769" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T07:05:27+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  7:05AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Radaghast,<br/><br/>That whole premise sounds just totally amazing.  From the cycle of reincarnation to having all sessions be about one character's actions and that's it.<br/><br/>I would really suggest just making the "hidden presupposition" explicit.  You have a really cool conceit and I'm thinking, "Why not drive all the way with it?"  Anyone who keeps their PC alive to the end gets narrative a "good" or "bad" death, and reap the benefits of that.<br/><br/><br/>Joe,<br/><br/>I'm within you on your points. It's funny.  I'm starting up a Traveller game with my players.  And for those of you who don't know, the first thing you do as a Traveller GM is roll up a few subsector maps, roll up about 150 worlds, and start imagining all the cool things that can happen all over the place.<br/><br/>But not this time.  My tastes and instincts are the same as yours, now.  So all I've created is one subsector, and only rolled one world, and defined three others, and that's it.  I have a background history for the subsector but it's loose and doesn't define all the worlds. At all.  When I was done I looked at my notes and thought, "This isn't Traveller!  This is a large valley in Glorantha ready for strife!"  I've set up a ton of conflict via politics, war, society and religion.  How it all plays out and what new details get added on the remaining 25 worlds in this subsector and the 100 worlds around it remain to be filled in as the characters take action. <br/><br/>I think The Big Campaign sounds cool... but I also see a ton of pitfalls in terms of management and constraint that I saw occur back in college when my gaming club did something similar.  A focus on all the world building often puts PCs on the backburner.  Of course, <i>my</i> idea of fun is the PCs, their choices, and extending world creation to focus on what these PCs need for their stories.  So I'm seeing this from a narrow perspective.<br/><br/><br/>Jason, <br/><br/>I'm intrigued with Joe's suggestion for your project.  Is it possible that each group starts with their own little patch, without fretting yet which areas are close to which areas?  That is, someone is playing in the Land of Blah, Blah, Blah, and another group is in Empire X.  The group in Empire X sees the notes on Blah, Blah, Blah and goes, "Hey! Cool!  Let's go there!"  And in the travel to Empire X we find out if the distance is great or small?  Thus, the reality is concocted in a looser, more Character driven fashion?<br/><br/>Just a thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172771/#Comment_172771" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T07:08:54+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  7:08AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a good thought.

Cartography Skills!  Hard to resist!  I mean this absolutely sincerely.  Maps!  We are people who love maps!  <br/><br/>We did character creation for the Traveller game on Sunday, and I spent Monday and Tuesday in pure hell looking at all the cool version of the GDW Third Imperium (if you haven't seen this, you MUST: <a href="http://www.travellermap.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.travellermap.com/</a> .  You can PLAY with it!!!!)  I wanted to build my own Interstellar empire of several thousand worlds --<i> right then and there!</i>  But I knew from lots of experience, probably not the best way to move forward in terms of play as social activity with my <i>players</i>!  <br/><br/>So, yeah.  I get it.  I let me steam off by grabbing one area and mapping it.<br/><br/>Is it possible Tony can do beautiful maps of "The Such-and-Such Valley"?  and "The Onerous Waselands" and so on?  On a smaller scale?<br/><br/>I'm <i>only</i> hitting this point because I've learned the hard way that in terms of structuring a social activity, what <i>works</i> is one thing, and what seems like the coolest idea in the world at the time is some times another.  (If you've never hung out on Traveller boards, they're fascinating.  I never have until recently.  They are filled with people tinkering with the Imperium: the logic if it, the reality of it, the implications of this to that.... I seldom see anyone talk about the PCs.  The hobby is the <i>setting</i>, not the play.  I think this is symptomatic of a certain approach to world building.)<br/><br/>If the project is to build a really fucking cool fictional world before play even has to begin, you guys will rock no matter what. But if it is to build an interlocking series of cool roleplaying experiences, you guys will also rock.  But, from my own experiences and practical application of what I've learned over the years, I'm not sure how viable doing both at the same time is going to be!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172827/#Comment_172827" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T09:58:16+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  9:58AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm getting really keen, lately, on designing maps as playgrounds. Instead of it being all like, "Here's the Western Empire and there are the Really Tall Mountains, which were crossed for the last time 300 years ago...", it's more like "Let's put a bunch of things we'd like our characters to interact with on a piece of paper". Which kind of requires the map to be on the same scale as the character's scope of ability/power.<br/><br/>Doing a bunch of such smaller-scale maps, and letting them be used for different adventures, would be very cool. Kind of like the "How to Host a Dungeon" game, but each "turn" actually takes a session of an rpg.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172868/#Comment_172868" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T11:43:40+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 11:43AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Which kind of requires the map to be on the same scale as the character's scope of ability/power.</blockquote>\nI like the way this is articulated.<br/><br/>This is making me think about really cool, really abstract stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
