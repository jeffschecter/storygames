In part because all of the one's I found seemed to thrive on complexity <i>(something about the sci-fi fans maybe?)</i> So what I have made here keeps the thematic, fun, theatre-of-the-mind aspects of Monster of the Week, but <b>IN SPACE!</b><br/><br/>-Playbooks work the same, single page, little to no cross referencing. (Now there just sci-fi)<br/>-Very few new rules. (Just sci-fi-ified)<br/>-System is generalized, meant to stretch to fit many different types of sci-fi stories<br/><br/><b>But what is it then?</b><br/>Play as your favorite gritty space traveling archetype, trying to make your way through a harsh universe. Inspiration includes the dirty feel of <i>Alien</i> and <i>Firefly</i>, the adventure of <i>Farscape</i> and <i>Stargate SG1</i>, and a little of the exploration in<i>startrek</i>. More gritty than space opera-y.<br/><br/>\n<h4>BREAKDOWN</h4>\nHere are some of the changes and or concepts I've introduced in this game<br/><br/>General theme<br/> -Futuristic, but familar, not far-fetched<br/> -Gritty, or at the very least like the universe is a hard to live in place<br/>   -Resources are more available in civilized places but so is bureaucracy and rule of law<br/>   -Space travel sucks (for the characters), <br/>     -loooooooong flight times, extended cold-sleep, families and friends dead<br/>     -Crappy backwards planets <br/><i>(I said all that but I still made the system flexible enough that you can disregard notes on theme)</i><br/><br/>STATS<br/> -Weird changed to WILL<br/> -No stat lines, just pick one each<br/><br/>Basic Moves<br/> -Re-skinned and renamed (like every hack)<br/> -Will Moves added<br/>   -keep acting when dying<br/>   -Resist character flaws/environmental harm <br/><br/>New Classes:<br/> -Some of the same material in new configurations<br/> -Brand new material<br/>   -Each class has some version of a flaw built in<br/>   -Thematic science fiction/modern archetypes from films/tv/video games<br/><br/>New history System<br/> -A player picks a role, leader, follower, expert, paramour..etc<br/> -Then a player picks two other players, one that likes that role, another that hates it<br/><br/>New fatigue system (replaces luck)<br/> -A replenishable pool of points available to all characters <br/> -Represents exhaustion/stamina and environmental harm/shock<br/> -Can be used to modify dice rolls<br/> -As fatigue is spent, character flaws come into play <br/> -Acting out character flaws replenish some fatigue <br/><br/>Assets<br/> -Stuff has been pulled out of most of the classes and put on a separate sheet<br/> -This includes rooms, workshops, teams (gangs), bases (hard holdings)<br/> -Players can choose assets instead in place of a new move when they level up<br/><br/>Gear<br/> -Players pick a kit and an extra or two kits<br/> -A kit has whatever would make sense for that category<br/> -Kits suggestions listed under gear reference, but otherwise players can establish on the go<br/><br/>Station moves<br/> -My attempt to hack a catch all for beginning session moves and Space ship battle stations<br/> -Can also be used to encourage players to help worldbuild<br/><br/>So this hack/conversion/re-skin needs too be looked over as I move into more to actual play. I promise the move descriptions are fun to read at least. Also I guess I'm wondering if anyone else wanted something like this.<br/><br/><a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuxPp1f9zqBth0xe7QvZ4Jxmqt9m" rel="nofollow"><b>Here are the Files again</b></a>, thoughts on changes, mechanics or general comments welcome. <br/><br/>***<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6V1QEnf-U00aHhTMnhsY2ozTU0/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Updated basic moves Sheet</a>***                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455105/#Comment_455105" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-15T06:04:15+00:00" title="July 15, 2016  6:04AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, here's my take, after skimming your post and the linked files:<br/><br/>First of all, I love the design of the files.

That strikes me as a bit odd in a spacefaring setting, but maybe it's a conscious design choice.</blockquote>\nYes and no, I was going for familiar vs fantastical (far future), I had planned to generalize the weapons, but I got somewhat stalled. On the Gear page it has a little bit about "calling them rayguns, if thats what you want." \n<blockquote><br/>The distinctions between some moves, and the precise natures of some moves, might come across as unclear.

Not to mention another user mentioned that I could possibly get rid of defend entirely, which I think I might. My design decisions in these names was just meant to simplify, I'm not sure that is the case, <br/><br/>As for investigate, I think I need to better differentiate it from the perceive move. Perceive is meant to be in the moment what jumps out to you, while investigate is an action over time, Its supposed to be both an opportunity for worldbuilding as well as represent a devoted effort somewhat off screen effort. <br/><br/>Use tech (never could I ever think of a better name) and technobable are just like Monster of the week,  Technobable is simply a multistep extension of use tech. But l like with your other suggestions I think it would be good to look them over with fresh eyes.\n<blockquote><br/>The condensed GM reference looks like a great cheat sheet for semi-experienced PbtA MCs.<br/><br/>I can see the utility of the roles system for getting players on the same team in the first place, and I like that it's not the FATE phase trio.

I think there could be something I could add in regards to ongoing relationships. Great point.\n<blockquote><br/>The fatigue mechanic seems mildly confused \u2013 you say it represents exhaustion/stamina and environmental harm/shock, which leads to giving in to character flaws, which makes sense, but then giving in to those flaws replenishes fatigue?

But also just house rule stuff where players get rewarded by role playing character traits. It definitely needs playtesting.\n<blockquote><br/>Overall, apart from the moves, I think it looks relatively easy to pick up and play, and it's built on some tested-and-true core mechanics.

Contrast this with 5e skill checks \u2013 if you're not sure whether an action should be modeled as Acrobatics versus Athletics, or Investigation versus Perception, it hardly matters which one you choose, since the stakes are the same in either case. "I'll let you roll either" is something I commonly hear in 5e and Pathfinder games.<br/><br/>With regard to fatigue, fate points, and inspiration, I should disclaim that I'm personally suspicious of these and practically any other system element that rewards role-playing in terms of game mechanics. But the fact that I just named three popular systems that use such mechanics probably indicates that plenty of people out there would disagree with me <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455119/#Comment_455119" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-15T20:29:22+00:00" title="July 15, 2016  8:29PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am, as you might imagine a fan of them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> That being said, I was attempting to create an elegant way to have it AND do other stuff, hence the tired/flaw mechanic.

It just doesn't fit honestly. <br/><br/>Thank you for your interest and I hope to post the new version, incorporating all the feedback soon!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461641/#Comment_461641" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T01:25:20+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  1:25AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2017 1:29AM by Kenny_J.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been quiet for some time, but I'm back and have been working hard on incorporating your feedback and the feedback from playtesting. I still have a lot to go but here is the new <b>basic moves sheet</b>! Your thoughts and critiques welcome. <br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6V1QEnf-U00aHhTMnhsY2ozTU0/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">UPDATED BASIC MOVES</a>\n<blockquote>Summary:<br/>-Moved to 6 stats. Alert, Bold, Calm, Sly, Smart, Weird. <br/>-Significantly cut down on moves, 6ish basic, and 4ish peripheral (you'll see what I mean by ish)<br/>-Re-named moves, more traditional, less confusing<br/>-Abolished Use tech, replaced it with something way shorter/simpler<br/>-Trimmed down battle, generalized choices<br/>-Re-worked the perceive stuff, more general.<br/>-Re-worked Stamina (also renamed fatigue to stamina)<br/>-A lot cleaner, and more straightforward.   <br/></blockquote>\nMore design and formatting is still to come, and I'm sure I missed some typos/spelling errors. Just let me know if you see them.  But all in all I'm happy with the way things have changed.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
