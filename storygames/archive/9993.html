It's primarily intended to be something along the lines of a creative attempt at surveying possibilities, and secondarily an attempt to raise awareness for and interest. This 'game' will have 3 phases. The first phase is where you suggest an Endgame Goal. Post an idea, or a vote for someone else's idea. In a short time, I will see which idea has the most promise, and we'll move on to phase 2.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nBy reading this thread, you're standing at the table. On the table is a book with the name "Mage Blade" written in fanciful writing across the front. At each seat around the table, there's a character sheet, a pencil, and a single twenty-sided die.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy posting to this thread, you're taking one of those seats. It's a big table, though. Don't worry about crowding. You can play along or just watch. It's more fun to play, of course...<br/>\n<br/>\n"So," I say to you, "The first thing we have to do is come up with the Endgame Goal. Think about it like watching a movie. You generally know what's going to happen by the end pretty early on, but you watch to see *how* it happens, and what happens to lead up to it. Endgame is like that. For instance, it doesn't take you long to find out that the Deathstar is bad news, so it's got to go. Destroying the Deathstar could totally be an Endgame Goal. Or even defeating the Empire, if you wanted to think longer term. The idea here is a broad-strokes statement of something you'd like to see happen in the fiction. Don't get too detailed or specific." I lean back in my chair, twisting the book around so you can read the name better. "Mage Blade is a fantasy game, pretty traditional in setting. Elves, dwarves, humans, orcs, all of that. Ancient wars, mysterious treasures and plenty of opportunity for adventure." Then I lean forward, take up a pencil with a smile, and look around at everyone gathered around. "So, what ideas do you have for Endgame?"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221840/#Comment_221840" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T13:11:12+00:00" title="July 31, 2009  1:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My end game is conquering the world as an orc lord.

I realize I was a bit less than clear when I stated what Endgame was, though. The Endgame Goal is a group campaign goal, rather than an individual goal. On the other hand, if the group is fine with there being a 'main character' for the campaign, then you can totally rock out with an individualized goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let's list out what we've got, so far:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.   Orcish world domination, with elf punching<br/>\n2.   Controversial marriage of feuding houses<br/>\n3.   Ascension to Godhood, with vengeance (individual)<br/>\n4.   Free the king from his delusions<br/>\n5.   Become the leader of a new civilization (individual?)<br/>\n6.   De-oppress the oppressed Whutevari people<br/>\n7.   Defeat the lich lord and his empire<br/>\n8.   Claim the Forgotten Sea navigational charts<br/>\n9.   Die. Finally. (pretty sure this is individual)<br/>\n10. Claim the Mage Blade. Kill Ben. Or his character. Yanno, whatever. (individual)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that's more than enough to get started with. Let's let this next round of posts be about hashing out which one we're gonna go with. I'm just the humble GM, servant to your collective will, but I'll weigh in with which ones I like best, and why.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 is awesome, because I'd never have come up with it myself. Having a bunch of characters who, one way or the other, end up working toward this goal sounds like it could be very cool. I see lots of politics and some cloak and dagger stuff. The Endgame could be about the wedding ceremony, and the desperate, last ditch efforts to stop it, which the PCs will likely attempt to foil.)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. is also pretty cool, because it requires some additional setup. Which king? What delusions?<br/>\n<br/>\n6 and 7 are bog-standard stuff I'd like to see played with Mage Blade. Grand, sweeping goals that will require exploration, combat, negotiations and travel, almost certainly with a nice big climax.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. is especially cool, because it acknowledges and takes advantage of the closed-form campaign structure.. This campaign has an end-point, but that doesn't mean we have to stop playing! I have to wonder how getting some scrolls will be the focus of an entire campaign, though. That would be interesting to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n10 and 3 are an interesting pair, because they could be mixed. In the setting (which I'm not going to bother with for this little game) the Mage Blade is an incredibly powerful artifact, and the last mortal to hold it is the closest thing to a god the setting had... Only now he's exiled to a prison dimension.<br/>\n<br/>\n5 is also interesting. Obviously you've got to discover a new/lost people along the way. It prescribes some of what has to happen, but not too much. It could be individual, or it could be that the character who becomes the leader isn't determined until the game is actually in play. Quite doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo round 1, part 2: Which ones do you like, or how might we combine some together to make an even cooler Endgame? Remember the idea is broad strokes. Too many details spoil the story!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221891/#Comment_221891" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T00:44:28+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 12:44AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I be the Lich Lord?

Also, the game has fairly traditional assumptions about player character make up: You don't have to be in a party, but it helps if you've got compatible goals. So you could be, assuming the group is cool with it, an immortal lich. You couldn't really be the Endgame Goal, though, unless you were the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\n::ponder:: Of course, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe you could be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn immortal lich, bored and weary of existence initiates a quest that will end in his demise. He prods the heroes into motion, then joins their band under a false guise, aiding them at whim, and covertly throwing challenges in their way. Only at Endgame is his ruse discovered, and he takes on the mantle of his full power.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sort of thing would be an advanced use of the rules, but I think it's possible with minimal tweaking. Is that the sort of thing you're interested in, Ben?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221910/#Comment_221910" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T08:18:03+00:00" title="August  1, 2009  8:18AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2009 8:24AM by Joe_Beason.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe one of the things that sucks about being a lich lord is that he doesn't get more powerful.  He's either stuck where he was when he became a lich (can experience, but never learn), or regularly forgets anything more than a few decades ago.  Sort of like Walker's character in the comic book "Powers", but with more ennui.<br><br>Maybe the entire group that's been cursed with the same condition.  The undying remember just enough of their past to understand their condition, and recognize each other.  The game could include flashbacks (be they played-out scenes, or moments of "helpful" awareness).<br><br>Why are they after the Mageblade?  Because it's the only thing that can end their tiresome existence.  But at least a few of the characters, including the orc, secretly believe that whoever controls it will be able to remember and use his or her entire past, and thereby ascend.  And others may believe it's wrong for any of them to have that kind of power, so whoever would be lich lord/god must be stopped.<br><br>The deluded king could be an undying who has forgotten too much, which has led him into a foolish marriage with a queen who's aging while he doesn't.  And she, the court, and the torch-and-pitchfork peasantry are starting to get very, very nervous about him.  He needs to be removed from his situation for his own good, and also because if they figure out his true nature, the other undying are in danger, too.  (Just because you can't die doesn't mean normal people can't hurt you.  A lot.)<br><br>The charts are part of the kingdom's treasure, and point to the location of the blade.  <br><br>The feuding houses may be part of the kingdom, or may be in some other arc.  Perhaps they're the descendants of two of the undying, and their feud is ironic.  Or may have its roots in a forgotten conflict between the undying.<br><br>The oppressed people could be subjects of the undying king, or could be part of another arc entirely.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221916/#Comment_221916" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T08:53:26+00:00" title="August  1, 2009  8:53AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Endgame:  Foster a revolution into a full blown modern nation state of democracy abolishing orc slavery along the way.

"Next up, we get to make characters. Let's not get too in-depth yet. We're not going to worry about mechanics at this stage. All those stat blocks on your sheet, just ignore 'em. Matter of fact, flip over the sheet to the back." The back of the character sheet is blank. "Lets talk about character concepts. Keep the Endgame Goal in mind, too. Some rough guidelines is that your characters are probably in the 20-25 age bracket, though they can be a bit older, and even as young as 10. Write down some notes. If it takes more than 3-4 sentences to describe your concept, you're over-thinking it." Having given instructions, I look down at the page in front of me, glancing around at the people seated at the table, as if counting, and I take some notes. "Feel free to talk amongst yourselves, give suggestions and such. Let me know when you've finalized your concept."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Oh yeah, one more thing. Once you're done describing your concept, pick an element out of the 4 typical ones of Earth, Water, Air and Fire, or a 5th, Void. Your choice is kind of like a zodiac sign. It should be roughly descriptive of personality type. Don't over-think this either.

Anyone who wants to add a character, feel free to do so, but once you're done, move on into the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n"A nicely mixed bag," I murmur, looking over the concepts. A few with reasons to be interested in the sea, and a few others just looking to get swept along in the next epic adventure." We move on into the mechanical bits of character creation, selecting lifepaths and getting skills and traits to fill out our character abilities. Once we're all done, I look around at you all again. "The final thing before we begin playing is to create Foundational Goals. I like to think of Foundational Goals as being the last step of character creation. These goals aren't intended to have anything to do with your character's ultimate destiny. They're intended to finish rounding out your character. They're intended to get the character in motion. That motion doesn't necessarily have to do with moving toward the Endgame Goal, especially considering that accomplishing these goals doesn't mechanically move the game any closer to Endgame. It's just the impetus that starts the ball rolling." I look over the characters, rubbing my chin thoughtfully. "Some of these concepts already have some good Foundational Goals inferred. LeMarque may want to escape those looking to stopper his ears and seal his lips. Maybe Roggwyn wants to find a companion. Ilona wants to find a patron so she can hire a crew. A good rule of thumb is that your goals should have some chance of bringing the characters into contact. We don't necessarily have to end up with an adventuring party, but an interwoven story is a better story."<br/>\n<br/>\n"You've got 50 points each to purchase Foundational Goals. Each 10 points you put into a Goal indicates roughly one challenge to overcome to accomplish it. The points you put in to each Goal are also what you'll get back to set Goals which will drive the story forward later, and to improve your character's effectiveness later. Oh, also... it's very important to understand that these goals aren't <i>necessarily</i> things your character wants. They're things <b>you</b> want your character to accomplish. You will drive your character to accomplish them, regardless of in-character motivations. Roggwyn doesn't necessarily know he's looking for a companion, but he'll likely manage to get one anyway."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222312/#Comment_222312" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T17:18:41+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  5:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GOAL (20 points) - IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL<br/>\nLeMarque knows his life is shit, but it's HIS life and he covets it dearly.

I've read books with stuff like this, so it's pretty amazing that I've been completely blind-sided with the idea that people might actually set goals like this in Mage Blade. My first reaction (after the 'whoa' wore off) was to think "Man, how the hell would I set up obstacles and opportunities to work toward this?" Then a few things suggested themselves. This would be a lot harder to pull off, but it could definitely work, if the GM and the player are on the same page about things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve,<br/>\n<br/>\nHard how? Hard to come up with goals, hard to determine how to distribute points?

As a player, the important part for me is that the collaboration doesn't remove the surprise of "what happens next". It doesn't matter so much to me if the goal is achieved or not (at least, at this stage) so much as I have a chance to play towards that decisive moment where we all find out.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike, right now, I have a vague notion that LeMarque's past failures have to do with something that happened when he was a friar, and probably played a role in him no longer being a friar. I keep getting this image of him standing by as innocent people are burned alive. Supposed witches maybe? I dunno. But I like to play into the unknown, so I don't need more than that vague beginning to satisfy me. It eventually gets fleshed out during play and that process is a good deal of the fun for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222343/#Comment_222343" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T00:33:02+00:00" title="August  4, 2009 12:33AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2009 12:37AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike: "Um, I dunno, Lance...

That's why it can't be too specific, because then it comes down to being pass/fail, with you knowing exactly how it will turn out either way, even before you begin playing. That's why "destroy the One Ring by throwing it into the Fires of Mount Doom" is a bad Endgame Goal, but "Defeat Sauron" isn't. You don't know if Frodo will actually manage to do away with the Ring, or if Sauron will get it back and resurrect, requiring a great battle like the one with Ysildor (no idea if I spelled that right) back in the age. The direction is important, but the details are what make the story interesting. Also, there's no guarantee of success on any Goal. Sometimes, failure is the more interesting option. What happens if Sauron wins? That's something to be addressed in a follow-on campaign."<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: The Mageblade. That's a perfectly valid point, and a worthy Endgame Goal. I'm not even going to think about prescribing it, though. This isn't the sort of game that is based on a given scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris,<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all goals, it's important that the GM and player see eye to eye on what accomplishing the goal means. This is doubly important for this sort of Goal. The worst case scenario is where I put an opportunity for LeMarque to see that he's worthy of redemption out in front of him, and you either don't recognize it, or aren't interested. Specifically for Foundational Goals, you do need to spell them out up front. They are things you need to address and resolve for your character to be "complete". Think of Foundational Goals as being similar to an extended accomplishment phase from Dogs in the Vineyard. After that, you will continue to set goals as appropriate, using some of the points you gained from accomplishing your Foundational Goals. You never have to set another Goal until you want to do so. So yes, it's allowed to hold points in reserve until a suitable goal presents itself in play, just not for Foundational Goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222352/#Comment_222352" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T04:50:31+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  4:50AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shemial:<br><br>GOAL (40 points): Reject the conspiracy.

I basically assumed that's what you were going for when you mentioned it in the concept. At any point in play, you could point to a fellow player and say "You! Your character can be my character's confidant." If they agreed, then some challenge or complication would need to be overcome before that could happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the ratio of your goals. It's pretty likely (though not necessary) that Shemial will find a confidant before getting away from the conspirators.

The first moreso than the second, though it might largely be your phrasing. What would count as "getting a real life"?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latter is not too bad, but what you're telling me is that before the 'adventure' gets under way, you want to set mom up for life, and you don't want to try too hard to do it. It's important enough to set as a goal, but it's not important enough to assign a lot of points to. If that sounds about right, then we can leave it as is.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour third is nice and simple. Basically, you want to find out who did it, and you want to "do something" to accomplish this goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMan.

keeping things in mind. I lost internet connection for a couple days and had sporadic internet connection for a few more, and as a result this dropped completely off my radar. Luckily, Mike decided to have another go at arguing his point, and brought it back onto my radar.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, it's more than safe to say that everyone is done. The next step would be to actually sit down and play. Over the course of the first few sessions, a majority of these goals would be resolved, and you as players would set others. I would take the goals, and weave them together into situations, and play would continue. Beyond the foundational goals, you'd be setting goals that either advanced the plot toward Endgame (Rising Actions) or detracted/distracted from Endgame (Falling Actions). The mix of these would end up with an organically paced game, where you could slow things down by setting Falling Actions, or speed them up with Rising Actions. These have the mechanical effect of incrementing a number called the EndCount, which when it reaches a certain value will trigger Endgame.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a little dismayed at the beginning of this process, unfairly I believe now. There were some suggestions that seemed intentionally silly or over the top, and I had to pull back and realize that 1. silliness is going to happen at the table too, 2. these suggestions may have been attempts to test how far the game/process can go and 3. they may have been legitimate suggestions. Some of them, as we've seen, were less than ideal for the system. Others may simply seem that way to me because I'm a prissy bitch, but with this system and your individual groups may be perfectly viable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy intentions with this thread were varied.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I wanted to see what sorts of Endgames, characters and goals would appear. I've been surprised before by the creativity of the indie, small-press and story-games communities, so I wanted to have an idea what sorts of things might come up, and make sure the game can handle most of them. I didn't want to drown you all with system and setting, so what we got was a bit more free-wheeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I wanted to see what comments arose about the general system. Steve and Mike were the only ones thus far to really make comments about the process, though most of Mike's have been in whispers with me. I'm figuring that the general lack of commentary is due to either people not wanting to derail the "process", or because they didn't see anything worth commenting about. For those who may have had comments but refrained, now would definitely be the time to speak up. Steve was "curious (in a good way)" and Mike has been vehement in his opinion that this is a bad way to try to meet my goals. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said before, this process and these characters are awesome, to me. I'd be excited to get started with the game that we've theoretically begun. That brings us to the third thing I was hoping for from this thread: I want an idea of how well this process sets up compelling characters and situations, and how well it encourages player investment. That's where I'd like a little bit more from everyone who followed along. Did you find this process enjoyable, and interesting? Did it create characters and initial situations that you find compelling? Could you see yourself going through this process (including the actual character creation, natch) with your group at home, and coming out with a campaign you'd be jazzed to play in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225239/#Comment_225239" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T16:35:13+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  4:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've refrained from any comment because I'm not particularly clear on your goals with the game nor am I familiar with the overall structure and system of the game. I figured I'd follow your instructions and provide whatever data points I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly it felt like a brainstorming session, then at the end we applied point values to the goals we came up with for our characters. I don't think there was anything particular about how you had us go through the process that regulated the output in any meaningful way. We knew we were working with a general fantasy setting. You asked us to create a sort of overall campaign goal. Then we created a basic character concept. Then we gave those characters goals (with point values) in relation to that concept and the chosen Endgame. Pretty simple, so I'm not sure what kind of feedback you're looking for without knowing more about what specifically you're trying to achieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that without more specific guidance there will probably be a very wide range of results from this creation process. Whether you want that guidance to come specifically from the built in structure of the process or from group discussion and negotiation, or both, is something to think about. If you want a lot of the fine tuning to be through group consensus/negotiation don't forget to put that front and center in the text. Giving this initial process a tight focus wouldn't hurt in my opinion, particularly since I don't perceive that in its existing form that it added much of anything to the creative end product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225295/#Comment_225295" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T23:51:08+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 11:51PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is more guidance in the actual system and game text in terms of what's feasible in the setting and what sorts of characters are allowable. This was intended to be more abstract, so the "very wide range of results" that we saw here was an accepted result. Another goal of this experiment was to get an idea for how much guidance might be necessary in the text, and how much guidance might reasonably be expected to be provided by group discussion and negotiation.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of my intent with this was to keep a relatively low barrier to entry. I didn't want to write an essay on the setting and expected character range so that people would see a wall of words, and opt out of participating. The other part, as I said above, was to see how much guidance might be necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9993/lets-play-a-game" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9993/lets-play-a-game" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9993/lets-play-a-game/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F9993%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F9993%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
