Still, I want to post this up here because I'm fucking afraid of my game.  Let me explain why.<br/><br/>So I've been running a game for the past couple of weeks using the Fate engine.  The game is actually a CthulhuTech campaign that I'd been running for about two months.  Cthulhutech, for those not in the know, is the anime series Macross mixed with Cthulhu mythos.  Giant robots fighting Nyarlathotep.  Me and my group loved the setting ideas but had encountered many, many frustrations with the original system.   So out went the old, clunky system and in went sleek and powerful Fate/SotC.  <br/><br/>Now me being the system mechanic that I am, I love Fate.  At the same time, I know that it has minutiae.  It has beautiful, tiny little gears inside of its engine.  Gears that take a little bit of time to explain.  My Tuesday night group, who I've been playing this game with, they don't have much experience with Fate.  I decided to let them into the pool slowly.  Each session I would introduce another part of the game to them, keep them from feeling overwhelmed.  This week, it was all about Compels.  <br/><br/>I had looked over the PCs Aspects a couple of days ago and saw that there were a couple of them that were perfectly geared for interesting compels.  The kinds where PCs wind up squaring off against each other.  Zoe's character, an alien born on Earth has the Aspect "Mistrust of Humans".  Nora's character, also an alien born on Earth, has the aspect "Patriot" to the Earth government.  Scott, a loyal soldier to the end, has the Aspect "Duty".  <br/><br/>These are good.  These I can work with.  <br/><br/>I come up with a decision point.  A bang.   The characters will be sent to liberate a small mission that is populated by the same type of aliens that Zoe and Nora's characters are.  Some of those missionaries will be sleeper agents, possessed by dark magicks, working for the Cthulian hordes.  This secret, of course, will be revealed.  It is at this time that an NPC, a human politician who has oversight of the base that the PCs work for, will issue an order that all of the civilians at the mission be exterminated for fear of contamination.  <br/><br/>The moment comes.  The order goes through.  I plunk a Fate chip down on the table in front of each of the three players.  <br/><br/>I say, "Nora, you're a patriot."  Bam.  <br/><br/>"Scott, you have a duty to your army."  Bam.  <br/><br/>"Zoe, the man that just gave the order... he's human."  Bam.  <br/><br/>I tell them that they can take that Fate chip if the want, but they'll have to act on their Compels.  Otherwise, they can pay me a Fate chip and act as they will.  <br/><br/>All three of them pick up the Fate chip and sit it right on top of their stacks.  <br/><br/>I smile.  It's on.  <br/><br/>The session lit up from there.  The Players felt the stakes.  Two of them were marching toward what could very well be innocent civilians, following orders that are unimaginable and awful.  Two of them stand apposed to their squad-mates, their friends, their comrades in arms, protecting people that very well could be "the enemy".  <br/><br/>And they fought.  Rockets were fired, hyperblades were drawn, punches were thrown.  <br/><br/>The night ended in the middle of the fight.  There were no clear winners.  And at the end we all just sat there for a minute, no one knowing what the hell was going to happen next, least of all me.  <br/><br/>And I'm still sitting here now, thinking about the session.  How we just got to a point where you simply cannot turn back.  Trust has been broken, bridges lay burnt.  I have no clue what I'm going to do next session, and I'm scared to my bones.  But it's a good scared.  I'm standing at the precipice right here and, god damn, am I enjoying the view.<br/><br/>Now let's get the ball rolling.  What gaming experiences have scared you?  I'd love to hear some examples of play here as well.  And I would love you even more if you were to describe the outcome of those moments that scared you.  Hell, I would love you so much I would cook you dinner and even cuddle with you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161048/#Comment_161048" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T15:12:02+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  3:12PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an early playtest of <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, Shawn was playing an athlete, and I was playing a book-smart kid.  Which is all fine and good ... except that the social context becomes defined by what we think of each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think he's a bully, and he thinks I'm a helpless nerd.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, because the system was not yet even vaguely tuned, we found that the ONLY way that we could conceivably avoid mind-numbingly bad mechanical consequences (like "You're dead now" level bad) was to play to those stereotypes at every opportunity.  So I <b>had to</b> play a hopeless loser so long as Shawn didn't give me any nicer opinion to work off of.  And he <b>had to</b> play a brutal sociopath, so long as I didn't give him anything nicer to work off of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, if I gave him a nicer opinion then he wouldn't <i>need me</i> any more.  And if he gave me a nicer opinion then I wouldn't need him.  And we needed to be needed, because that was our only leverage to get the nicer opinions that we wanted.  It was a bizarre and brutal hostage-trade, where neither of us wanted to be the first one to give up our only leverage, but neither of us wanted to live in the horrible impasse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe eventually stopped in sheer exhaustion, and took notes for future revisions.  Not going to forget that session any time soon, though.  Yikes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_161069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161069/#Comment_161069" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T17:32:07+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  5:32PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2008 6:01PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For years I argued that combat in RPGs are done in an unrealistic and dumb way (at the best it is "cinematic"). Finally I decided to make a module on war for my fantasy RPG <b>Fabula</b>. That was some years back, in 2003, I believe. I came up with a wartime-module: "Ormens Tideverv" (The Age of Snakes). My aim was to make a kind of war-focus for Fabula, with effective tools that would force the players to immerse in something like the experiences of the soldiers in the field.<br><br>I succeeded. My worst/best gamesession with it was at a convention in Oslo, with adult players (of course). After the session I felt filthy, filthy for being brutally empathic to each of the player/character-entities, drowning them in the harsh reality of a war like the ones in Yugoslavia and Rwanda (in a sword and bow-setting). Civilians were butchered, and principles broken, and it all took place in a methodically induced maelstrom of violence and social sadness over which the players/characters had no control, but which still left them with the responsibility. The foul acts of war was committed by them, under military order, and landed on their shoulders with devastating force when they returned home as "heroes" (how do "the homecoming hero" explain his murder of a pregnant woman to his smiling mother and excited little-sister? How does the "hero" celebrate such a victory?).<br><br>My players felt filthy too after this session, and shocked, and hurt, and on some level: grateful to me for dragging them through the experience. Yes; they did thank me afterwards, telling me this had opened their eyes to how powerful a RPG could really be, and how a soldier in the field can be faced with life-and-death situations where no normal ethics are sufficient to protect him.<br><br>Some of the players left the convention after the game, not caring to play any more games that evening, after playing my war-scenario. One of them went on to what he described as "a Cthulhu-session with a great GM and a strong scenario", but still felt it "like a matchstick compared to an inferno" (his words). He just could not get into the Cthulhu-fright that night. It paled in comparison to the horrors he had been through, and still carried with him (he told me the next day, and said that the players going home probably had made the better choice).<br><br>I was frightened and jubilant after the experience. Jubilant because I realized that RPGs are very powerful tools for exploring human conditions, and with this scenario I had achieved a new level in my game-design. Frightened because such tools in the hands of the wrong people are dangerous, and I really put my players to a great test by exposing them to the drama of this game. I am glad all of them came out of it with a positive experience, although it was horrifying.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
