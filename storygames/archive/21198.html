Potentially compromises the verisimilitude of the story.<br/>2. Potential introduces anincoherent idea into the story internally inconsistent or illogical.<br/>3. Potentially excessively violates the tone that the group agreed the story would have during the set up stage of the game, without the groups consent.<br/>4. (I'm not sure I should include this one; I'm debating its usefulness and whether it can even be applied correctly or in a meaningful way. With that said, here it is): <br/>Potentially makes the story threads difficult to weave back together into a coherent and satisfying ending.<br/><br/>The phrase I have been thinking of using when these issues arise is: "Should we go in another direction?" or "Let's discuss that," or "Let's have a discussion," or "Can we have a discussion?" or "Can we discuss that?" or simply using the ritual phrase, "Discussion." Do you think one of these phrases works best and is most polite and least likely to cause defensiveness or upset the player narrating the scene? Or do you have a suggestion for phrase you think that would work better? <br/><br/>I wan't to emphasize that while a phrase is used when a potential issue comes up, it doesn't mean that the issue is automatically decided by the player raising it. It means the group will have a conversation about the potential issue and decide whether it has merit and compromise to find the best solution moving forward. <br/><br/>It is also important to stress that you wouldn't use this phrase to address creative differences or something you just disliked in the story. Raising a potential objection would have to strictly fit the criteria, and after a group discussion, be found to actually be problematic to the story. <br/><br/>I know that some of you don't think interceding this way in a story game is the role of other players. However, we all must design own games and address problems we see in the GMless games we play as we see best. While individuals creative freedom is the most fundamental part of a story game, the story as a whole, and the satisfaction of other players regarding the story as a whole, is an important issue. The story as a whole effects all the players, and their creative contributions, and if one incoherent idea sends the story off the rails for some of the players, I think it is worth discussing, coming to a consensus and going in a different direction. This is a recurring issue in these type of games and it needs to be addressed. Anyway, I've said enough about that.<br/><br/>Any responses would be super appreciated!

I call it universal because it's designed to be able to make stories in any genre, tone, setting and with any themes. As well as, create stories where the PCs are more or less aiming for similar goals or stories where PCs are very adversarial to one other, or something in between. However, it wouldn't be good at creating a story where there was zero or very little dramatic conflict between PCs. It's made for one shots, so it wouldn't be great at creating campaigns. <b>Story</b> is made to make any type of story that's complete in one session. Think of it as being able to produce the different types of stories found in films. Hope that makes sense.

And when I raise the issue in games I do typically frame it as something that undermines the plausibility of the fiction for me, because that is usually the main issue, with the other issues stemming from it. I know that it can be addressed by getting people on the same page regarding the story that they are going to tell\u2014Fiasco does a great job of this\u2014but this is very hard to do in a story game that is universal and aims to be able to tell stories of any type of genre, tone, setting, with any type of themes.  I'm creating rules and procedures to deal with this, but I feel it has to be something that's made explicit.

It's hard to say for sure.<br/><br/>I'm just taking a guess because over the last few years I've started to ask clarifying questions, more and more often, when something doesn't seem to make sense or "fit".<br/><br/>So far, almost every time the player has revealed, in their answer, some logic which made total sense but just hadn't been communicated properly. Once that's understood, we can get back to play with a renewed sense of coherence around the fiction.<br/><br/>However, it's an optimistic estimate on my part!<br/><br/>I agree that most GMless games suffer from tone/genre coherence, and that often ruins the sessions. One very valid reason to prefer GMed games, I think, is the ability to maintain that kind of coherence (much easier for one person to do so than a democratic group).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464428/#Comment_464428" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T05:15:10+00:00" title="June 29, 2017  5:15AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2017 5:17AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <br/>A conversation does clear things up most of the time, although sometimes an adjustment or compromise is necessary. The problem is when people don't want to have a conversation, because they don't feel comfortable doing so, in a situation in which an incoherent idea effects the play session for most players. It's a difficult balancing act. The last thing you want to do is hurt someone's feelings and it isn't a black and white issue. Its probably not ideal to tackle the issue with ritual phrases,  if you can solve it with the mechanics and other procedures that would be best. But, it's a difficult problem to successfully address in universal GMless Story Game. I personally do like GMless, one-shot games the best. I love the distribution of authority and the creativeness of the stories,  and the surprises that come from building on one another's ideas. The reason I talk about their issues is because I love them and I want to solve the issues.

This can even be a good idea in certain rare-ish circumstances.<br/><br/>The "best" way in my experience is to stop and explain why this or that isn't working for you, and why it needs to change. It's better because it improves the long-term skill and cooperative habit of everybody included, instead of trying to paper over the cracks with a quick fix. At first players may find it emotionally difficult to be put on the spot by either challenging or defending creative contributions, but it's better to undergo this mild amount of stress now and get used to it, rather than try to avoid the fact that sometimes players need to veto each other.<br/><br/>Also, I agree with Paul about the nature of most creative difficulties: nine times out of ten it proves unnecessary to challenge a stupid contribution, as it proves out that it's not so much that the contribution is stupid, but rather that it was explained poorly. For this reason my single most favourite way to "veto" is by asking clarifying questions and restating the contribution in my own words:<br/><br/><i>"Do I understand correctly that your character had been lurking there for the entire morning, so as to jump out right now?"</i><br/><br/><i>"So you're saying that the prince can't marry because your character is also in love with him, but they can't quite say it out loud, right?"</i><br/><br/><i>Are you sure that you're choosing a wise direction here - perhaps we shouldn't go there, considering that we have children at the table?</i><br/><br/>Asking clarifying questions about player contributions will most of the time either explain the contribution to you in a way that makes you accept it, or the other player, when trying to answer your questions, will realize that there's a problem, and amend their own contribution. Either way, the Socratic method has saved you from having to directly challenge something that did not, after all, require a direct challenge. You can always start actually complaining when you're certain that there is a problem, and the other player is doubling down on the error, so that there's a genuine disagreement in existence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464434/#Comment_464434" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T08:31:25+00:00" title="June 29, 2017  8:31AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you have any other ritual phrases in <i>Story</i>?

That goes against the tone we set" or "OK, break. That's contradictory". Just be blunt about it, treat it as if the other person made a rules mistake. Use it on your own contributions as well.

Can we talk about that?" or Paul's  "Let's take a time out" the best. The idea is for it to begin a conversation and to clarify what is happening in the story. (Because most of the time the issue is a communication issue and nothing really is incoherent). If after the clarification someone still thinks there is an issue then there would be a conversation about that, and whether others agreed. And then everyone would find a way forward together. I agree, I don't know how you don't make it awkward or hurt anyone's feelings. I'm hoping I can make it the culture of the game so that it is just part of the whole game whole cloth and doesn't cause defensiveness. <b>Archipelago</b> tries to do this\u2014and I don't know how effective it is, because I've only played it once\u2014but that's the vibe I'm aiming at.<br/><br/>My game isn't going to be CC. Rules and procedures can't be copyrighted anyway, so to me the only difference between a CC and a non-CC game, is whether you want to give away your game for free. The most important thing to me is that we can build upon one another's ideas. For example, without Fiasco, Follow and Q&amp;P: Schism [an unpublished story game] their would be no <b>Story</b>, because those games inspired a lot of what <b>Story</b> is. <br/><br/>As far as posting one sided threads, I probably worry about it less then I should. If I want custom dice, I figure someone else might want custom dice. If I'm concerned about tying up story threads in GMless games, I figure someone else is concerned about it as well. People on the story games threads have been extremely generous to me and really helped me in a lot of ways. I agree that it's important to make sure you are giving as well as taking.

Pathfinder didn't use the direct text from WotC's SDR, they used the IP that WotC opened up to other publishes via the SDR.<br/><br/>As far as implying that their is no benifit to an open license, I wrote:<br/><i>Rules and procedures can't be copyrighted anyway, so <b>to me the only difference</b> between a CC and a non-CC game, is whether you want to give away your game for free</i><br/>I wasn't talking about an SDR, I was talking about a game published under Creative Commons and under Creative Commons you share your game and dictate the terms of how it can be shared. I was not saying that there were no benifits to an open license. I was saying what the major difference was, in my opinion, with regards to publishing my indie story game. We already all share our games and build upon one another's games and credit each other when we do so. I don't have any IP in my game because it's a universal story game, I don't have specific places or characters or monsters or any of those things that would be considered IP. And I've seen one game, Monster Hearts, that directly quoted another game throughout the text. So for me, the major difference is whether I want to give away my game for free or not.<br/><br/>I'm not sure the conversation we're having is productive, it feels adversarial for the sake of adversarialness, and doesn't seem like it's been instructive or insightful to either of us.

This is what we do when it comes up in the games we play. How do you think you would systemize this and put it into a game? Would you just give a bit of advice? My idea was to have a ritual phrase that would indicate it's was time to have a conversation, and then at that point the restatement, clearifing questions, etc. would come up? How would you handle systemizing it? Thanks <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </p></div></blockquote>\nIt depends on the game, but I personally would probably not put this stuff in any more central role than just a piece of advice in most games. This is because - again, for most games - I don't feel like this is a major element: most of the time you do not, as a rule, bicker with other players about veto-worthy things. The games where you do (perhaps because they're actively adversial on a storytelling level) are a different and specialized breed.<br/><br/>Ritual phrases and other similar high-maintenance rules mechanics are an inappropriate tool for marginal concerns. For marginal special case situations you want to use a mechanical solution that does not require players to have freshly memorized and practiced maneuvers. The classical solution of "have a good GM who recognizes a creative difficulty and knows how to address one" is an example of a solution that passes this test: it's not incredible for a GM to cultivate this skill, and it's credible that they would be able to act successfully to address this problem.<br/><br/>Of course, a game with no GM doesn't have that authority position to help in chairmanning the creative discussion, plus the players are much more often in creative interaction with each other in a game where everybody plays "towards" everybody else, rather than everybody playing towards the GM. (Hub model vs. web model of interaction there.) This means that the traditional solution becomes "you don't have a GM, but hopefully you individually as a player know how to resolve creative differences - or surely you have at least one player in there who can act as a referee between you two idiots?"<br/><br/>But then, surely the game designer can do something about this - merely giving advice like "be an experienced gamer with highly developed skills, or lacking that, at least read a bunch of advice I wrote to simulate it" is a little bit weak-sauce, admittedly.<br/><br/>Thinking about this, a ritual phrase could be part of an appropriate solution. I recommend having <i>one</i> ritual phrase for "meta-game control" purposes, though - I do not think that it is realistic game design to have multiple phrases for various types of meta-level concern, at that point you're just loading mind-space for no good reason. (Unless it's the point of the game to learn a lot of special beautiful activity, of course - like tea ceremony, for instance.) So you don't want to have a "I gotta go to the bathroom" metagame ritual phrase and a "I gotta talk about your use of rape as a narrative theme" metagame ritual phrase separately. It's enough for the players to remember one simple thing, which might be phrased strongly in this way:<br/><br/><i>It's OK to want to stop and talk about what we're doing, because understanding each other is important. When I want to stop, reconsider and talk in awareness about what we're trying to accomplish here, I go [X].</i><br/><br/>One phrase could have merit in this regard, simply because it might help the players shape out an attitude of open consideration and criticism. Then again, it might also cause such communication to be categorized away, made into something <i>inappropriate</i> for the game - this is my personal basic concern with techniques like the X card and ritual phrases that limit player communication, because using those seems to strongly imply that you're not allowed to "disrupt play" by talking about those things <i>without</i> activating that special game mechanic. In that regard it's better to not hide the basic attitude of clear communication behind a ritual phrasing.<br/><br/>If one underwrites the idea that good communication is an <i>ubiquitous attitude</i> rather than a <i>special maneuver</i>, then perhaps one has to rule against a ritual phrase that activates a special "critical mode" where the players are allowed to air grievances.<br/><br/>But then, what should one use, rules-wise? I don't have an off-the-shelf solution for a GMless game - for GMed games we know that a clearly written training manual that takes powerful stances suffices to train a GM who can perform in the appropriate way. But what can you do for a GMless game, aside from training whoever happens to read the game text to act as a quasi-GM?<br/><br/>Perhaps a "credo", a text that is read at the beginning of play? I could see that working as a tool of openly establishing creative routines. Make it punchy and tell the players to read it at the beginning of every session, and I could see it do more good than the introduction of a ritual phrase that fences off and spotlights a particular type of behavior. Tell the group that they should revise the credo if they find any faults in it, and it's not even annoyingly authoritarian as an idea.<br/><br/>Alternatively or in addition, how about a reverse ritual phrase? A "reverse ritual phrase" is a ritual phrase that you use to respond to an initiative, instead of making one. So in this case, instead of having the player who has a problem memorize a ritual phrase that legitimizes their complaint (as if they didn't have a legitimate right to complain otherwise), how about instead having the complaint-receiver have a mandated response? Something like "Thank you for bringing this up, I appreciate your courage in talking about it, and it is good to the game and appropriate play content for us to spend a moment talking about it."<br/><br/>Reversing the ritual phrase requirement has a couple of advantages to my eye:<br/><b>*</b> It's policeable: the other players can remind the target of the critique about how they should respond before continuing on.<br/><b>*</b> It's didactic: the ritual phrase itself reminds the player about the appropriate attitude, instead of merely being a formalized polite phrase.<br/><b>*</b> It puts pressure where it belongs: instead of requiring the player with a possibly difficult social initiative to remember and perform the appropriate ritual to avoid backlash, it forces the player who might otherwise answer harshly (or otherwise in a bad way) to reply with a formula of acknowledgement.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" rel="nofollow">Wilhelm</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Stolen from Archipelago.

That might even get them to learn them.<br/><br/>If I were re-writing <i>Polaris</i> right now, I would give it a starting ritual where the players practice the ritual phrases a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464474/#Comment_464474" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T22:27:10+00:00" title="June 29, 2017 10:27PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_B_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <br/>As a quick aside Eero, do you think you could either provide a link (maybe others are interested as well) or message me the URL to the English games section of your website.

I'll readily send you the most current version if you message me your e-mail address.<br/>Which brings us to the topic of how terrible I am at distributing. I definitely ought to put both <i>Awkward</i> and the expanded edition of <i>Enter the Avenger</i> (which has been like 99% ready for over a year, only missing some more work on front and back cover layout) up for sale on websites such as Drivethru etc. I should, at the very least, put up the most current version of Awkward (which fixes, like, 1 typo in a footnote) somewhere for people to download!<br/>That's saying nothing about stuff I still have to finish writing, as well. I'm now 50% through writing my tribute game to <i>Everway</i> I've been bragging about so loudly on this forum* and soon I'll have to look into ways to, well, distribute it. There also these two other games that I've designed and played enough times I'm almost bored with them, which I'm calling <i>Bloodhound Blues</i> and <i>The Truth Dies With Them</i>, and I know I must write them down. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.<br/><small>I constantly complain about not having enough free time, or not being good enough at time management, to focus on these things as I wish I could... It was a shock when I recently realized a fellow game designer's per-game Patreon revenue was actually higher than the average monthly salary I earned working my last "real" job. I'm currently hoping for a state unemployment check - I could maybe live off that for a few months while focusing on building an audience for my games and distributing them... but that's a tough bet, compared to actively looking for employment.</small><br/><br/>* Incidentally, that's been faster to write thanks to Matthijs allowing me to reuse text verbatim from <i>Archipelago</i>. That ties into the other aside you had in this thread. I'm not sure whether you understand that for a game text licensed CC-BY or CC-BY-SA (as is the case of both EtA and Awkward) all of a text effectively doubles as the "SRD": you can reuse any part of those without even having to ask.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464479/#Comment_464479" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T23:30:03+00:00" title="June 29, 2017 11:30PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2017 11:30PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> <br/>Awesome, I'm excited to hear that you've gotten some games done and some upcoming.

That mirrors my own misgivings about the matter - I'm not certain that safety rules are within the proper magisterium of game design when the practical executioner of the game should have final responsibility. Design can suggest procedures that players may use to better achieve given goals, but it cannot make decisions about the context in which the game is played, or enforce actions proper to the local play culture.<br/><br/>The worst game safety transgressions I've ever seen have always featured the idea that game rules = proper things for the players to do, with no separation between the rules of the venue and the rules of the game. That's how you get people jumping off roofs because the GM told them to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464493/#Comment_464493" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-30T07:56:21+00:00" title="June 30, 2017  7:56AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But this should exist alongside <i>safety rules</i>, and entirely separate.<br/>Safety, including any player's ability to "veto" content (that they find uncomfortable or triggering) with no questions asked, should always take precedence.

I wonder what type of language would be best to couch this in. If you had similar aims as me and you were making a universal GMless story game, with equal authority, scene framing, etc, how do you think you would do it Paul? Any ideas, the idea of using a  conceit is new to me.  The film metaphor makes a lot of sense, but there wouldn't be a director, and you would want anyone to be able to use the language. I'm not sure how to do it but it's a very good idea <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464513/#Comment_464513" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-01T01:14:27+00:00" title="July  1, 2017  1:14AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <br/>Thanks for all of your thoughts Eero. I was thinking about one simple phrase to denote it's time to have a discussion, nothing too formal, something like: "Let's discuss that," or "time out," or "Wait. Can we talk about that."  It wouldn't necessarily have to be a ritual phrase, there would just be a rule that encouraged having a conversation if one of these issues came up. I very much like the idea of having the facilitator read a "credo" at the beginning of the game. The credo could say stuff like this is part of the game so let's try to do this in the spirit of goodwill and not take offense when we address things like this with one another.  David, offered a way to respond to a player who introduced an incoherent element to the story; the response he suggested was: "I can't retain my sense of a fictional coherence if that happens."  I think in the credo this could be emphasized. It's not about one player making a mistake, it's about us making a story we can all buy into and all enjoy together, so if we have a conversation about something it's no big deal, it's just a way to ensure that we're creating a story that all of us can buy into, and making a little adjustment to the story so that this can happen is something we should welcome.  <br/>A reverse ritual phrase is a very novel idea, I'll have to give it more thought and see if it strikes me as the way to go. If I was going to incorporate a ritual phrase it would just be one. Thank you so much for your generous response and thoughts.

You're back to ritual phrases and that kind of thing.<br/><br/>However, I don't think it would be impossible to introduce a conceit without limiting the genre and tone of the game.<br/><br/>These aren't great examples; just off the top of my head:<br/><br/><b>Imaginary Audience</b><br/><br/>When you play the game, you create a story for a group of fans/audience. Maybe they're populations - "the fans", "the critics", that kind of thing - or maybe they're specific individuals - Lucy, Dan, Rafael, Mika. Maybe they're Greek muses or Gods. <br/><br/>When you set up the game, you define what they care about together. "The critics are really concerned with consistency of tone." "Rafael loves stories that are funny, and can't deal with serious material." "The fans are obsessed with plot continuity, and they demand that everything be realistic." "Aphrodite won't be appeased unless someone falls in love." "The panel will never approve our script unless it has gender parity."<br/><br/>Or whatever criteria you want for that particular game and that particular story.<br/><br/>It makes it easier for people to say to each other, "Hey, that's a cool idea, but the critics/Aphrodite/the panel aren't going to like it. Can we fix that?"<br/><br/>"This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, right? If it stays this grim, it will be reclassified by the censors as an R-rated horror film. Can we turn that around in the next scene?"<br/><br/><b>Mechanical Contingencies</b><br/><br/>If you have any kind of resources or tokens or pools, you can assign them to negotiated "pillars" for your particular story. Maybe "Dark and desperate" is one pillar, and "moral ambiguity" is another. If there are mechanics in your game which could be associated with these (even very loosely, or even if the mechanics aren't terribly important), that forces people to think about these "pillars" on a regular basis.<br/><br/>(If it's really a generic game, you'd set these up as a group when you start playing.)<br/><br/>Terrible example:<br/><br/>At the end of each scene, the group collects one token for each pillar which was supported/respected in that scene. <br/><br/>As a group you spend the tokens for stuff like:<br/><br/>* Reveal the secret behind an important mystery<br/>* Trigger the endgame<br/>* Assign players roles for the epilogue<br/><br/>Or whatever other stupid thing which you look forward to completing. If it was Fiasco, you'd trigger the Tilt at 20 tokens and then the Aftermath at 40 tokens; that kind of thing.<br/><br/>This forces everyone to be thinking about these "pillars" all the time, or at least most of the time, and makes them feel like they're working together to support them.<br/><br/>Again, these are horrible ideas, because I haven't thought them through, but maybe they will inspire you with something better!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464518/#Comment_464518" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-01T02:42:11+00:00" title="July  1, 2017  2:42AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, i was just thinking of dropping back in here to talk about establishing an imaginary audience, but Paul beat me to it.<br/><br/>Obviously a specificly characterized audience is off the table for a generic game, but i think its totally possible to have a structure or procedure for establishing the character of the audience. A sort of pick-list of "what do they value/what do they want the story to be." This backs the issue much deeper into the design, though.<br/><br/>Like the idea of establishing "pillars," also, even without the token economy.

I think it may be best to just do everything I can with <b>Story's</b>  set up procedures to "funnel" players into a place where they have at least  tacitly agreed to tell the same type of story. That is, they have agreed on genre, tone, setting, themes, and anything they  definitely want, or definitely don't want, to see in the game. Then have a mechanic for starting a conversation, "time out" or something similar. Perhaps, have  some advice about potential pitfalls of GMless games, and what to look out for. And maybe add the credo idea at the beginning, to make sure that everyone's approaching a conversation with good faith and goodwill. <br/>The problem you're talking about is very real and if somebody is  entering a new group it's always a learning process. You have to get a feel for the new group. If you're a new person and all these veteran player start hitting you with, what you perceive to be, a "wait, you did something wrong" conversation, your probably not going to want go back. And this process is something that happens every time there's a group organized, or a new person enters a group, so it's very important that when I'm deciding what approach to take, I take this into consideration. I'm definitely going to try to err on the side on the side of caution.  It's just about finding the balance.

After a conversation on Story Games, I went back with a prepared "speech" and "warm up exercise" where we were supposed to ease into the process, get used to policing each other with kindness, and maintain tone.<br/><br/>I delivered the speech, everyone seemed on board with it, and excited to play. We went through the warmup exercise, and I was amazed:<br/><br/>Total success! People were effortlessly and consistently keeping tone and mood throughout the exercise. It was like I had instantly converted them! Everyone was totally on board, and grasped the concept right away. It felt almost magical. Wow! Finally, I had cracked the code. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Then we started playing the game proper... and by the second scene we were back to people goofing around and the game was no better than before. Total letdown.<br/><br/>It felt just as though we hadn't done any of that at all - the game felt just the same as it had every other time.<br/><br/>It was a strange and confusing experience, and even after several conversations about it with some of the players afterwards, no more clear to any of us. <br/><br/>For years afterwards, I decided that perhaps that was some side effect of my design - clearly, my game didn't do enough to put people on the same page. So I gave up on that aspect of the experience.<br/><br/>As you know, Jeff, a couple of months ago I played Musette again with some other non-gamers. This time I didn't do any discussion or warmup or ritual phrases or any such thing: I just said, "Here's this game. Let's try it!"<br/><br/>However, these people grabbed onto it and the energy was palpable from the very first five minutes. Staying "in the same creative space" was effortless and the story told was incredible - one of my favourite gaming experiences to date. We all blew each other away, and afterwards people attributed it to my "skills as a facilitator" - they said I told them exactly what to do and how, and it was immediately obvious to them. However, I'm not aware of anything I did differently from previous games; if anything, I had given up and ceased to worry about it.<br/><br/>Mysterious, indeed.<br/><br/>Part of me wants to play the same game again with that same group, to see if the alchemy will happen once more. Another part is afraid to, because it would be such a letdown if it doesn't.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

(Sparked and herded, yes, but not really captured or molded.) Something akin to psychoanalysis in scope, nuance and long-term effort would be more likely to transform the creative chemistry between a given pair of people.<br/><br/>In other words: you're just having variety happen because you're playing with different people.

Fiasco handles this through setting up expectations and having great rules, but it really helps that everyone knows what type of story's being told. I'm not sure how to do this with a universal Story Game other than having folks agree on genre, setting, tone, themes, and having players say the things that they definitely want in the game, and the things they definitely don't want in the game (something like the Palette technique in <b>Microscope</b>), during setup. In <b>Story</b> players do also create an introduction to their story that helps to frame it. It's similar to a Logline (<a href="http://www.filmdaily.tv/logline/top-box-office-logline-examples" rel="nofollow">examples</a>) in a movie, but a little more detailed. Here's an example of a story introduction that the players might create: <br/>"The royal houses have come together for a jousting competition and to celebrate the new year. However, during the celebrations the king has fallen ill. There are rumors in the air and great suspicion among the nobles and commoners alike. The houses suspect one another of foul play. Was the king poisoned? Was blood magic involved? Who stands to gain from the king's demise? Whispers of succession spread among the elites as the covetous and cunning scheme and position themselves behind the scenes with dark dealings. Will the king regain his health and retain the thrown? Can he be protected? Will one, among the many who claim to be the rightful heir,  take his seat? Or will the throne fall into even darker hands?  The crown and the future of the kingdom lie in the balance."<br/>I kind of got a little more detailed than I should have, and the story introduction typically wouldn't be this long or detailed, but you get the idea. So basically, I'm trying to get everyone on the same page and envisioning the same story by having them choose their genre, setting, tone, themes, do something similar to a Palette, and write an intro (logline). There's also the creation of questions and obstacles at the beginning and throughout the game, which also help to further "funnel" the story. (We talked about these question seeds and obstacles seeds on Google Hangouts, after a game, but I'm not sure if you remember them in any detail or if I was able to explain them well).<br/><br/>Anyway Paul, if you or anyone else have any ideas about how one my be able to get players  roughly on the same page using game mechanics or rules, I'd love to hear about it. I know it's no easy task, but it might be a pretty interesting discussion.

And when players play, if they don't choose a scinerio, they have to build one. I think I will create more scinerios for the game and encourage new players to play some first before  attempting to build their own. I do think that having predefined scinerios helps a lot. I also think the mechanic that <b>Tales of Entropy</b> uses to have players choose a scinerio is a good one.

I really think that having a rehearsal sounds like a very promising way to get everyone on the same page regarding tone\u2014I haven't tried it myself  in any meaningful way yet, but this is my intuition and based on what you, David, and what others have said. I don't think I want to sacrifice the other elements of set up or sacrifice getting the game done in under four hours, so I'm kind of at an impasse. I might be able to troubleshoot it though. Ultimately, need to do a lot of playtesting with different groups and see what works in general for most groups; and most importantly, is able to retain the most individual creativity and not make anyone uncomfortable or upset. One of the advantages of playing a quick play scenario is that it would likely leave time to have a rehearsal.  One thing that I think we're all getting out of this thread, it's a discussion about an important topic, that sometimes can present a difficult during play, and I'm happy for that. As an  aside, I found that playing with longtime friends, friends with which you can be absolutely honest and he won't take offense, really helps everyone get on the same page; being that, you could have a very open discussion about the subject. Thanks so much for your great and instructive ideas, David.  I very much value your insights and are grateful for them. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>P.S.

You playtest their game and the playtest yours. I think with SG SLC, Paul an company, and others that I swap play testing with, I'll be good. I'll probably do an open playtest to, for anyone who happens to be interested. Although, I plan on play testing the crap out of my game for a long time so it's definitely something I need to start planning for.

Delve's a campaign game, so one-shots don't test that very well, but I did use con games to find failure points I wouldn't have found otherwise.  But the 50-session game with my home group was the most important test.  Within My Clutches, on the other hand, is a pick-up-and-play game, so testing it with people who've never played it before is vital.  I've tried to rope non-gamer friends in to home games for that purpose, and that's gone well.  Plus a little convention play, but the sorts of folks who go to the cons I go to are only one specific niche of my intended audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465154/#Comment_465154" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-30T10:14:17+00:00" title="July 30, 2017 10:14AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try another way, has already been mentioned. That one work great, when I played it (as well as "Describe more in detail").<br/><br/>You can also use "Yes, but" to limit what someone has just said. If you want to make it more structured, create two roles. The head and the but. The head is on your left side, and the but on the right. You follow the head by building on what that person says, by saying "Yes, and", and you restrict the but by saying "Yes, but" and then makes up a complication or states something that limits what that participant just said.<br/><br/>A third option would be to set up a framework for what's not allowed, where the game has already state a few points, like "abandon the setting". The film-noir game <i>Nerver av St\xe5l</i> (Nerves of Steel) does this by setting up a framework for what wasn't allowed due to censorship during the 1930s era. You were allowed to curse, or show people having out of marriage sex. This created workarounds ("darn it" - or having two people putting on the last clothes in a bedroom).<br/><br/>Whenever someone oversteps this framework - anyone is allowed to stop the session and point it out. If this is part of the rules, then people will be more accepting of this happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21198/what-is-the-best-most-polite-language-to-frame-a-veto-in-a-story-game" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21198/what-is-the-best-most-polite-language-to-frame-a-veto-in-a-story-game" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21198/what-is-the-best-most-polite-language-to-frame-a-veto-in-a-story-game/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21198%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21198%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
