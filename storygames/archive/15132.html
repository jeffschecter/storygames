Here is my version:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen <b>your move directly relates to your Bond</b>, you may roll+Bond instead of the normal stat. If you do:<br/>\nOn a 10+, you and the target of that Bond gain XP. On a 7-9, you gain XP. On a 6-, you may increase or decrease your Bond with them by 1.<br/>\nThese effects are in addition to the normal effects of the move.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you guys think? Does this add anything? Is it basically something you've already been doing? Do I ask too many questions? How many licks DOES it take...?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343943/#Comment_343943" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-25T14:13:47+00:00" title="September 25, 2011  2:13PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not bad, not bad.

With this, you start from the fiction but don't go back into the fiction (you do go back into the fiction from the results of the regular move you're layering the Bond move on top of, but then it feels like the Bond move is a little toothless: there's no hard-wired fictional outcome from playing to your Bonds).<br><br>Taking this idea further, maybe each Bond has a <b>reinforce</b> move and a <b>buyoff</b> move, so something happens when you fictionally reinforce your Bond, and something big happens when you buy off your Bond (i.e., doing something to sever ties with your Bond or change the nature of your Bond completely).<br><br>Playing AW, I've often wished the Hx questions had more tooth in the game long-term, but thinking about it again, I'm not sure if it needs it: relationships change naturally through play, using the moves you already have. I've only played DW once, though, so maybe it's different here?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343989/#Comment_343989" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T01:49:43+00:00" title="September 26, 2011  1:49AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea here is to get folks thinking about their bonds, and to give them a metagame reason to make the fiction be about the relationships between the characters. In the same way that going along with a fellow PC's Seduction in AW nets you an XP, this gives an incentive to the player to have their character's bonds matter. Frankly, without it, Bonds come up...pretty much never (other than helping or hindering, which I never to my knowledge have read or heard about anyone using, but that's just anecdotal), unless a particular player happens to be jazzed about a given Bond for reasons of his own preferences. This move is about incentivizing the style of play I'd like to see, which is one where the Bonds mean something concrete to the players, and therefore come up in the fiction frequently.

It's saying it's a little more Smallville-esque, where your chance of stabbing a monster, recalling a bit of lore, or casting a spell depends on (some function of) how much this person matters to you, rather than how talented you are.<br><br>Is that still Dungeon World?  I'm not saying it's bad, but to me it is a change.  Along with appropriate amounts of XP-for-Treasure it could enable removal of highlighted stats.

No highlighted stats, with 3 of the 4 players who played Temple of Ungu last week.

I think it would be tempting to rewrite bond text similar to Beliefs/Keys (from BW and TSoY/LB, respectively) so that they did have fictional triggers; however, that might clash with the mechanical purpose of bonds which describe your ability to aid or interfere with a specific PC.  Bonds-as-keys could work (Alignments are basically keys) but they would not always explain why you were better or worse at aiding or interfering with that person.  <br/><br/>It also seems possible to have a textless bond with another player, one where that player has said at the end of a session that your character knows them better but for which you did not choose a bond at the beginning of the game.  You mark +1 bond but there is no text.  Perhaps the best solution is to simply rename bonds "relationships" and have the relationship give you the bonus to your bond with that PC.  That way the relationships get entered into the fiction but are separated from the mechanics (if that makes any sense).

I mean, Bonds are your character's relationships at the start of play. They kick you in the pants out of the gate.

There is both-<br>- your bond-as-relationship-or-backstory <br/>- your bond-as-ability-to-aid-or-interfere  <br/><br/>Only at character generation are they directly related, in that the number of 'type one' bonds (lets call them Relationships for now) sets the value of your 'type two' bond.  After that they divorce, and there is no feedback to Relationships from play or mechanical changes in Bond value at all.  And maybe the XP solution we're looking for is in the Keys thread, or maybe one of these proposals to rewrite Relationships needs to be adopted- if Relationships don't affect play mechanically, they become out of date like Hx questions, which would be a shame.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>I guess its that they feel like an opportunity to do something more but nothing has quite hit the nail on the head yet.</blockquote>\nI feel that.
