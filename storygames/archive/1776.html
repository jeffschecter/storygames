                    So, another side-track off from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1728" rel="nofollow"><b>"Intentions in Task-Based Resolution"</b></a>.  <br/><br/>So I have a beef with intent-based resolution.  First, I'll outline my interpretation of the problem of taking into account intentions.  In any resolution system, there is a potential problem if the player doesn't know what steps need to be done to get what they as a player are after.  <br/><br/>Here's an example.  Suppose the players know that someone was shot in a Dogs in the Vineyard game.  They want to catch the killer.  However, they can't simply resolve finding the killer in a single conflict -- and in that case they don't have a definite number of steps to get what they want.  <br/><br/>So the intent solution is that the player says what they're trying to eventually accomplish, and the GM guides them towards what steps they need to get there.  As Brand put in a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1728&amp;page=2#Item_74" rel="nofollow">late post on the thread</a>: <br/><br/><b>Brand_Robins</b> wrote: <blockquote>The big thing here is that because the Player isn't letting the GM know what his end goal is the GM can't help steer him at it until the end -- assuming the GM would want to steer the player. The player never knows which roll will end up with him at the sewers, or near the sewers, or if he can even get to the sewers. So pretty much he keeps trying different things until he finds one that will work. Task by task, no clear intent.</blockquote>
While this works, it's not ideal to me.  The problem is that before the example even starts, we have player ignorance.  The GM knows what the PC would need to do to accomplish his goal, but the player doesn't.  Both as GM and as player, I'd prefer to give the player enough information to accomplish things <i>before</i> resolution begins.  Then I don't have to steer the players, they can steer themselves.  <br/><br/>As a small-scale example of this, if I'm going to play out a combat in detail, I will generally lay out a diagram of the area and describe it.  Now, I could instead have my own vision and tell players what they would need to do to, say, surround an enemy.  But I find it is more interesting if the players can come up with plans that I wouldn't have thought of... as opposed to me steering them to a plan based on what they tell me they want.  <br/><br/>A particular pet peeve of mine is times when hiding intent is effective.  In my experience, when informed of the player's intent, the GM often makes it hard for them to get what they want -- in order to be challenging.  This leads to the intent paradox that the players can accomplish some things more easily if they <i>lie</i> (or at least are deceptive) about what they're trying to do.  In traditional games, this would often involve being deceptive about the PCs' plan.  In some recent resolution systems, this moves onto a meta-level where it can be easier to effect something if it <i>isn't</i> the stakes.                </div>

                            Interesting stuff.  I've been thinking a lot about frustrated player intentions and tasks, as you might have noticed, and those thoughts underlie a lot of my design approach.  I've seen all of those things you talk about, including players with hidden agendas, and to me, that's counter-productive because it undermines open communication.<br/><br/>The foundation of the traditional way of figuring out appropriate tasks is the idea that the GM is the decider of what works and what doesn't.  Coincidentally, this is one of those foundations that Beast Hunters blows out of the water.  In BH, because the "GM" has to offer a minimum advantage point gain for every action of the "player," any action works to at least some degree (unless the player decides to reject the offer).  The GM's offer reflects how well the GM believes it would work, but if the player disagrees, she can always resort to a roll of the dice.  In other words, it's no longer up to the GM to decide which actions fulfill the player's intent, it's up to the player.  At the same time, the GM retains a guiding but not deciding role.  And what you said here:<br/><br/><code>I find it is more interesting if the players can come up with plans that I wouldn't have thought of... as opposed to me steering them to a plan based on what they tell me they want.</code><br/><br/>That's exactly what my design is for.<br/><br/>In other words, you can achieve a more open-communication style in traditional games the way you describe, by laying out how things work and providing all the necessary information.  Or you can fundamentally change the distribution of authority through appropriate game design.  And then you leave less room for those kinds of frustrations.<br/><br/>Does it open the door for other kinds of frustrations?  Possibly.  Time will tell, I assume <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Is this a good summary: <i>Since the GM's job is to throw overcomable adversity in the way of the Player's stated goals (</i>i read intention as a different word<i>), it behooves a clever Player - who is competitive by nature - to make their true goal cryptic to the GM so it remains unopposed, and thus more likely to succeed, giving the Player what they want.</i><br/><br/>This is very interesting - Although i haven't observed it in my (limited) experience, I see this as being absolutely true, despite our best intentions to honestly engage with each other to create a story-like gaming experience.<br/><br/>Do you think it helps to clearly establish the intended rythym of game behaviour (eg: "the gm will directly challenge your character goals to make things go") with the participants prior to play? (this includes featuring it prominently in the rulebook, as an option)<br/><br/>Or is it not so easy to overcome our nature with out explicit mechanical assistance (a la Christian's statement above)?                        </div>

No, I wouldn't say that.  The GM may have an outcome (like the location of the sewer entrance) known in advance, so long as the players have a good idea what would be useful lines of investigation to find it.  i.e. as long as they can take actions without the GM having to steer them.  <br/><br/>For example, suppose that the campaign had been set in the court for a long time -- and the players have a lot of information on which to form suspicions about who would have knowledge about the sewer entrance.  Or perhaps they could set up a trick, leaving out bait for someone to steal who would head back to the sewers.  As long as the players have material to work with and are making informed decisions rather than blind guesses, then there isn't an inherent problem.                        </div>

What I've seen happen sometimes is this: the players spend time on fruitless investigation until their frustration bubbles up to the social contract level. "Hey," they tell the GM, "We're really <i>trying</i> here! Why aren't we getting anywhere?"<br/><br/>"I <i>gave</i> you all the hints you need!" counters the GM. "Why aren't you following <i>those</i> lines of investigation?"<br/><br/>The GM requires the player to act on "good idea[s of] what would be useful lines of investigation" -- but the GM alone determines what is good and useful. That's a form of steering the players, although it's certainly a form that many players cheerfully submit to.<br/><br/>I've only seen this happen in intent-irrelevant games. But to support your point, I can imagine it happening in intent-relevant games too. Even if you declare your intent to be "I get the dirt on the supervillian" and you win, there's not necessarily a mechanic telling whether that victory contributes to a later intent of "blackmail the supervillain into surrendering." The GM might rule, for example, that unbeknownst to the players, the supervillain doesn't care about the dirt they dug up.                        </div>

Well, i seems unlikely to happen as such in an intent-relevant game, because instead the GM is going to guide them through it.  I see it as sort of three levels: <br/><br/>1) What you describe: players at best blindly guessing what will work; GM doesn't guide them; they hit many red herrings and dead ends.  <br/><br/>2) Players blindly guessing what will work; but GM corrects and guides them to what will work.  <br/><br/>3) Players have the information to know what will work and not work without having to be guided.    <br/><br/>If I'm going to be information-starved, then I'd generally prefer <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  However, I'm saying that my ideal goes back to intent-irrelevant.  <br/><br/>Whether there is a GM or not seems secondary to me. In a GMless game, other players can trample over my plans or make them irrelevant -- just as a GM could in a GMed game.  As an example of what can happen in a GMless or distributed-authority game, consider:  One player works step by step on a careful plan about how to get past the bad guys; then another one uses narrative authority and just breezes on through.  Now the first player feels that his work was made irrelevant.  <br/><br/>I think the difference with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> lies in that what work and what doesn't is agreed on <i>prior</i> to the attempted actions -- rather than the player deciding what she wants to do, and then turning to some authority of how that can be accomplished.                        </div>

                            John, I have an issue with this thread, but I'm having a hard time articulating what exactly it is.<br/><br/>I think what it is, is that your post implies a certain style of play. But IME, games that utilize heavy "intent-driven" resolution don't follow that style (at least, not the better-designed games). Like Judd mentioned above, DitV is all about laying everything out in the open, and then seeing what happens. I'll give you that your example may not have been the best, so I won't keep nitpicking it, but many other intent-driven, IME, are similar to DitV.<br/><br/>That is, many intent-driven games (tMW, Sorcerer, PTA, many others)--or at least, the style with which I'm use to playing them--isn't about accomplishing a goal. It's about making decisions and dealing with the consequences of those decisions. In this style, there is no inherent endpoint that the player is trying to reach. Play is about generating interesting stuff. It's the process that's important, not the end point.<br/><br/>Now, I will give you that the issue you've described does exist, if you're using intent-driven resolution in goal-oriented play. But is it a surprise that different mechanics work better for different styles of play?                        </div>

They certainly can--however, if their first raise is "I accuse the Steward" and the Steward didn't do it and doesn't know who did--and every raise there-after is an attempt to pin the murder on the Steward, then the raises will be inappropriate. The same way that stumbling around in the dark for the sewer is. I'm not exactly sure what the protocol for that is, but I think the GM (as with anyone else) can refuse the raise on the basis that it's inappropriate.<br/><br/>Then the players might just have the PCs accuse each townsperson (and if the GM refuses it, then they know it wasn't him).<br/><br/>Another alternative is for the GM to play it out but have the act of the false-accusation lead to uncovering evidence that leads to the killer. This is a fine solution if the GM will buy it--but if the GM thinks the Steward doesn't know anything relevant, again, the GM needs to refuse the action (same as if the PC was accusing a rock and another player objected to that as being incredibly lame).<br/><br/>Similarly, in both DitV and Sorcerer, there is a phase of the game that can't really fail--figuring out what's behind the kicker/town--but still requires some sort of connection between the GM and Players to really work well. Declaring a "conflict to catch the killer" is the sort of thing that I think is likely to lead to a negative experience if more information isn't shared first (i.e. more steps are taken than simply knowing there was a murder).<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            Judd, <br/><br/>I've GMed a lot of Dogs at this point. And I have never had someone call a conflict of "I catch the killer" in that flat of a manner. Marco lists some reasons for that, and in addition everyone's sense of pacing would probably find it inapropriate. <br/><br/>Even if someone did declare that as a conflict I, as GM, would never leave it alone. I would, as the book clearly tells me to, push push push for a smaller (MUCH SMALLER) conflict. It was only if the whole group out-voted me that I'd ever go with that as a flat conflict, and I honestly can't see such a thing happening very often in actual play. <br/><br/>However... <br/><br/>John, <br/><br/>The above, the push for the smaller conflicts, is where Dogs AP tends to correct the issue that you've noted. I have had players ask for mighty huge conflicts (never "I figure out the whole town" but I have had "I make the person trust me explicity, tell me everything he knows, and spy on his mother and report back to me" all as one conflict) -- and when we negotiate out what the smaller conflicts that we'll actually play out we usually get a "chain of possibilities" situation that allows us to have a clearer sense of what will happen as the conflicts build up towards full resolution of the town. <br/><br/>So a chain like, "Why don't you get him to trust you first, and then do a followup to get him to spy on his mom" "Oh cool, and then could I do another conflict after that to use the mother to draw out the sex pervert?" happens, and helps us see a clear way from A to Z.                        </div>

                            A couple of replies here.  First of all, Timfire's question about goal-oriented play.  Here the topic that I'm talking about the pursuing of player goals.  That doesn't mean it is the center of all play, just that the players have in-game goals beyond the current roll of the dice.  To the extent that players don't care about their ability to reach those goals, then the potential problem I talk about doesn't apply -- and it equally doesn't apply regardless of the resolution system used.

I think we may have some miscommunication here.  I would distinguish between <i>failure</i> and <i>irrelevancy</i>.  Few resolutions system guarantee that you will progress towards your goal regardless of what choices you make and/or what you roll.  At least, I haven't covered these, and I'm not sure what they would be.  So I'm assuming that failure is possible, and thus regardless of what happens there may be "wasted effort" in the sense of trying something which does not succeed.  <br/><br/>If I have sufficient knowledge to approach a problem -- i.e. I'm not blindly guessing -- then I might fail, but it was an informed, reasonable attempt.  So I don't think of my effort as wasted.  Does that make sense?                        </div>

It does make sense: what I don't understand is how that is any different with intent-based resolution than with task-based resolution. In both cases it is helpful and satisfying to have all the information you need, up-front. How does this lead to a beef with intent-based resolution?                        </div>

                            Adam, <br/><br/>I think it has to do with the stages at which intent is parsed, and the fact that intent done at a scene or conflict level can still break down at a plot level. That is to say, many games with intent based resolution have perfectly valid and servicible ways to get what you want out of this conflict right here right now, but can then become vauge on how to get from that conflict to an end goal. <br/><br/>Example: If you're in a task-based non-intent game and you want to find the sewers you have to go through the process described in the thread John linked at the begining to get there. You never know exactly what you're doing or if it will get you there or farther away or what. OTOH, in say... Burning Wheel, where intent clearly matters, if you want to get to the sewers you'll frame it up and have a roll or series to get to the sewers. Boom, done. <br/><br/>But what if getting to the sewers was part of bringing down the king, which is one of your beliefs? Is that going to be done in one roll or series of rolls? I suppose you could, but most GMs and groups won't want to. Instead you'll need to get to the sewers then get the chancelor to help you, then get past the captain of the guard, etc. At that point even though you have a clear intent in each conflict to guide you the chain of conflicts can get into the same problem task resolution had -- you don't know if each conflict is getting you where you want to go in the larger scheme of things. <br/><br/>Burning Empires game structure, otoh, fixes this. Want to permanently defeate the Worm's threat? Well you know exactly what you have to do and exactly when you have to do it because the whole game is broken up into stages that guide the whole plot into a plot level intent based conflict resolution. <br/><br/>Most games, however, don't do that and I don't think it is always the preferable solution. (Though it rocks out in BE)                        </div>

You're right.  I agree that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is largely the same under either intent-relevant and intent-irrelevant resolution.  So more precisely, my main beef is with games where intent is <i>necessary</i> to have satisfying resolution (i.e. my #2).  <br/><br/>However, even under <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, the problem of hidden intent I mentioned later can rear its head.  I've seen this mainly in tactical or problem-solving games.  So, the players have enough information to make effective plans, and the GM wants to know what their plans are to prepare for it.  I recall in particular Mary Kuhner describing a bad case of this on rgfa -- where a GM of her's <i>genuinely believed</i> the adage "no plan survives contact with the enemy", and thus when he knew the PCs plan he would semi-consciously look for what could go wrong with it.  As a result, she found that when the players kept their plan at least partially hidden from the GM, they were more successful.

I agree with this in general, but I would note that resolving the challenge in a single roll isn't unique to intent-relevant resolution.  Rather, that's just a question of the scale of resolution for this purpose -- i.e. the Y axis of Fred's diagram.  In D20, you could just set a difficulty class for the information, and roll Gather Information against that DC.  Boom, done.  Many other games have similar.  For example, the Buffy RPG specifically encourages a one-roll research scene where the PCs collect information.  i.e. Roll once and boom, done.                        </div>

                            Here's an example of hidden player intent in Dogs that was relatively common when our group played it: Someone declares a conflict with stakes when their real intent is to Give on the conflict as soon as possible so they can get the die for cutting their losses.

Gotcha. So would you say that specifically in situations involving player ignorance, intent-based resolution sucks because the GM needs to "steer" the players around their ignorance?<br/><br/>If so, do you prefer the task-based method of dead ends and red herrings, because there's no GM steering?<br/><br/>Your peeve with systems that make it more effective to hide your intent than to be honest about it makes sense to me. But it can be a problem in task-based play too, right? Mary Kuhner's experience speaks to that. (Assuming it was task-based.) Is there any system that is <i>not</i> susceptible to such deception?<br/><br/>(I think I've even <i>done</i> that... if I just say, "My action is to leap across the chasm," the GM will make me roll for it. But if I say, "I fire at the orc! Oh, I need to be over here to get line-of-sight. Can I get across this chasm as part of my move?" the GM might handwave the chasm in order to get me to the roll he <i>thinks</i> I care about.)                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Cerling</cite>Gotcha. So would you say that specifically in situations involving player ignorance, intent-based resolution sucks because the GM needs to "steer" the players around their ignorance?<br/><br/>If so, do you prefer the task-based method of dead ends and red herrings, because there's no GM steering?</blockquote>
Well, neither.  In the case of player ignorance, I'd prefer that the scale of resolution be higher -- i.e. resolve more in a single check, so that any dead ends and other details of execution are folded into a single roll.  For example, in the case of finding the sewer entrance, it seems to me that if the players don't have any leads or context, this is exactly what the D&amp;D "Gather Information" skill is for.  Set a Difficulty Class, and the players roll a skill check against it.  Of course, there are plenty of other mechanics which can also handle this.  You can just as easily do this in a negotiated-stakes system or other more recent resolution systems.  <br/><br/>As long as the scale of the resolution is set according to this principle, I care less about how it is accomplished.  
<blockquote>Your peeve with systems that make it more effective to hide your intent than to be honest about it makes sense to me. But it can be a problem in task-based play too, right? Mary Kuhner's experience speaks to that. (Assuming it was task-based.) Is there any system that is<i>not</i>susceptible to such deception?<br/><br/>(I think I've even<i>done</i>that... if I just say, "My action is to leap across the chasm," the GM will make me roll for it. But if I say, "I fire at the orc! Oh, I need to be over here to get line-of-sight. Can I get across this chasm as part of my move?" the GM might handwave the chasm in order to get me to the roll he<i>thinks</i>I care about.)</blockquote>
Well, if the system is such that the player doesn't have to declare intent, then she can do as Mary did later and simply keep silent about her plans.  If the system <i>requires</i> (or at least explicitly calls for) intent, though, this is harder to do -- and you're more likely to run into it.  What Mary was playing under was intent-relevant resolution, because the GM was taking her intent into account in how resolution happened.  I don't have a position whether it would count as task-oriented or not, since I've had trouble with that term.                        </div>

Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I don't have a problem with intent-based chain-conflicts losing sight of the goal.  My issue with them is in some sense the opposite -- that they can be uninteresting succession of rolls where you're being led by the nose to the goal.  <br/><br/>If it's not being led by the nose, then I don't see the need for openly declaring intent.  (I don't have an inherent problem with declaring intent, just that it's not necessary.)  If he doesn't need to be led, the player can just steer the chain himself towards the goal without declaring intent.  <br/><br/>(Though I'm slightly suspicious here that different people might be talking about different things when we say "intent-relevant".)                        </div>

                            When i think of intent combined with a little goal &amp; a big goal, this is the picture i get:<br/><br/><br/>me: "Ok, so my guy is going to wait till night, and then sneak down into the sewers..."<br/><br/>other players: "um, wait - why?"<br/><br/>me: "Because he totally knows a segment of the seven section staff is down there, but he's got Glory-Hound and wants to be the first to find a piece!"<br/><br/>gm player: "Ok, cool - 'poof' - the first segment is hidden deep within the ancient sewer system; but since the place is a horrible maze, i'm making this a tough test of Pathfinding - if you fail you encounter He-Who-Dwells-Beneath..."<br/><br/><br/>...but that might just be me... (edit: this is my attempt at an example of a player-guided openly-declared intent process)                        </div>
