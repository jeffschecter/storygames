I've done this, in the past, and the story stuff winds up impacting the tabletop campaign that we're running -- so this minis game is kind of like a 'very special episode' that advances the plot.<br/><br/>But now I want to do a game with minis in which you have roleplaying and story and acts and dramatic choices. I'm sure that someone's posted about that here, but I can't find any threads.<br/><br/>So. Anybody done this? Any games actually do something like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376241/#Comment_376241" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T14:16:59+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  2:16PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the games that most commonly do this are played with action figures rather than minis.

Each player took a single "soldier" from a Rhodesian government backed merc squad and we played through an episodic "Tour of Duty" style series of games, mostly revolving around the various engagements, patrols and ambushes, although there were a couple of low combat missions that were actually really tense since we were expecting the hammer to fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach player got victory points for specific actions (mission objectives, kills, captures etc) as well as general experience awards for taking part in missions.  Very quickly, everyone had character backgrounds, cliched mannerisms/characterizations and specialities as the characters developed.  I played the squads machine gunner for eight games before I failed to spot a sniper who could actually shoot...... Deaths tended to be fairly traumatic as it meant a loss of experienced squad mates and a randomly generated replacement for the unit.  Some of the best scenes/missions/battles were recoveries of wounded personnel.  Actually a very cool game and something I would like to recreate again, although probably in a different and less contentious conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376342/#Comment_376342" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T05:08:23+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  5:08AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, we used to do this regularly in the late 80's, early 90's with the original Rogue Trader Skirmish rules (WH40K). We'd play out the battles then have some cool roleplay with the odd non combat roll thrown in, and then set up the next scene in the campaign. Good memories, and I still fondly read the rulebook from time to time as the story hooks in there are gold.<br/><br/>I've been using HALO Megabloks for 3:16 in 'table-top' battles too, they are awesome for the troopers, and any alien I can get my hands on for the beasties. I Love 3:16.<br/><br/>Isn't D&amp;D 4e sorta like this in 'default mode'. Not that we have been playing this way, but I'm sure you could go the <i>Descent</i> series route and have it more like a Dungeon Skirmish Campaign game, with a little role playing thrown in between combat encounters to tie the battle sequences together <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376348/#Comment_376348" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T06:26:41+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  6:26AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NCLivingBrit, that is exactly what I'm talking about!

While the period is weird, the methods work for any story/miniatures game. <br/><br/>The trouble I've encountered running story games with war games is that the war over powers the story or the story ignores the war. Unless the story is a war movie that focuses on battle miniatures rules get in the way. I used to be primarily a war gamer but have grow bored by the flow of play in war games. One side attacks and either wins or loses - often games end as soon as the tide turns so the collapse and route are not played. So much good story is lost because of this. <br/><br/>In case the link doesn't work, the game I ran was a Matrix game. A turn consists of one player adding something to the story. The other players may challenge it one at a time to replace it. The two players roll 2d6, the high roller wins, their action happens. If there are no challenges the addition automatically happens. After that is resolved everyone gets to move the game pieces they champion. While everyone has a faction they move around, the game focuses on one main character. Players decide up front if they want this character to do well or not. The good players make things happen that help that character, the bad players try to make the hero's life a living hell. Along the way they get to move minor figures in and out of the action. The scene the players are working on can change at the end of any turn. A player just points to a new spot on the table and says what is happening there. If is very free form and loose but it works.

Here are a few things i've found or considered, or both.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Folks don't get as attached to characters, at least not right away</span><br/><br/>I know a few folks around here in threads about using minis have really gone out of their way to really stress the fact that they don't feel nearly as much first person attachment to their characters when using minis.I believe them, having heard it more than enough. OTOH, I kinda look at it as if this is a different form of imaginative play, and not one where first-person attachment to characters is as important. Instead I recommend going into this kind of play as someone playing it or running it with foreknowledge that this is a likely feeling. It's okay though, because it does allow for a more removed stance where players can say things about characters and even do some of that stuff that is a no-no in other contexts, like advocating for the characters to be important to the story and have interesting things happen to them, rather than advocating as a first person champion of the character. And that's fun all on it's own.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dump as much written anything as possible</span><br/><br/>Seriously. Dump rule books, cheat sheets, character sheets, all that junk. Get it as far away from the table as possible. if you can't dump it entirely, move it away from the table. Only bring it out when absolutely necessary. if you're doing post game write ups or blue booking, put it online and keep the comuters away from the table too. It encourages people to get up, move around and concentrate one what they're seeing and to engage with the tactile element of using minis.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you don't want it to be a wargame, in the nitty gritty tactical sense, stop using wargaming type rules.</span><br/><br/>Weird but run with this for a second. Are you familiar with <i>Fiasco</i>? You could very easily hack Fiasco for use a s a core engine for minis play. The set up stuff would be trickier, but the core in play part where people either choose to set up a scene and let their friends resolve it (good or bad), or the reverse, could work just as well with miniatures play as with normal non-minis<i> Fiasco </i>play. In fact, lots of stuff from non-tactical, non-map using play can be used with minis in slightly modified forms and give a much different sort of game than the usual minis using game firefight feel.<br/><br/>Edit: Heck, it would even be simpler to hack Archipelago II for use with minis than <i>Fiasco</i>. Here's the hack for it: Instead of drawing the initial map, use your minis collection to layout a table. make characters inspired by some of the available minis. During play, free-play with the minis in addition to all the usual sorts of play. So, y'know, show <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> tell  the events of the story. Other than that, use<i> Archipelago II </i>as-is.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you're going to go hardcore with minis use, go hardcore and make it a focus</span><br/><br/>What I mean is this: Lay out a big damn table of stuff, and keep it mostly as is throughout play. Don't try to re-arrange too often, don't try to let too much imaginative content in for the session that can't be pretty well represented by the toys, and do try to match up the minis to the imaginative stuff as best able. So yes, backstory, personalities, dialogue- all that kind of stuff is fair game to add in. It doesn't really matter to the minis side of things. <br/><br/>Having a mini of a baker being used as a knight? Poor form, unless that knight is mostly a baker,or in disguise, or baking is somehow that knight's real interest in life and the player running the character brings that up regularly in an interesting way. Likewise, don't use a telephone booth as a spaceship/time-machine. Unless you want to, but you see what I mean.<br/><br/>Hope some of those suggestions help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376505/#Comment_376505" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T18:15:18+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  6:15PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems legit! Thanks for all the great pointers!<br/><br/>FWIW, I only do homebrew systems, because my core gaming group handles my RPG rulebooks in the manner of a Kubrickian apes before the monolith. The rules have to fit on the back of an index card, or else my group gets lost. Also, there's five of them, and they all have something to say, so crunchy systems just don't work. The more streamlined, the better. But with lots of dice, because they just love rolling dice.<br/><br/>I love both Archipelago 2 and Fiasco. But again, my group loves their dice. They don't always know why they're rolling, FSM bless them, but they love to hear the clattering sound and watch all those little dodecahedrons roll around.<br/><br/>So far, my best experience with this sort of thing (story gaming with minis) was during a superhero game where Batman and Wolverine and The Thing all had to fight Red Skull and Joker and all those guys, and the characters were already very well-defined.<br/><br/>My second-best experience was a dungeon crawl using fantasy heroes that we'd already played some RPG sessions with, and for the dungeon crawl I built this big dungeon on an eight-foot table, and that went really well, but it wasn't as epic, because there weren't any Skrull or Brood or what-have-you, threatening to destroy the Earth. And also it was more like, go in this room, search for traps, fight the ghoul, et cetera. Fun, and perhaps more story-driven, because we had already spent a year with the characters. But at the same time, there's something about pretending to be Wolverine, right?<br/><br/>So my goal is to find a game that actually does this kind of thing, because sometimes it's fun to just use someone else's system. But no luck so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376515/#Comment_376515" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T18:52:01+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  6:52PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Archipelago II at a miniatures table is perfectly reasonable and sounds awesome.

I found a company that sells a whole slew of colors of blank dice and printable stickers that fit in the frames on each side.<br/><br/>Another way is simply to have stuff like Mythic GM Emulator around and use just the main two charts.

There is a massive chapter on the setting, ideas for campaigns, with rules for character advancement, what happens to long-term wounds and injuries and even a plot generator with multiple paths to victory and experience. There is also one of the best chapters on converting 'junk' into terrain. The rule system is, well...... Warhammer. But that's ok. You can make it more detailed with a few extra rules, especially morale and skill checks and non-combat objectives. When WHFRP Ist Ed came out with skills and careers and what not, we just made equivalents for Rogue Trader. I remember having a Squat (space dwarf) pirate named Darius Benelux with a cutthroat band of eldar, human and ogryn badasses (all personality profiles) who was eventually taken over by entities from the warp and went mad, taking down a whole smuggling planet with him an his chaotic crew.

In this game players specifically choose objectives based on their faction, their character and a range of other choices (almost like keys in The Shadow of Yesterday). The only thing the game is missing is the opportunity to generate your own characters.<br/><br/>Otherwise there is a great campaign system for storytelling opportunities in the 3rd edition of the miniatures game Confrontation (with a great system for character advancement and development). The down side is that the manufacturer went bankrupt when they seriously butchered their rules and shifted from metal to pre-painted plastic figures. The positive side is that there's talk of bringing back this version of the game under a new company.<br/><br/>I've run some great stories with both sets of rules, in both cases running several sessions with lots of action and intriguel; while in some sessions there was hardly any "violent fighting" at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376748/#Comment_376748" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T11:50:20+00:00" title="May  6, 2012 11:50AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>You need to beat your friends more regularly and thoroughly.</blockquote>\nWell, in their defense, it's not that they're resistant to such things, but most of them never gamed until they met me. They knew the basics of D&amp;D, having played computer RPGs, but all the other stuff has been new to them. I'm about to introduce them to diceless gaming (first session of Fiasco this Wednesday -- not exactly diceless, but pretty doggone close). Up until now, they've associated gaming with dice, so plunging them into an Archipelago game with minis is going to be a short sharp shock that might not produce the best results. I'd rather ease them into this stuff, as there's no rush. I think the Fiasco game is going to be a real eye-opener. After that, who knows?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>You could easily map the "yes, but..." resolution to dice.

I figure those should cover most things.<br/><br/>Simple single throw quality of success rolls, as suggested by Graham in Cthulhu Dark. Any participant can call for the simple d6 roll, and the roll tells how well or poorly someone succeeded. high rolls are good and basically go off without a hitch. Very low rolls add complications to the success which may be immediate or may lay seeds for future complications.<br/><br/>Simple opposed rolls, as per some forms of Matrix Games when two players have different ideas of what could happen. Might be directly opposed, in fiction stuff,or could relate to higher level, almost player level stuff. everyone really needs to agree to roll with which way the die-roll competition comes off and not attempt to negate without some sort of further in-fiction groundwork being laid down.<br/><br/>Could vary the above by having possibility of different sizes of die used to indicate relative strengths of player positions/proposed outcomes.<br/><br/>If you have Mythic GM Emulator handy, consider using it for sparking ideas for scenes or ongoing threads.You might want to dump the concept of PCs and NPCs in favor of ome other approach, like Main characters and secondary characters.<br/><br/>Somebody will have used minis before, probably in the tactical sense. have few ideas ready on how to very simply handle those kinds of actiony events on the fly. imple roll combat, even lumpy combat, maybe a few ideas on who goes firts and so on. How far does somebody move, for example compared to someone else in a slo-mo scene. Don't get overly technical here. Kids don't when they play with their action figures. you don't really need to here either. Thinks about usinf David berg's action/scene arc thingie from Delve as another tool to speed up or slow down actions based on player interest.<br/><br/>Depending on how you want to go with things Rafael, it might be worth it to just plain tell your players you have a cool idea for a "game", you're experimenting, and you want their help seeing how it works out. That's kinda where I'm at in my thinking. <br/><br/>One of these days, I'm going to try to hash out some concepts about this kinda thnking, the stuff i'm calling Imaginative Miniatures Play (IMP). It's all cocked up, borrows from a bunch of different games and so forth. Really, it's just meant as facilitated ( that's you or me or whover is putting the event day together acting as facilitator) toy play informed by games ( whether minis games, RPGs or non-minis RPGs and story games). If your players are at all like my players, they don't bother to learn rules anyway prior to play, and then sometimes never really do.<b> And that is okay for this</b>. It isn't really meant to be competitive, it is meant more to be casual play and to wallow in source material inspired by the minis collection and the kernel of a set up idea brought by the person hosting things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit" title="NCLivingBrit"><img alt="NCLivingBrit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit">NCLivingBrit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376798/#Comment_376798" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T14:25:35+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  2:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: RafaelNCLivingBrit, that is exactly what I'm talking about! Yegads, that game sounds intense. What system did you use?<br/>\n<br/>\nLove the idea of specific victory points.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid all of the backgrounds and characterizations emerge from the mechanics, or was it just organic?<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginally, the characters were just roles in the squad ("Sapper, Sniper, Grenadier" etc) but after a while they got real-boy names and backstory and got fleshed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system was some 80's small unit system that had been extensively modified by the guy running the game, I forget which system it was sorry.  I have actually had good luck with Mongoose's Gangs of Mega City 1 skirmish rules, as they are already designed for character development and gang progression.  You just need to cook up theme specific gear/weapon/mission/etc. charts.  If you use GOMC1 I will warn you that in a 2-sided campaign the first victory can make the winner verrrry difficult to catch up with by the weakened opponent since they get loot and XP that bump them up fairly fast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377956/#Comment_377956" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T13:58:33+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  1:58PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GOMC1, eh? I will look into this!<br/><br/>I'm thinking that in lieu of a two-sided campaign, I'm hoping to find a way to create a co-op experience, with all players controlling individual characters (or small groups of characters) against an AI-controlled enemy force. And by that, I mean an enemy force that behaves semi-randomly, with players rolling dice to see what the bad guys do, or with rules that control bad guy actions (if a player gets within 5 squares, the bad guy always moves to attack, that kind of thing). So it's kind of like this GMless story that unfolds, with backstories and emotional connections that impact the numbers (dice, hit points, accuracy, whatever).<br/><br/>Still mulling this one over, but thanks for the input -- that goes for NCLivingBrit and everyone else who posted in this thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378060/#Comment_378060" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T06:51:27+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  6:51AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could always use Mythic GME to control the bad guys.
