BW is tight and has a lot of cool ideas, but I feel like I as a GM and us as a group need a somewhat easier, even looser, system. And I've always had a soft spot for TSOY, even though I've only tried it once (or twice, if you count the super short demo that Jason ran at Viking Con). <br/>But I'm really on the fence about it. I'd like to see how Artha performs over a longer period, and I'd love to have "levelling up"-sessions, where we focus on training and learning Skills.
