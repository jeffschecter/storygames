I've started thinking about PAX (Prime and East) 2011. What can we do to make those events even better? <br/><br/>Make it official - get support from the PAX staff.<br/>Get on the PAX 10<br/>Set times for games (but no scheduling)<br/>Get a mention in the event program<br/>Have more people available to run games (maybe by offering badges if you run X games)<br/>Do an indie games panel<br/><br/>(Based on my blog post <a href="http://www.latorra.org/2010/09/10/thinking-about-pax-2011/" rel="nofollow">here</a>)<br/><br/>Anyone else have suggestions?

I don't know if there was freeplay going on late into the evening (it sounds like not so much, with folks going off to private parties), but that seems like a missed opportunity to me.<br/><br/>Some other ideas based on things I saw around me:<br/>* An experience point card (or similar) where you get points for playing different story-games and can win some swag if you play enough<br/>* A bigger selection of games and convention scenarios so that people can play with little or no supervision<br/>* Some information in swag form that helps match gamers up to games they haven't played before<br/><br/>I am so down with helping with this in any way I can!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292948/#Comment_292948" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T21:21:21+00:00" title="September 10, 2010  9:21PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My biggest concerns:<br/><br/>1.) No signage in the indie location.<br/>2.) I felt like I was fighting for space.<br/><br/>My biggest appreciations:<br/><br/>1.) Sage, by the door, with a spread of indie games, and a friendly smile for strangers.<br/>2.) Good energy.<br/><br/>And so building on those things...<br/><br/><b>Have a welcoming area</b>, with a big poster that explains what we're doing, little fliers explaining "story games are X. We're doing Y. Approach us and ask about Z, and we can play a game." Don't do this to replace the smiling Sage, but to augment and to lighten the load. Have others step up and be the friendly smiling Sage from time to time, because that man worked his ass off.<br/><br/><b>Strengthen partnership with The Dreaming</b>, who're keen to celebrate and support indie RPGs. They've said that they would love to sponsor an indie RPGs room: an RPGs/etc booth run by The Dreaming, a bunch of tables, us, and our games. The Dreaming was awesome enthusiastic about indie RPGs and partnering with us this year. They took a 20% cut off the cover price of any books they sold through their booth, which is a pretty damn reasonable cut IMO.<br/><br/><b>Have a clear set of expectations for indie games room posse/volunteers/crew/team.</b> Which means: organize. Have people step into leadership roles. Delegate responsibilities. Expect commitment. Sage did a fucking awesome job of organizing and representing and facilitating this year. I want infrastructure and friends behind him so that he doesn't burn himself out and crawl away into a corner. Which means: have people step up and say "Sage, do you need a person from 12-6 on Saturday?" And Sage can say, "Yeah, PERSON A is in charge of scheduling manpower, talk to them. We definitely need people who're willing to just play house for an hour and greet strangers, if you're down for that."<br/><br/><b>Dedicated space.</b> We need to secure it. Through The Dreaming, through PAX organizers, or through armed militant action. We need a space that we don't need to fight for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292960/#Comment_292960" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T23:21:46+00:00" title="September 10, 2010 11:21PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have they made an announcement about opening up the PAX 10 to non-videogames or is that a battle we'd have to fight?<br/><br/>Schizoid was in the PAX 10 a couple years back - the bump in sales was almost unnoticeable...  unlike, say, the IGF, I felt like there wasn't a lot of awareness about it. <br/><br/>Look it me, what a naysayer.

For me, this year, I was with a lot of video-game-enthusiast friends and was torn between wanting to stay and play Story Games and wanting to play video games.<br/><br/>I think, like Joe said, having some dedicated space and some clear expectations of who is doing what.  That said, we don't want to turn this into work.  Everyone should still be having fun!

I think maybe a good way to start the indie conversation is to say "Hey, that style of game you already like? We have a different way of doing that, and we think it's pretty cool, want to try it?"<br/><br/>I say that DW's only real similarity to D&amp;D is the trappings of, ya know, dungeons and dragons and spells and such. The fiction genre. And people are already pretty aware you can go outside of that genre in RPGs: Wizard's is doing Post-apocalypse, Wheaton blogs about Fiasco and Penny, etc.<br/><br/>Mechanically, DW is a whole heck of a lot more like AW. Which is something I like the idea of people learning more about.<br/><br/>So, my pitch for why DW would be a good PAX 10 game to show off indie RPGs is pretty much the same reason Joe doesn't like it: it's familiar fictional setting with indie mechanics that (will someday) rock. I <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> Fiasco to death, but I think DW might have a better chance of working for a traditional gamer group just trying something indie for the first time without someone knowledgable at the table.<br/><br/>Not to say something a little further out there couldn't be a hit, but I don't think DW is a bad first step.

I'm not sure how best to approach this. While I really like the idea of support from IPR, the Dreaming, whoever, I also like the idea of the indie room being a non-commercial thing.<br/><br/>I think my dream setup (speaking for me only, as someone with nothing to sell) is an indie games room with no official connection to vendors being run as an official PAX event. If people want to buy stuff, we steer them towards the awesome folks at IPR, Dreaming, Gamma Ray, Compleat Strategist, etc. I'm all for people buying stuff and supporting all those great folks, but I kind of like the demo room being non-sales driven, so we can talk about games without any sales pressure, real or imagined.<br/><br/>Now that may not be possible, or it may not be the best thing (I know a couple of people have already called me on it). If the only way to have a real indie room, or to have the best indie room possible, is to coordinate with vendors, I'm all for it. Ideally with multiple sponsors, cause I'd hate to lock out IPR in favor of Dreaming or vice versa.<br/><br/>I'll be trying to get in contact with PAX people later this week to start the discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293246/#Comment_293246" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T15:04:20+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  3:04PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seminars bringing attention to indie games is mainly why they are popular at PAX.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy seminar suggestion:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to prototype your video game ideas quickly and cheaply using tabletop games.<br/>\n<br/>\nMobile games are exploding and console game sales are declining.

You can't dismiss Fiasco's success "because Wheaton liked it." Of course it did well because Wheaton liked it. So making sure that Wheaton, Krahulic, Holkins, Frontalot, Coulton, and anyone else that a bunch of people will file into a room to see talk through a microphone get ahold of our games is a priority at PAX. The Geek Nights guys have been talking about Luke and Jared's games at panels for awhile now, and the correlation to their success at PAX is plain to see. It's a good relationship; it's advocacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is no new thing. Getting you game into Ken Hite's hands, or Paul Tevis' has been an important step at Gencon and other major gaming cons. It's not a new strategy, it's just new advocates. Learn who the PAX crowd listens to and bust ass to make that connection.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293261/#Comment_293261" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T16:40:32+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  4:40PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>Getting things in the hands of people who the crowd listen to is a priority.

He told people to check it out, who also loved it because it is good.  That's all.<br><br>You're right, though.
