Was just wondering, cause a lot of times what we think kids like, they don't.<br/><br/>My kids of 8 and 5 seem to like:<br/><br/>- To do things, both narratively and physically while playing.  From rolling dice to jumping over a rope to represent hopping between buildings.  Once I bought a large cloth painting tarp and spread it out on the floor.  I drew a rickety bridge in thick sharpie with planks missing and had them cross it however they wanted.  <br/>- To control the story.  They fight for the right to narrate.  This becomes interesting as the 5 year old is a girl, and her narration tends towards one end of the spectrum of fantasy and the 8 year old's towards the other.<br/>- To help people versus to get things.  They don't care about treasure.<br/>- They don't like backstory.  At all.<br/>- When they are engaged, they are 100% engaged.  However, no matter how engaged, after 45-60 mins, they are done.  Moving on.  <br/><br/>Just some thoughts.  How do your kids play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269114/#Comment_269114" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T06:57:54+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  6:57AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2010 6:59AM by Teataine.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I don't have kids of my own but I have two nephews and two nieces between the ages of 5 and 9, with whom I often play. Not RPGs, but we do a lot of pretend. They all love to be pirates. The eldest girl is more interested in pretending to be a cook or "housekeeper" which I find interesting if not amusing.<br/><br/>The engagement issue is definitely there. When they get into something, they won't drop it and will pursue it without pause. But you never know when that switch is going to flip and they'll just wander off to do something else.<br/>They love to boss the fiction and others: "I'm the captain!". And when you suggest and alternative course they're often "No, silly, it doesn't go like that, it goes like *this*!". So basically, they already have their fiction set straight in their heads and have trouble sharing/compromising it. When it overlaps it's great, but arguments can pop up very easily. The other day we built this...square out of old bricks. And some of the time it was a fortress and some time a ship and some time a house. And the pile of cut grass kept switching from being our bed to being our lunch...And they kept arguing which was which and *when* it was which. Also, no patience for sitting down and just talking. Something has to be going on.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing was (although I have no idea how it relates to this thread), I tried to tell them a story, and they corrected me and asked me questions as kids do, and it got even more confusing because suddenly it was not clear at all whether we were pirates going after a treasure, or pirates resting and telling a story about how they went after treasure or pirates assaulting a fortress...it got all mixed up, the real world, the play pretend world, the world in the story.<br/><br/>/random ramblings off                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269118/#Comment_269118" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T07:09:05+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  7:09AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Here's the first four pages of my thing, The Wildlings.<a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/wildlings/wildlings.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.onesevendesign.com/wildlings/wildlings.pdf</a>For a D&amp;D starter, I would have done everything differently than WotC did.

They'd be kinda miffed that they couldn't create their own character (since their imaginations are much more vivid than WOTC...my godson would be saying something about wanting to play a Monkeyman Ninja...), and that there isn't some way to pick their own weapons or spells. They may be kids, but they like crunch. And also, considering they grew up looking at normal game books, and have been spoiled with video games, yeah, they'd want much better art. They'd want something closer to a comic book.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, there was a Japanese game based on the anime series Fortune Quest that would fit the bill for a good kids' RPG. It had sample characters as well as make-your-own characters, no set races, no set classes, and there were a bunch of punch-out cards with equipment, spells, and monsters, so it had a bit of the collectible card-game feel. AND it had cut-out masks of different characters they could wear. Now THAT is catering to the younger generation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269124/#Comment_269124" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T08:08:29+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  8:08AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice work, John.

I'll see what I can put together by this weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269358/#Comment_269358" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-28T14:03:27+00:00" title="April 28, 2010  2:03PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm hyped for Wildlings - it's definitely the indie version of "Monster Slayers" and much cooler in design and execution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269376/#Comment_269376" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-28T17:05:04+00:00" title="April 28, 2010  5:05PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh hey, totally coincidentally, I was in the game store today and there was the new Lone Wolf Multi-Player Gamebook from Mongoose on the shelf, and I picked it up because it looked pretty cool, actually, and reminded me of my formative pseudo-roleplaying experiences.<br/><br/>I only flipped through it a bit just now, but it looks way, WAY better than anything I've seen from WOTC as far as kids games, even though it does build on some prior experience with Lone Wolf books.  It's kinda like if Joe Dever wrote Mouse Guard, which is pretty cool, even though it obviously has some retro values and mechanics derived from the solo gamebooks.  Like, you're still supposed to use that stupid random number table and cross check the result on a table with your associated stat.<br/><br/>But the included adventure is somewhere in between Lone Wolf and Mouse Guard.  I'm totally serious.  Like, you have set battles and set rolls you have to make that aren't battles (like jumping across the rooftops chasing someone).  And the part that's super genius -- yes, I realize this may be the first time anybody said that about a Mongoose product -- is there are actual, real, meaningful choices for the players to make, since -- in the Lone Wolf tradition -- it's a highly branched railroaded path instead of just a straight line from here to there. Like, in the GM's instructions it's like "read this passage and then ask the players what they do.  If they do X, turn to page 68.  If they do Y, turn to 77."<br/><br/>I'm actually really interested to play through it, preferably with some other folks who grew up with Lone Wolf, to see if it's actually fun and dynamic in play, rather than just being a retro Lone Wolf fanfic tool (which is already pretty sweet, I have to say).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269386/#Comment_269386" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-28T22:18:22+00:00" title="April 28, 2010 10:18PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For anyone interested in designing for kids, I recommend checking out "Roleplaying with Kids" by Technomancer Press.

Yet the system has to make sense somehow; you can't just have random willy-nilly facts. You have to have an organized taxonomy, something that makes internal sense.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269441/#Comment_269441" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T08:49:36+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  8:49AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>For anyone interested in designing for kids, I recommend checking out "Roleplaying with Kids" by Technomancer Press.

I'll look into that book since I didn't know he'd contributed.
