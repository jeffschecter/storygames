I started out doing that pretty well.  But then i got stuck on the second game:  Ammo.  For reasons beyond my control, and to honor the Queen, i've been stuck in a downward spiral of game design that can't seem to escape 'hacking' my own stupid game.<br/><br/>But, whatever.<br/><br/>Instead of 'revising' and 'fixing' my existing game, i've decided to just write 'sequels.'  I'm not going to say i'm 'happy' with this version, just that i'm done learn'n from it.  So i timidly offer to you my sequel to <i>Ammo:  Revenant War</i>.  This one's called <i>Amm02:  Deus Vs. Machina.</i>  Unexpectedly, and out of sheer curiosity, i'm actually asking you to take this seriously.<br/><br/>Seriously, i really am.<br/><br/>If you dig, please write me back here or ask for my email.  If you hate the game please explain why.  If you have any advice or stuff you'd like to add (especially ideas for cool Ammo) do all of the above.<br/><br/>Game is available here:  <a href="http://metagate.wikidot.com/local--files/ammorpg/Amm02_web.pdf" rel="nofollow">a Link</a>  With more at metagate.wikidot.com/ammorpg.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325698/#Comment_325698" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T14:57:49+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  2:57PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!
