                    I'm stuck!  I'm completely stuck!  I have some more background text to write, but that's about all I have left until I can untie the Gordian Knot of these rules!  ACK!<br/><br/>Ok, as quick a rundown as I can manage:<br/><br/>The group plays a team of time travelers.  In this vision of time travel, in order to avoid any one person gaining access to all the various skills necessary to time travel (due to some early close-calls with mad scientists), the skills (called Functions) are distributed - one for each member of the team, called a Pod.  The pod travels back in time on a bubble of hypercurved 5d-space (hence the name).<br/><br/>The functions are:<br/><br/>Connect: This character moves the Speaker, the objects of the Maker, or the forces of the Mover into and out of the timeline.<br/><br/>Speak:  This character enters the timeline in order to interact with the people of the time.<br/><br/>Know: The Know function senses the exact location of the disturbance in the timeline, and to detect whether the actions taken by the Pod have been successful.<br/><br/>See: The Seer records every aspect of the PodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission, both within Pod and in the timeline.<br/> <br/>Make:  Makers fabricate objects that may be required to fulfill a repair to the timeline, including any costumes required by the Speaker.<br/><br/>You'll notice that there are two important functions missing - traveling through space and time.  That's because those two functions are distributed between all of the members of the pod, and all of the members must concur before a move in space and time is accomplished.<br/><br/>There's one last job, that of the Engineer, who acts like the Operator in <i>The Matrix</i> - he/she stays behind in the 'present' to ground the Pod (which actually never moves from the spot) in their reality and monitor the situation.  This is the 'GM', only without any authorial control - basically a referee.<br/><br/>A traitor is someone who, through their own hubris or some other reasoning, decides that they can do what everyone else has failed at - learn and take control of all the Functions and master time.  Since this historically and inevitably causes havoc, traitors are put to death when they're discovered.<br/><br/>All of this is prologue.<br/><br/>The game, as envisioned, takes place in two sessions separated by two weeks.  In the first session, the Pod plays out a time-repair mission, hunting down a traitor.  At the end of the first session, they lose contact with the Engineer, and failsafe back to the present to find it completely devastated.  Only the emergency hyperbolic field around the facility has kept it from succumbing to a massive change in the timeline.  A last transmission from the Engineer confirms that the traitor is not only alive and well, but is in the Pod.  One of the players is the traitor, and they've not only not fixed the past, but made it worse.<br/><br/>In the second session, the Pod has to go back and figure out who among them is the traitor, how they sabotaged the past, and fix it.<br/><br/>Ok.  Got all that?  Now, here's my problem:<br/><br/>I have no idea how to frame this game's mechanics.  The whole idea was (originally) that the players would, using a token-bid mechanic, create an official narrative in the first session, working together.  Using any leftover tokens, however, they could make (or appear to make) amendments to this official log, so that when they come back in the second session, things are not quite as they were in the first.  However, since two weeks of real time have passed and the players are only allowed to take cursory notes (on one side of a 3x5 card), the idea is that they either will or won't remember the way things 'really' happened - but if they do remember and can convince everyone that something has changed, they're one step closer to finding the traitor.<br/><br/>So in the second session, the players aren't acting in concert anymore, they're in competition - using a twisted version of the bid process to create a metanarrative  on top of the original one, where they implicate one character or another as the traitor.  "It turns out that the circuit board that Bodi Made was faulty - on purpose - and it caused Flight 11 to miss the World Trade Center!"<br/><br/>But I just ... can't ... get my hands around this fucking thing.  Every angle that I take, it just slips away from me.  I'm hoping that maybe a question or a comment or a suggestion will crystalize this for me in time.  I'm not married to the token system, necessarily - so if that looks like the problem, I can ditch it.<br/><br/>Help me, Obi Wan - you're my only hope!                </div>

                            This is a brilliant game concept!<br/>
<br/>
You could have them have to invest tokens together in the first half of the game to show how the are a team, the gm recording how many tokens anything cost.  In the second phase of the game now that the team is broken, you spend you own tokens to change something.  If you spend a token you can implicate someone else, if you match or exceed the bid amount from the previous game then you can completely alter it.  <br/>
<br/>
Can players spend together in the 2nd phase?<br/>
<br/>
Does The Traitor doesn't know who he is?<br/>
<br/>
I think I'd rather know I was the traitor than be told I was the traitor.  <br/>
<br/>
can players spend tokens to implicate the operator?<br/>

This may be a little Paranoia-esque, but what if _all_ the players were traitors and the focus is on which of them gets caught/implicated/takes the blame....                        </div>

That's the idea - that everyone has the potential (and the secret desire) to be the traitor - it's just a matter of pinning someone else with it first.                        </div>

                            So you want to be number 2?  (That would kind of make it like that rejected alternate scoring rule for Roach, if you let tokens build up (or be used up.))                        </div>

                            You might be able to use an evolved version of the Wolf in Sheep's Clothing play style variant I wrote for the Dead of Night RPG. <br/>
<br/>
Wolf in Sheep's Clothing works a little bit like the Werewolf party game. But a little different, since there's a "silent bid" for when the hidden monster/wolf/traitor attacks another PC. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, evolving this method would require that you be interested in a bidding-style mechanism for the Traitor's role.                        </div>
