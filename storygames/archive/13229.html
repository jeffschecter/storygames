I bought the PDF for it a few years ago, but I've never managed to get it to the table, for various reasons.  It occurred to me that it might be a good game to run around Halloween.  But I could use some advice/help from anyone that's run it before.<br/><br/>First, a few concrete questions: Can it be run effective as a one-shot?  What's the optimal number of players?<br/><br/>Then a more vague question: How would you recommend prepping for a game like this?  That's the biggest thing that intimidated me when I read it before, I believe.  I just wasn't sure how to approach it.  How much should the GM determine ahead of time things, and how much should be decided on the fly or developed in play?<br/><br/>I appreciate any input anyone can give me!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297795/#Comment_297795" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T11:47:58+00:00" title="October 21, 2010 11:47AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2010 11:59AM by Steve_Hickey.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Brian,<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nzrag.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=1871" rel="nofollow">I ran the Farm as a one-shot</a> a couple of years ago, and found it extremely satisfying. My post <a href="http://www.nzrag.com/bb/viewtopic.php?p=19621#19621" rel="nofollow">here</a> describes how I tried to fit it all into one session, but I'll copy it here, too:<br/><br/>Here's how I tried to fit all six weeks of the residents' stay on the Farm into one 3-hour session.<br/><br/>I decided that the farm has a regular routine for residents. As the game went on, it became more and more obvious that the routine was designed to keep the residents exhausted, separated, and healthy / delicious. I figured that residents would be completely left alone unless they broke the routine, and that any break in the routine would require a skill roll.<br/><br/>This is the schedule I wrote up on our whiteboard:<br/><br/>0730 - Wake.<br/>0800 - Morning feed.<br/>0825 - Wash.<br/>0900 - Exercise.<br/>1100 - Free time.<br/>1200 - Midday feed.<br/>1230 - Exercise.<br/>1500 - Sleep (short).<br/>1545 - Exercise.<br/>1700 - Free time.<br/>1800 - Evening feed.<br/>1830 - Wash.<br/>1900 - Bed time.<br/>1930 - Lights out.<br/><br/>We only played through one day from each week.<br/><br/>In the interests of pacing, I declared that this day would represent THE big action that each character would try to take during the week.<br/><br/>Starting with morning feeding time, which was an opportunity for the characters to talk freely, we figured out whether there was going to be an election for leader of the group. We also went around the table declaring our goals for the day - things that would require a skill roll.<br/><br/>Next we figured out who was going to work alone (roll their dice separately), and who was going to align themselves with the leader (creating a group dice pool). Everyone rolled, then I went round the table rolling their opposition.<br/><br/>We focused on each character's "scene" one at a time, calculating net successes, and then narrating the outcome. One thing that emerged very quickly in the game was that it was useful to think of one success as equalling one fact or achievement. For instance, a resident who was scouting out an area of the island and who got two successes was allowed to add two details to the map of the island we were drawing on the whiteboard.<br/><br/>Then we cut to a few minutes before lights out, and another opportunity for characters to talk freely.<br/><br/>After that we all discussed what would happen for the rest of their week in broad details. I said that each player could achieve one extremely generalised thing that didn't require a skill roll. for example, make friends with someone, roam around a particular section of the island during free time, or size up another group.<br/><br/>Finally, I crossed a week off the board and we began the cycle again.<br/><br/>... oh, and I found it useful to have a map of the Farm. I started it by drawing a very vague isolated section of coastline and the buildings and their immediate area. We only added to the map as a result of specific players successes on skill rolls, or general unhampered activities during the week. As the game developed, it started to become very obvious that the island was being resupplied from its upper north-west corner. That's where our group's escape attempts began to focus ...<br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=237012" rel="nofollow">I also asked Jared how he'd run it as a one-shot. </a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297796/#Comment_297796" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T11:50:14+00:00" title="October 21, 2010 11:50AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2010 12:02PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and here's a couple of other things I figured out (from later in that thread) about Bangs, the importants of Strain checks, and keeping track of NPCs.<br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/>... this is a game of scarce resources. Every scrap of information or stolen goods that the residents manage to scrape together needs to be fought or contested for.<br/><br/>On the whiteboard, I started writing out a list of the things that they had managed to assemble. These were items, people, or information that I could not take away from them without a skill roll or major dramatic development. As an example of a "major dramatic development", the first time that the residents met one of the Headmasters (the people who run the Farm), it was an surprise inspection tour that ended up focusing on Antonia. This stemmed from one of the other residents (Mark 3-3) having informed the authorities about her successful attempts to gather material for an escape. I asked Antonia which of the three items she had contributed to the List she wanted to have been discovered, and we removed that after role-playing out the conversation between her and the Headmaster.<br/><br/>My philosophy as GM was to play as fairly as possible. I gave them time (in-character) to talk and act freely, I re-rolled dice when I hadn't specified what number I was looking for. I'm sure there are other examples I can't think of now -- when you are controlling the side of "the Farm", you have a huge number of resources at your disposal, including the ability to be arbitrarily mean. I felt there was no need to hammer that home 100% of the time.<br/><br/>That reminds me: I found that Minders were absolutely crap at spotting sneaky stuff that the residents were trying to get away with. They only have two dice to roll in Psyche, compared to most players' four dice.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when players were describing their characters trying to determine the weaknesses in the Farm's security, I had them rolling against an arbitrarily determined six or seven dice of Psyche, to represent the presumably awesome skills of the people who had designed the Farm.<br/><br/>One final note -- I found keeping track of NPCs to be extremely tough. Not only are there all the staff, there are also 216 residents whose numbers keep changing on a weekly basis. Not only do you have to keep reducing everyone's group numbers, you have to kill the members of group 1 and introduce new group sixes. Maybe it's the obsessive compulsive in me, but I really wanted to make the NPCs I was keeping track of, consistent. It's just the paperwork that defied me.<br/><br/><br/>***<br/><br/>One thing that struck me: at the beginning of the game, I gave a general description of what the PCs noticed about the other groups. Alex (I think) asked if there was any correlation between the group numbers and their attitudes. I said yes and described how groups four and three seemed to be bruised and injured, while groups two and one seemed to be quieter and more hunched over. As the game proceeded, I noticed <i>this initial description mapped onto the changing behaviour of 'our' residents almost perfectly</i>.<br/><br/>About halfway through, once I had started to get my head around the rules and how they worked, I started adding in Bangs (tough decisions for the characters to make) and consequences to their previous actions. These included Mark 3-3 (the above-mentioned mole), a resident from another group who was attracted to Alex's character, and a Minder who started to take a particular interest in bullying Aaron's character.<br/><br/>All of this helped flesh out the world of the farm. I believe they would have all emerged naturally if we had been playing it over six weeks rather than three hours. It's these sort of nuances that, for me, would have helped add to the psychological horror of the game. Due to time constraints, I wasn't happy with how little I dwelt on each one of them but I was happy that they hinted at the scope of activities that were possible (and not permitted) on the Farm.<br/><br/>Also about halfway through, I started adding Strain checks (which I had just noticed in the rules). These are like Stress cheeks in InSpectres - a way for the GM to keep reducing player effectiveness, increased tension, and force the players to make choices about where to allocate their resources (healing vs gathering stuff that will help them escape). Strain checks are made for physical exhaustion, torture, prolonged periods without food or sleep, etc. As weeks three and four passed by I decided that the staff would be forcing Jamas' character to exercise (as he had been deliberately trying to gain weight), there was the previously mentioned bullying, and I had the opportunity to torture Antonia's and Alex's characters when they beat the crap out of Mark 3-3.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed at around this point was that the game was not as grim as I thought it would be. A gallows humour started to emerge between all the players as they joked about being eaten, being forced to exercise, and (in one case) their own real-life weight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395529/#Comment_395529" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T00:39:57+00:00" title="October 31, 2012 12:39AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I SUMMON THIS THREAD FROM THE GRAVE, FOR THE HOURS OF HALLOWEEN HAVE ARRIVED IN NEW ZEALAND.<br/><br/>To recap: in The Farm, you play people who have been kidnapped and taken to a mysterious island where you are fed and treated well for six weeks and then humanely slaughtered and eaten.
