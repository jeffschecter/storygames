Then I stumbled across How We Came to Live Here. Has only played this? Are there AP's floating about? What are people's opinions on it? I've just read through it. My ladyfriend and I wander through Chaco all the time and I've thought it would be a neat game idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot related but:<br/>\nIs there anyone in NM who is a storygamer (we seem to be lacking in this area)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
