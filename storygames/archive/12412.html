Trying to make sure that the rules for masterminds in Four Colors al Fresco mesh with the source material, so I'm looking for opinions:<br/><br/>In comics--particularly Golden Age and Silver Age--and the old pulp serials, and even the derivative media (like much of the action-spy genre--i'm thinking particularly of James Bond movies), if you had to generalize, does the mastermind get defeated by working outside of, or within, their idiom? That is, can we generalize that the way to defeat the mastermind villain is more often to outdo them at their own schtick, or to come at them outta left field?<br/><br/>By "mastermind", I'm thinking specifically of those villains that tend to be behind the scenes, manipulating other villains or setting elaborate plans in motion, rather than directly confronting the heroes. (Obviously, especially in the supers genre, a direct confrontation is usually the climax, however.) So, The Leader, Magneto, Lex Luthor, perhaps Shiwan Khan, and all those shadowy figures at the heads of international terrorist organizations. It seems like avoiding their strength is the usual way it plays out--I think specifically of the Leader, where the Hulk didn't outsmart him, he simply was tougher than expected. Or the Leader would be somehow hoisted on his own petard, usually as a result of underestimating the Hulk. Though, from another point of view, that also means that it was intelligence/knowledge that defeated him--specifically, his lack of the same. Had he been smarter or better-prepared, his smarts and prepration would've paid off. Which is why attempting to boil this down to a stereotype has eluded me, thus far.<br/><br/>So, any thoughts/opinions?

After all, if the villains' plan was flawed in some way, then the hero really wasn't much of a dramatic actor.  All they did was push over something already half busted. I can accept that in comics (for example) because watching the villain go about their business is as fun as watching the heroes. In games where you play the heroes, it's been unsatisfying when I've tried it.<br/><br/>One thing I've tried to emphasize to get around it is that the villains' plan WILL WORK, that is, absent heroic action, the villain will do their dirty deed,  but there will be big collateral consequences that the villain doesn't care about but the hero does. In other words, Chairface Chippendale writing his name on the moon is ALSO likely to boil the oceans, or kill the moon men, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278900/#Comment_278900" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T00:21:11+00:00" title="July  1, 2010 12:21AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that strikes me is that the villain often appears to be succeeding all the way, moving ever on to great heights of vicgtory, and it's just when they're about to finally win that it comes crashing down.<br/><br/>It can come crashing down from A) their own hubris/fatal flaw, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> the Hero working an angle all along, which only becomes apparent at the end, or C) the hero really being on the ropes but rallying at the zero hour for a desperate victory.<br/><br/>With the hubris/flaw example, I think often it can be something the villain cares about even more than achieving their master plan--capturing/killing/punishing the hero, protecting something or someone precious, or proving their superiority in some way.<br/><br/>WIth the Hero working an angle, it's tricky because all these subtle seeds need to be planted throughout the story, leading to an "aha! that was Batman in disguise all along!" kind of moment at the end. Hard to play out I imagine, unless you do, you know, play it out, and then it doesn't become a last-minute reveal, does it?<br/><br/>The last-minute desperate victory is probably easiest to work with in a roleplaying game, though reliably getting there AND having it turn out right could be tricky. I don't know what kind of rules structure you're going for so I won't volunteer any solutions. I will say that the MANER in which the hero rallies is highly individual--Spider-man would summon his inner chutzpah and sense of responsibility to push through the pain, while the Hulk would just blunder through on sheer stubborn cussedness and rage.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278901/#Comment_278901" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T02:38:48+00:00" title="July  1, 2010  2:38AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After hubris, the second most-common thing that brings down evil masterminds is treachery.  Usually their plans rely upon the abilities of other villains, henchmen, etc...but then the "no honor among thieves" clause kicks in towards the end and one of them tries to grab everything.  (Frequently because they assume -- correctly, in most cases -- that the mastermind is in fact planning to do the exact same thing to them.)  If the story in question is one about how heroes win the day through teamwork and trust and friendship, the appeal of this route is obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278916/#Comment_278916" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T07:02:37+00:00" title="July  1, 2010  7:02AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of what makes a mastermind story interesting from a RPG perspective is that it is really an active mystery - it is a quest for answers where the source of the mystery fights back by sending minions or henchmen to stall the protagonists or mislead them, by re-routing around damage caused by protagonists, or even by escalating due to the actions of the protagonists. But the danger of looking at a mastermind story after the fact is forgetting how essential the process of the revelation actually is. <br/><br/>When a protagonist (or group of protagonists) goes through a heroic campaign (in this case literally a series of battles or conflicts) with a lordly villain, they typically will defeat the lieutenants gaining power, prestige, or friends along the way - halting the villain's plans at each step. Eventually the thorn of the protagonists demands personal attention from the villain him or herself. <br/><br/>With a mastermind villain there is an alteration of this trend, rather than halting the plans, the protagonists reveal those plans at each step, discovering what they had been concerned with was an inconsequential part of a much bigger picture. <br/><br/>Once you get to a final confrontation though, it seems that a villain is a villain. There are tales about clever heroes outsmarting the villain, and clever villains outsmarting themselves. True, masterminds tend to be the smarter kind of villain, but the idea of what their true weakness will be isn't something you can determine without considering what the protagonists are. Underestimation is a good one, simply because with the pride and complexity of the mastermind's plans we expect the mastermind to slip up somewhere.<br/><br/>This of course assumes that the mastermind is actually the penultimate villain, or that the protagonists will actually fight the mastermind at all. Sometimes a villain gets what he wants, and then realizes it isn't at all when he envisioned, and begs the protagonists to stop the "out of control" plan. This could also be a betrayal by someone in the organization who has even more nefarious plans. In either case this isn't actually defeating the mastermind, it is the next step of the reveal. The mastermind has become the out of control doomsday machine or the insane lieutenant who just gave herself the powers of the god of death. Clearly those confrontations will have very different tropes.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278920/#Comment_278920" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T07:52:34+00:00" title="July  1, 2010  7:52AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion reminds me of My Life With Master, specifically the bit about hubris and treachery.

And it basically is just a refinement of the Descriptor (can't use "trait", because i'm using that term as a specific category, so "descriptor" becomes the superset of things about a character) system that already makes up the bulk of character description. And I really want what sets "masterminds" apart from other super-powered folks to be something inherent to them, not just the circumstances, so some sort of special category of Descriptor is perfect.

I'm avoiding spoilers here, so I can't get as specific as I'd like, but I'd that a personal blindspot on the part of the villain is every bit as significant as the power of the hero, in the downfall of his plans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279502/#Comment_279502" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-06T19:12:26+00:00" title="July  6, 2010  7:12PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>You know, I was thinking about the hubris-filled-mastermind problem on the way to work, and I realized that maybe one way to improve player agency in taking down a mastermind is in player authorship. If (for example) in FATE, you can, with some effort, preparation, skill, etc. declare that the villain's master plan "Relies On Flawed Diamonds", then that means that even if the character isn't the sole or even primary author of the villain's downfall, the player still is.</blockquote>\nOh, I wanted to say that Four Colors al Fresco <i>absolutely</i> has strong player authorship, both in deliberately-wiggly character abilities, and by using Storypath cards rather than more-conventional hero points [which is not to say that hero points can't provide player authorship--many games allow at least one of their uses to be some variation on "declare a fact"--but rather that by using the Storypath cards, that's the *only* thing they can accomplish--they don't do any of those other, more-mechanical, things that hero points often do in other games, like give bonuses or rerolls.]. So, yeah, declaring that the plan won't succeed due to some previously-unknown circumstances is always a viable option. I'm wondering how, outside of player authorship, masterminds get defeated--if there's a general trend/technique. Unfortunately for my initial mechanical ideas, I think y'all are right, that if there is a generalization to be made, it's that it has less to do with the heroes' capabilities than with the villain screwing up. Even if only the hubris of underestimating the heroes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279541/#Comment_279541" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-07T06:17:53+00:00" title="July  7, 2010  6:17AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I'm going to get slightly polemical (because this is sort of one of my Things) then back it up with examples:<br/><br/>The Mastermind's plan is his or her statement about reality:  Specifically 'The world is the kind of place that this will WORK, and moreover that you would agree that it is right and proper for it to work, if you only understood the world.'  The mastermind generally thinks that the world sucks in some important way, and it's vitally important to him that you think so too.<br/><br/>The hero's very existence is a rival statement about reality:  Specifically 'The world is the kind of place where people like me will rise to stop such villainy.'  The hero sees virtue in the world ... and that is why the villain cannot abide him.  Because if the hero is right then the villain is ... well ... a VILLAIN, as opposed to a reasonable person dealing with a corrupt world.<br/><br/>So the villains plan fails when (and because) their moral principles and assertions are discredited.  You know how their plan will fail when you know what they monologue about.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE:  Green Goblin paralyzes Spiderman and chats with him on the roof.  'The weak exist only so that the strong can dominate them,' he insists.  'Why be a hero to these people?  They'll only turn on you in the end.'  When a representative sample of the common people of New York band together to dramatically support Spiderman, show their gratitude, and frustrate the Goblin's strength, the Goblin's plans unravel.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE:  Any of a zilllllion evil bad totalitarian bad-guys talk about how humanity wants to be pushed around ... just look at this pathetic minion whom they boss around!  If people had a lick of sense, this guy would betray him, but he CAN'T, and that's why the villain's plan is right and inevitable.  MUAHAHA!  Of course, the villain's plan unravels when the lickspittle, inspired by the defiance and virtue of our heroes, finds the courage to resist his master.<br/><br/>By their evil monologues will you know them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280234/#Comment_280234" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T19:44:59+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  7:44PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, that is radness wrapped in rad sauce. Of course, I WOULD think that, being a slobbering-crazy Capes fanboy. but still!<br/><br/>I think this gets at why the question has been a bit difficult to answer up till now: because the mastermind's defeat is all wrapped up in refuting his statement about reality, the nature of that defeat is specific to the specific statement and and what it takes to refute it.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
