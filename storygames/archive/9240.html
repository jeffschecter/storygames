The goal is that I will be creating adventures with loosely pre-generated characters that breaks all the basics from the core book down into a nice little neat package. The goal will be to donate these pdf files free with event planning contests so that schools, and libraries can either have after school gaming programs run by staff or gamers donating time. <br/>\n It is highly important that the pdfs are all that is needed because the goal is to create an almost zero cost option for the schools and libraries or volunteers. For the most part the token system I will be using will be sufficient for almost everything but there will be certain situations that arise which will lend better to random results. The rare ability that requires for example your grenade scatters randomly should have a system. What I need is a math formula where two people will pick preset numbers secretly give them to the gm who then plugs them into the formula to generate a result from 1-100. I will have a little chart that can be printed with the formula on it and the plug ins so it should be quick.<br/>\n Again while I understand that dice would be a way better solution I need the game to require no monetary investment. <br/>\nThanks for any help you can offer.<br/>\nRegards, Seth Drebitko                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204402/#Comment_204402" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T07:56:21+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:56AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we call A the value chosen by first player and B the value for the second, I guess the simplest way to implement that would be :<br/>(A + <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> modulo 100<br/><br/>It's so simple I wonder if there is a parameter of your randomizer that I missed                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204410/#Comment_204410" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T08:15:26+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  8:15AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Seth,<br/><br/>I'm not a math guy. Probably some math guy will chime in shortly and give you what you want. (If not, ask at The Forge.)<br/><br/>But if I were pursuing your project, here's how I'd be thinking about solving this aspect of it.<br/><br/>I'd be thinking what I want is a big chart. One player picks a number, which maps to a column of the chart. And the other player picks a number which maps to a row of the chart. The cell at the intersection of that row and column has a number in it, which is the random result. If the result numbers are distributed properly, it's not possible for a player to game the chart for a specific result.<br/><br/>Results from 1-100 would require a non printably huge chart. But if you wanted to create a chart to generate results between 1 and 9, the simple non mathy way would be to create a grid of multiple solved Sudoku puzzles.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204418/#Comment_204418" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T08:31:04+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  8:31AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Franck,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>(A + <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> modulo 100</blockquote>\nThat seems gameable.

It's simple, and if at least one person is picking "randomly", it's more or less impossible to game. Regardless of what one person picks, every number result is equally likely to come up.<br/><br/>Here's an example. Say you're looking for numbers from 1 to 6 instead of 1 to 100. Alice picks "1", wanting a low number. If Bob picks 1 too, the result is 2. If Bob picks 2, the result is 3. If Bob picks 3, the result if 4. If Bob picks 4, the result if 5. If Bob picks 5, the result is 6. If Bob picks 6, the result is 1.<br/><br/>So despite Alice's "low" choice, every possible result from 1 to 6 is still not only there, but, if Bob is picking randomly, is also equally likely.<br/><br/>Plus "Each player picks a number from 1 to 100. Add them together, and then if the result is greater than 100, subtract 100 from it" doesn't require <i>any</i> chart whatsoever, which is, I think, a pretty big plus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204448/#Comment_204448" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T09:48:42+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  9:48AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>Yeah, but if B does that too much, then player A picks a number like 90, and ends up with 91.

And then the tokens they bid goes to the other player? something like that might liven the economy and produce interesting results.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you really want to use math and are more interested in a scatter diagram than anything, Have one player pick a number from 1-6 and the other pick a number from 1-6. If they add up to an odd number add 0 to the first players number. Otherwise add 6. The, scatter from the target with 12 being straight forward for that character and following clockwise.<br/>\n  You could change the numbers around if you need a different scale.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204552/#Comment_204552" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T15:58:19+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  3:58PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Modulo is correct.

I have something along the lines of the bidding for random results (kinda the theme of the game "God doesn't roll dice why should you") which will be a more advanced version of the game. I have three "stages" of complexity in place in place that I want to guage towards different age groups based on the micro game that they will be geared to.<br/>\nThe way I envision it is:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elementary school version will have no attributes and only very, very loose skills. When they decide what they want their characters to do a flash card with a problem (spelling, math, ect ect) will be given to the player to solve for each rank in their skill they get another guess if they were wrong. If the player gets the problem right they pass, wrong they fail. The game is designed to be crazy kinds of easy, to enforce school stuffs and enforce creative decisions. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe middle school version will introduce attributes, with skills, the token betting system and the formula will take some of the competitive weight off as the children get the hang of gaming, and get to focus on social development. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe high school version will be the full thing, token betting system, bidding for narrative control, and the introduction of more complex things like knacks and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal would be to create free adventures that include the rules and packets on how to run for example an after school program. The goal is one to grow kids up with gaming that grows at their age level, and of course advert my own products. <br/>\n<br/>\n So with that said I don\u2019t personally need anything else from this thread I very much like the modulo method, if anyone else wants to delve more into math formulas for resolution be my guest to hijack the thread. Last question being any one interested in going into the best ways one might go about appealing to schools and libraries about setting up after school programs in another thread?<br/>\nRegards, Seth Drebitko                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204602/#Comment_204602" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T21:49:05+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  9:49PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll just chime in to say that while the modulo method will work, it only works if both people are choosing randomly, and doing a good job at choosing randomly.

"Uniformly random" is considerably less stringent for an RPG than crypto.<br/><br/>A hash would allow a mapping from some smaller domain of provided values to a larger range of results, but you're still likely to see the same values come up over and over again. Essentially you're just telling the players "think of a number between 1 and 100, but wait, if you think of 4, say 92 instead (and vice versa)." If the rules system works on some kind of target number (seems likely) this doesn't change much, if the target number is also chosen relative to the output values we're going to see the same number of successes and failures.<br/><br/>If the assumption is that humans, even when instructed to do so, are not good at generating uniform distributions then the problem is a bit harder, and requires more math to solve than you'd likely want at the table.<br/><br/>Does the preference for smaller values hold no matter the domain? If humans can actually choose uniformly from, say, 1 to 10, then that could be easily mapped to 1-100 (or 1-10 might be a big enough range, I don't know too many games that make a huge distinction between a 52 and a 57 on a 1-100 scale).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206389/#Comment_206389" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T15:42:09+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  3:42PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In practice, people's picks really aren't random.

The assumption is, and it must be, that humans are poor at generating uniform distributions, because we are so astonishingly good at patterns.  But if you are willing to do (e.g.) the lookup on the magic square table, we can make that largely irrelevant, and better, we can incentivize attempts at real randomness because if your opponent sees you using a pattern, and he's right, he can harvest that non-randomness.<br/><br/>While it's true that a hash method doesn't increase the number of the results, it does spread them out better.  Consider: if I'm much more likely to pick a number in [1,100] that's less than 20 than one that's greater, and so are you, the sum of our results is likely to cluster in the [2, 40] range.  But any reasonable hash of our results will instead give a result of 40ish modal values evenly distributed in [1,100] instead.  The end result is thus more dicelike.<br/><br/>The concern about handling time is relevant.  But, you can make a linear feedback shifter that's easy enough to compute on paper, as long as you're not put off by short periodicity.  That's why I asked how many numbers might be required in a session.<br/><br/>Oh, and John: rock-paper-scissors <i>is</i> un-gameable precisely insofar as the players are capable of making random picks.

Even if the players are fully gaming the system, just have the GM assign success and failure arbitrarily to even and odd, then use whatever generation method. <br/><br/>I guess this kind of gets at the role of randomness in games. How random does your random generator really have to be?<br/><br/>For me at least, most of the fun isn't in success or failure per se, but in the unexpected. Great successes and crushing failaures can both be great fun so long as I don't see them coming. In fact, sometimes the fun comes from not seeing them coming (the natural 20 that turns the tide or whatever). So long as the random generator keeps me from seeing what's coming and keeps the decision out of any one person's hands, I'm cool with it.<br/><br/>The fact that I don't want the decision in any one person's hands is odd, and probably means I'm some kind of freak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206420/#Comment_206420" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T19:45:43+00:00" title="May  8, 2009  7:45PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Oh, and John: rock-paper-scissors<i>is</i>un-gameable precisely insofar as the players are capable of making random picks.

Skilled players do not choose randomly.  They often make a pattern clear, trying to catch other players into assuming it and then they break it to win.  <br/><br/>For example, suppose at first I try to ignore my opponent and play randomly.  My opponent, however, is carefully reading my expressions.  She plays "rock" over and over.  After a few clashes, convinced that she is going to do it again, I try to capitalize on this.  However, she reads me correctly when I do this and switches to scissors.  This is a common approach for how rock-paper-scissors is played in non-RPG contexts.  <br/><br/>Trying to play purely randomly seems like a limited defensive strategy.  You're trying to rely on the opponent not being able to read what you are going to do -- but in reality, you will have some tells in your expression, body language, etc.  If you succeed in being completely unreadable, the best you can hope for is a one-third chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206438/#Comment_206438" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-08T22:32:29+00:00" title="May  8, 2009 10:32PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>You do understand that doesn't work, right, because this is a<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VizziniGambit" rel="nofollow">Vizzini gambit</a>?

For example, people think they have to keep the distribution of numbers uniform so they may think "oh, I haven't picked 7 in a while, so I should pick 7 now" when that is really wrong thinking because for the new number to be fully random is cannot depend on previous numbers.  This produces correlation or patterns in the numbers given by a person.  If his opponent can figure out part of this pattern then he can do better than selecting true random numbers, by playing to beat the pattern.<br/><br/>jhkim is talking about another problem is that one player may be able to successfully 'read' the the other, gaining information from body language about what the number is.  Again, this changes the assumption above that we don't know anything about what the other player is doing, motivating us to not play randomly ourselves (even if we could).
