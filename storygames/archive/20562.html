It's mainly for myself to refer to, later.\n<blockquote><br/><br/>1. The *World game basic procedure of play is a semi-structured conversation: we take turns talking (but not precisely so - there is no set order or tracking of how many times a given player may speak).<br/><br/>2. Players, when it's their turn, can either (or both) a) ask the MC questions about what their characters know or what they can sense, or b) say what their characters do, think, or feel.<br/><br/>3. When it's the MC's turn to talk, she makes a move (typically a soft move, to set up a harder move). [Using some variation of the AW list of moves, which is fairly universal.] <br/><br/><i>[Note: I'd consider the "workspace" move fundamental here, as well. Some variation on, "name the requirements, and ask if they wish to try another way", should cover it.]<br/></i><br/>4. The MC's choice of moves is guided by her Agenda, Always Say, and Principles. (Roughly, "Why", "How", and more specific constraints.)<br/><br/>5. Most play is mechanically "freeform" (within the constraints of the above four points). For exceptions, see below (6 through 10):<br/><br/>6. There are subsystems also called "moves", which are triggered in specific fictional situations. Some of these "moves" have an immediate and specific effect, described in their text. Most others involve dice, as described below (7 through 10):<br/><br/>7. Diced moves are for players only, not the MC. These moves involve rolling 2d6 and adding a stat (stats range from -2 to +3).<br/><br/>8. Outcomes are classified in three categories, 10+, 7-9, or a miss. <br/><br/>9. On a 10+ or 7-9, the player and/or character generally retain agency, often picking from lists. 7-9 is usually an unpleasant choice which brings complications into the situation; 10+ is usually unambiguously good. (Generally, the roll either accomplishes or does a good deal to advance the PC's agenda, in either case.)<br/><br/>10. On a miss, the MC makes an appropriate hard move, either based on the fictional situation or encoded in the move's description. (In comparison to the 7-9 and 10+ results, it's usually the case that the PC's immediate fate is no longer in the player's hands, until the MC has played their move and it's their turn to talk again.)<br/><br/>X. "Case-by-case" modifiers to the 2d6 roll are generally not used; it's considered more appropriate to adjust the stakes - risk harsher consequence on a miss (for increased threat/difficulty) or sweeter success (for decreased risk/difficulty) - instead.<br/><br/><i>I've marked the last one "X", because it's not really fundamental to any given *World game's design. However, it's a pretty strong part of the *World ethos, and true in the vast majority or *World games. For many people, it's a defining feature of *World games.</i><br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451734/#Comment_451734" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-03T01:53:32+00:00" title="March  3, 2016  1:53AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say your 7 and 8 are not important to me, and 9 only partly.<br/><br/>It's true that many, probably most, PbtA games keep these conventions, but they are by no means necessary. E.g.

It shows up in play, sure, but a lot of people don't necessarily follow that to the letter - I've seen plenty of "bad" interpretations of PbtA rules and actual plays because they forget the intent of that MC move rule.

As I wrote the Playbooks, the shape they took told me what the basic moves had to be, e.g. if The Hushed was very good at going unnoticed, then there should be a basic move that enables that, so <b>avoid conflict</b> was born.<br/><br/>As I created more Playbooks and moves, it became clearer to me what the game would be about, but at this point I still haven't written down my Agenda &amp; Principles: they're there in the design fog, somewhere, but I haven't distilled them into actual written words yet.<br/><br/>It's good to have a procedure, but sometimes you just have to write what's in your head, throw it into some kind of shape and hope that the pieces can be made to fit together without having to backtrack too much or even start over at the beginning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451767/#Comment_451767" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-04T21:09:38+00:00" title="March  4, 2016  9:09PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true!

(Consider that even AW has moves which are rolled several times in repetition, for instance.)<br/><br/>For example, the structure of "on a miss, the MC makes a move" is the very thing which *enables* a fictional snowball. <br/><br/>That's quite different from a game which has a rule which says, "you can only roll once". (And, I think, much stronger.)<br/><br/>I'll leave it off the list for now.<br/></blockquote>\nI think you could still argue for snowballing as part of the skeleton, mostly as such:<br/><br/>It's not just that the MC is told to make a move on a miss, but that the MC is told to make a move which escalates the situation and keeps the story going. That's the common factor behind the lists of MC moves in the best PbtA games. If you stop at "the MC makes a move on a miss", that move could be anything, including non-snowbally stuff like "you don't unlock the door; would you like to try again?". I would say that every PbtA game needs to use MC moves which change and evolve the situation, so that on a miss, things snowball.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452041/#Comment_452041" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-05T19:04:47+00:00" title="April  5, 2016  7:04PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear what you're saying, but (for example) Apocalypse World has lots of moves which don't "snowball" on a miss.

Near the other end of the line are the *W settings. Most of the *W setting doesn\u2019t exist before the game and much of the \u201cbuilding out\u201d of the setting is done by the players.  The coherence of the setting (how it all fits together well) is assisted be strong genre expectations (everyone at the table has a good idea what could happen in the setting) and by what is written in the handouts (playbooks, common moves, etc.).<br/><br/>Monsterhearts\u2019 genre is \u201cyoung adult urban fantasy\u201d such as \u201cBuffy\u201d, \u201cTwilight\u201d, or \u201cThe Vampire Diaries\u201d. Dungeon Worlds genre is what I would call \u201cD&amp;D Fantasy\u201d. Although this genre is not as well known in popular culture, it is very familiar to the RPG set. AW\u2019s \u201cpost apocalypse wasteland\u201d is a little more open genre, but the handouts and the emphasis on scarcity help with the coherence.<br/><br/>I am unsure if the settings of other *W games are of the same type, so I don\u2019t know if this idea is part of the skeleton.<br/><br/>---Shawn---                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452085/#Comment_452085" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-08T20:11:40+00:00" title="April  8, 2016  8:11PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>,<br/><br/>I really enjoyed those articles - excellent stuff - but I'm not sure what you're getting at.

In my experience, that usually means that the roll starts to feel like it didn't matter, and the fiction loses momentum.<br/><br/>I can imagine some *rare* situations where those things could happen, but I think that, as a general rule, following these guidelines is pretty solid. <br/><br/>If you have an alternative "skeleton" formulation in mind, feel free to go ahead! <br/><br/>I've added the word "case-by-case" to line X.
