So far we've only managed to do character creation, but are hoping  to start the campaign this weekend. I thought I would post character stats and descriptions to give you a sense of what The Magical Land of Yeld is all about. Several of the players compared character creation to "Best Friends," where characters stats are based on how much everyone else at the table hates you. <br/><br/>With Yeld, all of the players take on the rolls of children between the ages of 5-12. You roll two 6-sided dice to determine your starting age, create a name, decide if you are a boy or girl, and then everyone else at the table decides what kind of Friend you are. These can range from Big Brother to Brat to Know-it-All to Princess (which can be a boy). Some have restrictions based on age or whether you are a boy or girl. All of them come with Special Dice, which are extra abilities, and bonuses to your Core Dice, your basic stats.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Violet<br/>7-year-old girl<br/>Type of Friend: Brat<br/><br/>Core Dice<br/>Strong: 1<br/>Smart: 1<br/>Tough: 3<br/>Brave: 1<br/><br/>Special Dice<br/>Break: 2<br/>Fight Dirty: 1<br/><br/><br/>Davey<br/>9-year-old boy<br/>Type of Friend: Princess<br/><br/>Core Dice<br/>Strong: 1<br/>Smart: 3<br/>Tough: 1<br/>Brave: 1<br/><br/>Special Dice<br/>First Aid: 1<br/>Sew: 1<br/>Girl Stuff: 1<br/><br/><br/>Mac McCreedy<br/>10-year-old boy<br/>Type of Friend: Bully<br/><br/>Core Dice<br/>Strong: 3<br/>Smart: 1<br/>Tough: 1<br/>Brave: 1<br/><br/>Special Dice<br/>Trip: 1<br/>Bullseye: 2<br/><br/><br/>Chase<br/>8-year-old boy<br/>Type of Friend: Liar<br/><br/>Core Dice<br/>Strong: 1<br/>Smart: 2<br/>Tough: 1<br/>Brave: 2<br/><br/>Special Dice<br/>Liar: 2<br/>Letter Writing: 1<br/><br/><br/>In the Yeld campaign you don't get a Heroic Job until a couple of sessions in. However, we all looked through the various jobs to get an idea of what we thought we might want to pursue with our characters. Several of the jobs lent themselves really well to our characters and concepts.<br/><br/>For Violet, the Soul Thief seems like a good choice, mostly because the player loves thieves and darker characters, and the Soul Thief strikes a lot of chords with her. A bratty Soul Thief capable of destroying your armor and wearing down your strength strikes me as a terrible foe indeed.<br/><br/>For Davey, the Shepard is a likely job, because it is a solid class that provides a lot of support to other characters, such as providing first aid and repairing armor (sew).<br/><br/>For Mac, the Oath Breaker is a natural fit, because it prizes strength and is a defiant role, perfect for the group's headstrong Bully. Plus it gives him lots of reasons to hit things.<br/><br/>For Chase, my character, I think I will go with the Freelancer, a nice cross between a jack-of-all trades and a scout. <br/><br/>These are just a couple of the possible jobs, and things might change by the time we get there, but these were the ones that jumped out at us. <br/><br/>We've got a couple other players who plan to catch games when they can, and there are eight basic Friends types, so we already have been talking about possibilities for their characters. i really want to have one of the characters be 12 so we can deal with the storyline of one of the kids turning 13 while in Yeld (which has dangerous ramifications for the rest of the group and is a very cool story device, in my opinion).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It seems like for the first few sessions, I will be the game master. One of the ideas of the game is to rotate who is GM to give everyone the chance to come up with a session idea and influence the course of the story, but my players really want to be players at this point. Once they are more familiar with the rules and gameplay, I'm sure they are going to want to step up and take the GM's hat for a session or two, but until then I will fill the role and keep Chase mostly in the background.<br/><br/>I think I've come up with the first adventure, or at least the story hook/title: "Goblins in the Stacks." It will be set in a comic book shop in the Mall of America.<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142946/#Comment_142946" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T13:50:40+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  1:50PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just responded to this on your LJ.

I've never seen that happen (because people freak out and assume you need one), but the game is totally made to function without one. It's just a little harder. Especially seeing as how most of you only have one Tough die. I'd recommend Shields and a lot of Jerky! I'm thinking about revising the armor rules to reduce the Tough requirement by one level. I'll be interested in seeing what you guys think.<br/><br/>One of the ways to avoid the early party wipe with non heroic Friends who have only 1 Tough die is to have a lot of non-lethal adventure. Adventures where the point isn't so much a fight, but other things. Finding a lost pet, exploring some ruins, digging up a treasure, learning to sword fight. These are fun things that totally won't be sending you to the ghost world every time you fail! I'm working on expanding the text to make they way you go about these adventures more evident.<br/><br/>I hear what you are saying about the players wanting to be players. But don't let them get away with it for too long! Do a few games as GM, then say "okay, so who's turn is it next week". Don't let them argue. By that time at least one of them should have some cool ideas for a game. And once they try it, they'll probably like it enough to want to do it again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143009/#Comment_143009" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T04:09:41+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  4:09AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jake,<br/><br/>Is this game open to other players/readers?

Should we reallocate dice before we start to  move some of those 3 stats down to 2 and bump each character's Tough up?<br/><br/>Also, the first session takes place a good deal in the "real world" before the Friends go through the door. If they are reduced to 0 Tough, I assume they are knocked out?

We added two more players, Cody and Kim, who played Zappa the Baby (5 yo boy) and Rainbow the Know-It-All (8 yo girl). I will post stats on these two characters later, as well as the revised stats for the existing characters. We made sure all of the characters now have a Tough of at least 2, and changed Davey (our resident Princess) Special Die: Girl Knowledge to Monster Knowledge, figuring he was a big comic book/sci-fi/fantasy fan and would have a better chance than most of knowing secrets of some of the monsters we would encounter.<br/><br/>The setup for "Goblins in the Stacks," our first adventure, was rather simple. The player characters were all Friends who were going to the Mall of America to a comic book shop to purchase Issue 1 of a Japanese Manga called "The Magical Land of Yeld." All of them had heard the comic was incredible, but no one knew any more about the book. So the session began with the kids standing in a long line waiting for the store to open and worried that by the time they would make it inside, all of the issues would be sold.<br/><br/>I made a mistake early on by deciding the proprietor of the comic book shop was a former-hippie-artist-turned-comic-book-guy named Dirty Gary (I know a comic shop owner named Gary who is a great guy, so I took the name from him, but added the "Dirty" part to give the character more personality). This proved to be waaayyy too open to interpretation, and the players had a lot of fun with the name. Too much fun. <br/><br/>Anyway, the players all had different ideas on how to up their chances of getting inside the comic book shop, and most of them involved some sort of action that would either get all of them thrown out of the mall or cause harm to the people in the line. At one point Cody (playing the Baby) said "Fire makes for a good distraction." With my character Chase, I tried to steer them in a less destructive path, and as GM reminded everyone they were kids and relatively good ones. <br/><br/>In the end the group decided to get out of line and work their way around to the back of the mall and to the back door of the comic book shop. It was a known fact Dirty Gary had a storeroom in back called The Stacks, an area reserved for back stock, rare comics and piles of memorabilia collected by Gary over the years (including a monster-mask collection that would come into play later in the game).<br/><br/>As GM I spent the first of my Action Dice to set up a challenge for the players: To sneak into the back storeroom without being noticed. The two smartest characters, Rainbow and Davey, put their heads together, so I allowed Davey to make a Smarts roll of 3 (2 for his Smarts and an extra die since Violet was helping) against a relatively minor challenge of 2. I'm not sure this is how it was laid out in the rules, but in order to keep things moving I decided not to search through the rulebook and instead allowed the extra die. Davey made the roll fairly easilty, ending up with an 11 versus my 6, so I decided the back door hadn't shut properly after the last delivery and there wasn't anyone watching the back door. The kids slipped in and began to search for the comic books.<br/><br/>Throughout the session I allowed players to name small items their character might carry, so long as it seemed within reason (no shotguns or bolt cutters). Davey pulled a small Hello Kitty keychain light out of his fanny pack (he is the Princess after all) to give them some light, and they slowly worked their way through the stacks of old comic books. Eventually, in the middle of the room, they found a small thick cardboard box with Japanese writing on the lables. The top had been opened. A thick velvet curtain hung over the doorway to the front of the shop, and they could hear Dirty Gary arguing with someone on the phone about a shipment being delayed and receiving too few comics. Convinced he was talking about "The Magical Land of Yeld," Violet the Brat, played by Rachel, reached into the box and pulled out the top copy of MLY. It was a rare chromium cover and was thicker than the other comics in the box, with a note that it contained a limited edition full color map of Yeld. <br/><br/>more...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143789/#Comment_143789" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T16:14:02+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  4:14PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The group then argued over what to do with the rest of the comics, whether they would steal them, destroy them or somehow ruin them. I'm not sure why our Friends suddenly became such hooligans, but as the GM I told them they could hear noises and voices coming toward them from inside the stacks. The Friends split, with most of us diving behind some boxes and accidentally into a pile of Dirty Gary's monster masks. Violet and Mac, the 10-year-old Bully and oldest of the group, went behind a pile of Little Lulu back issues and watched as three Goblins came out from between several bookcases. One of the Goblins carried a twisted branch that glowed blue at the tip. They were talking about the Yeld comic book and searching for the box.<br/><br/>Mac decided to cause a distraction and tried to fire his slingshot (I decided a Bully could have one of those as a level 0 weapon) into the darkness, but ended up hitting Chug, the large, slow-witted Ogre following the Goblins. The shot did not damage, but there was a moment when the Friends thought they had been found. The Goblins called for Chug, and the leader, CrackTooth (a crooked-jawed Goblin) told the Ogre to "store" the case. Chug unhinged his lower jaw and swallowed the box. <br/><br/>Violet and Mac, with the Goblins and Ogre between them and their Friends, decided to cause a distraction, and together overturned the table they hid behind, sending Little Lulu comics scattering everywhere. They yelled "Door!" and ran, pursued by two of the three Goblins.<br/><br/>Carey, who plays Davey, came up with a cool idea: He grabbed a goblin-like mask, put it on, stood up and did a Smarts test against Chug. He yelled that "the little green kid" (CrackTooth) stole his wand. Chug, with a Smarts of 1, rolled a 4. Davey added in a Special Die of Monster Knowledge (that Ogre's are stupid) and rolled 3 dice, getting a 14 total. Chug turned, grabbed CrackTooth by the head, and as Davey and the other Friends ran, he made a Strong challenge against the Goblin (each rolling one die and winning with a 4 to CT's 1) and stole the wand.<br/><br/>Violet was pursued by the Goblin FinHead (who had a fin on his head) while Mac was pursued by OneEye (who had only,,, well, you get the idea). Violet grabbed a limited edition replica lightsabre, complete with sound and light up action, and spun to confront FinHead. She failed her Brave challenge and FinHead attacked, but failed in his attack (Strong 1) versus her defense (Tough 3). We decided the two of them squared off, and Violet attempted another Brave challenge, this time winning the die roll, knocking out FinHead's Brave of 1, and sending the Goblin running in terror.<br/><br/>OneEye lept up on a bookcase and Mac turned and used his Special Die of Trip to make a Strong attack of 3, knocking the book case over and crushing OneEye (Tough 1). The Goblin dropped a piece of Loot, and I ruled it was a Serrated Goblin Blade (Weapon 0). Mac grabbed up the sword and ran.<br/><br/>The Friends found themselves in the wrong part of The Stacks, unable to find the door out. Davey noticed the harder he gripped the wand, the more light it shed, so he suggested all of the Friends take ahold of it, and the blue light blazed forth, illuminating an old iron bound wooden door. Hearing Chug and CrackTooth coming toward them (CrackTooth having seeing the comic book in Violet's back pocket as she ran) the Friends opened the unknown door and lept through.<br/><br/>They all fell in a heap on the dirty ground outside, with sunlight streaming down on them. A booted foot landed beside them, and an armored guard in medieval gear told them to "get up, get moving." Other people in similar dress milled about, and the Friends realized they had fallen through the door, which hovered and rotated several feet above a large dry fountain. An old woman warned the group they had better move along, because the Whirr-Clicks that guarded the door certainly would come to see what had come through. No sooner did the Friends ask what a "Whirr-Click" was, then two large steam-driven robots came clunking around a corner. Everyone in the town square darted indoors, and the old woman beckoned the friends to hide in a small inn. <br/><br/>more ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143790/#Comment_143790" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T16:14:11+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  4:14PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was pretty much the end of the adventure. We talked a little bit about the direction of the next session, and everyone said they enjoyed the game and were eager to see where it led from here. One a side note, we did come to one decision concerning the theme of the game. We decided all future sessions would be based on the names of songs by the Canadian band Rush. So the next session will be appropriately named "La Villa Strangiato," the Strange Village.<br/><br/>I plan to post updated character stats and monster stats as well. I need to go back and figure out how many Adventure Dice I spent (four monsters and one challenge), but I am sure it was well less than 20, so it was an Easy Challenge (meaning the players now have 1 Reward Die).<br/><br/>Thats about it for now.

Well, here it is for anyone who is interested:<br/><br/>Hey, that sounds great. Good stuff! I have a few questions and comments.<br/><br/>In revising the Friends Core dice so that they all have 2 Tough dice, does it feel like they are now weak in other areas? My idea with the limited number of Core dice was that if you want to excel in one thing, it would be at the cost of everything else. You can be Tough, but the cost is that you suffer somewhere else. And there is no dump stat. I'm curious to see how everyone being tough will play out for you guys. It should work fine in that you'll all be able to stand up to damage, but I'm curious to see where your weakness will be.<br/><br/>A Japanese manga called "The Magical Land of Yeld"? Cute.<br/><br/>Your first conflict is pretty interesting for a few reasons. It sounds like what you did was present a problem, have the players roll, and then revealed to them how it was overcome. That totally works. I've been going about it a different way. Two different ways, actually. Usually what I do is I'll present a problem and let the players tell me how they want to deal with it, then have them roll to see if they succeed. For example:<br/><br/>Derek and Kim want to sneak into the back room of the store. Derek says he's going to pick the lock on the door, while Kim decides she'll sneak through the window. They roll their dice against my challenge dice. I decide that sneaking through the window is pretty hard. It's high off the ground. I roll 3 dice against Kim. I decide that I don't really want to waste more dice on this conflict, so I declare that the door isn't even locked! In fact, it's open. Derek can walk right in.<br/><br/>So that's one way I've been doing it. It seems to me like there was another way I've been handling this as well, but now I can't remember what it was now. Anyway, I'm not saying that the way you did it was wrong, just that it was different. It seems to work fine.<br/><br/>Something to consider is that the player gets to describe the results of his or her success or failure. Here's the bit from the rules:<br/><br/>"Who describes what happens? Any time your Friend does anything, you<br/>get to describe what happens. If you are describing the outcome of a roll your description must reflect the rolls success or failure. You can\u2019t fail a roll to jump over a hole and then describe how your Friend jumps over it anyway. Instead, you get to describe just exactly how your Friend almost makes it! While the other players get to describe what they do, the Game Master gets to describe what everything else does! The Game Master will describe the actions of the people the Friends meet, the Monsters that attack them and the strange things they see in the land of Yeld."<br/><br/>So if Rainbow and Davey are trying to sneak into the store and they roll a success, they get to describe how they get in. They may say something like "Oh look, the door was open", or they may describe how they dodge security guards by hiding in the trash cans, then slip in the back when Dirty Gary comes out for a smoke. It's up to them. You can totally exert control over this by framing the conflict a little more specifically. Instead of saying "the challenge is sneaking into the back room", you could say something like "the door has been left open. Can you sneak in without anyone seeing you". Either way is totally fine.<br/><br/>The one problem I have with this conflict is that it's not actually a conflict. The door is actually unlocked. The kids can walk right in. If the door was unlocked the entire time, then there wasn't a challenge. Unless the challenge was figuring out to come around to the back door, or working up the courage to see if the door was unlocked. That's viable. Challenges should be more concrete.The door is locked. There's a security camera. There's a Gap employee eating lunch. Something that actually keeps the Friends from accomplishing their goals. The friends shouldn't have to roll dice just to find out that there never was a challenge in their way.<br/><br/>That's what I think, anyway (more...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143819/#Comment_143819" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T19:52:49+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  7:52PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Teaming up to overcome challenges has come up a few times. There's actually no mechanic in the game for helping out a Friend. So technically, each Friend faces each challenge by themselves. What you did here seems to both make sense and work pretty well.Something like that will probably make it into the game text. I'd say that the most help a Friend could give would be a single die, and that no more then one Friend could help at a time.<br/><br/>Minor items like the Hello Kitty flashlight used to be part of the game. When you made your Friend you choose a few personal items as well. These were single use items that let you roll an extra die. They stopped working once the Door closed. Another idea was that real world items were really powerful, but only functioned in the real world. Yeld items worked great in Yeld, but not at all in the real world.I eventually got rid of the real world items because I didn't want a complicated item list that would be useless once the door closed. But I've always liked the idea of items from the real world. They may appear again in some way.<br/><br/>"Store the case". Awesome!<br/><br/>Davey tricking the Ogre was fantastic. I hope it's apparent that this kind of stuff is totally within the rules. I'm glad he was able to use "II Know About Monsters". I sometimes wonder why I left the "I know about..." Special dice in there, then something like this happens and I remember that they're not knowledge dice like in D&amp;D, but all purpose utility dice. That probably needs to be explained better in the text.<br/><br/>In Violets fight against Fin Head, what were the Brave Challenges for? Were these to see who got to fight first, or for something else? Oh, after reading it again, it looks like she was trying to interrupt him so she could attack first. Right?<br/><br/>In the Mac and One Eye fight, it sounds like Mac used Trip to knock the book case over and hurt One Eye. Really, how this should have worked is that Mac would just make a normal attack (Strong dice), describing it as a push against the book case, causing it to topple on One Eye. There's no reason to involve Trip. Except that I imagine that Mac wanted the extra die from Trip. The problem there is that while Trip does add to Strong dice, it doesn't take away Tough dice. One Eye would have lost Strong dice instead of Tough dice. This may have been exactly what happened, but I thought I'd point it out anyway. Actually, is it clear at all how Trip and similar Special dice work?<br/><br/>Using Rush songs as titles is awesome. Good call. It sounds like you guys had a great game. You've got me all excited to play again.

I read "Trip" and I think "knocking things down." I guess the way I was handling Special Dice more was "if you can explain why you should get the extra die, you do." I need to stick closer to your rules to test those out, I just find in the middle of a scene I am more willing to let a player have their way if it seems to fit the moment.<br/><br/>The Brave challenges against FinHead... thats a tricky one to explain. Part of Davey's "I know about Monsters" was "Ogres are slow-witted but strong and brave, and Goblins are smart but easily frightened." Violet was trying to scare FinHead (that was what the player wanted to do, something akin to Han Solo chasing the storm troopers ... probably because she had a lightsabre). The Brave challenge failed (I think it was a 1 vs. 1, cant remember right now) but then FinHead's attack failed, so the two just kind of stopped in front of one another. The player said "I try again" so I allowed a second Brave challenge, her swinging the flashing sword above her head like she was going to hit him, he failed the challenge this time, so i had him run away.<br/><br/>Oh, and the real-world items - the main reason I decided to allow them (and even encouraged them) to have those is because of the Trade Special Dice. I think it says something about trading items for things in Yeld? So, my plan was to give them a few things they could barter with once in Yeld. Kim, who was playing Rainbow, mentioned at some point having antacids (like her Friend had stomach problems so her mom had her carry them). I immediately came up ideas on how those could be used in-game, like encountering a Dragon with a tummy ache or to get Chug to give up the box of comic books, so I said "write that down!" So now her character sheets has "antacids" as a piece of equipment.<br/><br/>I will write more as I get time and answer some of your other questions. I'm cross-posting this to my LJ as well.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144074/#Comment_144074" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T19:07:10+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  7:07PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the Special dice have more general uses (like I Know About Monsters), while others are more specific. I can understand what you are saying. The die is called Trip, and the kid was trying to knock someone over. So it makes sense that  he should get the bonus die. On the other hand, Trip is meant to do something very specific (take away a Monsters Strong dice), and there are other Special dice, weapons and Items that add Strong dice for the purpose of removing Monsters Tough dice. So using the trip die to do other things makes it more useful and valuable then it should be. If the kid wants to be able to do that kind of thing he needs to invest in Special dice (or weapons or items) that allow him to do it. So is the problem that the dice is called "Trip"? If it was called "Cripple" or "Sap Strength", would it be easier? or is this a mechanical problem? Or is it that the player doesn't have a full understanding of how the system works, and wants to use the stuff on his sheet for something it doesn't quite do.<br/><br/>There's a way to get the same effect using the Trip die as written. The kid rolls to trip the goblin. the action is described as pushing over the bookcase, trying to knock the goblin off. the kid rolls his strong and adds his trip dice, beating the  goblins Tough roll. So that's a success. the mechanical effect is that the Goblin looses a Strong die. The kid gets to describe the result, and can say that the goblin is trapped under the bookshelf. When the goblins action comes around you have a few choices. You can have the Goblin jump out and do something. With reduced Strong dice the Goblin probably can't attack, so you may just want to have him run away. You could decide that the bookcase requires a Strong test to escape from. that probably traps the goblin, and takes him out of play. Either way the Goblin is pretty much defeated. The third option is that you can just declare that the Goblin is defeated. he can't get out of the bookcase, and even if he can, he doesn't have the Strong dice to attack. the results here are the same as what you guys ended up with, but no bending of the rules was required. So I guess the question is whether or not any of this was apparent.  Also, this all assumes that the goblin didn't have any other options for th e combat. If he had some Special dice he could use, or if he was actually strong enough to escape the book shelf and attack, then the fight really should continue. \n<blockquote>The Brave challenges against FinHead... thats a tricky one to explain. Part of Davey's "I know about Monsters" was "Ogres are slow-witted but strong and brave, and Goblins are smart but easily frightened." Violet was trying to scare FinHead (that was what the player wanted to do, something akin to Han Solo chasing the storm troopers ... probably because she had a lightsabre).</blockquote>\nThat makes sense. You can totally do that. I know this isn't really addressed well in the text, but if a player says they want to do something, you just need to decide what core dice it falls under and have them roll against Challenge dice or a Monster. So you were totally right. I just wasn't getting what you were saying. In an older version of the text there were specific rules for scaring Monsters and Friends. You rolled opposing Brave dice, and the loser ran away. It turned out this was super powerful, so I got rid of it. We replaced it with the Special die "Scare", which isn't nearly as devastating. But I think what you did was fine. If it worked for you guys, then I don't see a problem. I would just caution against that becoming a regular tactic.<br/><br/>Yeld has a pretty rigid fight system, which is meant to emulate stuff like Final Fantasy Tactics and Secret of Mana. As a result, it kind of limits some of the stuff players might want to do. At the same time, I think there's a lot of fun to be had in emulating that kind of combat (I mean, I really like it). So this might take some getting used to. of course, you're also free to tell me that it just isn't working for you guys, and that you think things need to be changed!<br/><br/>The antacid idea is awesome. I want to work real world items back into the game. The first game we played here in Portland, we all choose a single item from the real world. We had a pocket watch and abacus which were never used, and a princess dress, base ball and pocket knife which came up all the time. None of these items has stats or mechanical benefits, but they were really important to the game.<br/><br/>Anyway, good feedback.
