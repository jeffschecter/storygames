Advantage dice that stick around or pile up can get to be a drag, so why not entice people to use them up in a blaze of glory?<br/><br/>Instead of defining particular advantages as either lasting or perishable (which bumps my "too complex" bone), in each conflict players could decide if they want to burn any advantages they have in exchange for more dice in that conflict -- probably double the normal dice for the advantage or something like that.<br/><br/>Players would be required to narrate how the advantage was used up in the all-out attempt: they fire every bullet out of the pistol and then throw it at the mummy, hack the fire axe into the crab-monster's shell so hard it gets stuck and yanked out of their hands, or (for example) crash their snowcone cart into a rampaging zombie elephant (peace out Jackson!). Win or lose, that advantage is gone.<br/><br/>- Normally ramping up the number of dice could really break the system, but in GC once you hit a certain number of dice your odds aren't really getting much better. And one conflict can only hurt the menace a little bit no matter what.<br/><br/>- It could encourage players to cash in the big stationary advantages for huge dice, which is probably dramatically better -- you should only try to lure the monster into the electrified fence once (shorting it out in a big kablooie) not over and over again to whittle it down -- boring!<br/><br/>- Less annoying accumulated inventory and looting bodies, since anyone with 2 conditions is going to absolutely double-down and try to save their own lives. Never die with bullets!<br/><br/>- Could also lead to interesting selfish situations: if someone is at 2 conditions they might double-down on big advantages that the other characters would rather save for a better time. Nothing like blowing the electric fence to try to save yourself (doubling down on 3 dice and destroying it) when the menace isn't even at 8 dice yet and is immune...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176343/#Comment_176343" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T13:54:12+00:00" title="October 26, 2008  1:54PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A great idea - but there are some things that should be one-shot.<br/><br/>I really like the looks of Geiger Counter.

(i mean, after you did that)<br/><br/>heh, never die with bullets [remaining]. "never perish whilst retaining munitions"<br/><br/>John: Ben's idea doesn't change the one-shot-ness of GC. in fact, by burning out some of the advantage dice (stuff the protagonists use), it supports it. there is a different tracker for the antagonist (or whatever form the opposition takes), called Menace dice, which gradually grow from one to eight, and then are depleted again as the protagonists beat "it" in contests. (each roll beaten = -1 Menace die). those menace dice are only subtracted after their number has grown to eight, however- beating the menace in contests before that just means that your character isn't injured (which, you'll admit, is still valuable)<br/>You'll see that mucking with the advantage dice in any way won't affect the Menace dice.<br/>And what ben is suggesting, in my opinion, offers a great opportunity to push the game further into immediacy and past stagnation (in my experience, the plague of too-long running games.)<br/><br/>andrew: scribble it now! you never know when the zombies will succeed in getting through the barricades and ripping the flesh from your face. best to ensure good game ideas for those who find your collection of texts, those post-internet narrito-primitivists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176573/#Comment_176573" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T09:44:05+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  9:44AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dig this. Definitely has a lot of potential in late-game confrontations with the menace, especially of the "This ends here!" final fight variety.  Yeah, Ripley can pull out her constructobot suit, but then it falls out of the airlock.<br/><br/>My only worry would be it unbalancing the not-really-balanced resources between the menace and the PCs.  Like you say, if your character has 2 conditions, players are going to feel additional pressure to burn up their resources to save the characters' skins, whether it makes dramatic sense or no.  For groups that have firmly grasped "all competition in GC is fake," that might not be much of a problem.  But my sense is that most groups (who've only played the game, at most, once or twice) are only hanging on to that idea with one hand, trying not to let go. An additional incentive to strategize and try to survive at all costs might tip things in a non-optimal direction, even if, like you say, it wouldn't necessarily do much, mechanically.<br/><br/>So, yeah, definitely give it a whirl and let me know how it goes.  I'm thinking that the Gamma Edition might have a page or two in the back that's like "optional bonus rules that you should probably invoke a couple of times a game," including stuff like this and your "outrun the bear" sacrifice rule and ideas on how to destroy or transform parts of the map.  Honestly, I think that kind of thing should be more common in game design: rules that can be invoked somewhat arbitrarily in cool situations, but would harm the game if people used them all the time.  We should be able to trust players to not overdo it and ruin their own fun, yeah?  Just like learning to fight effectively in a combat system, there's something to be said for helping people learn how to approach pacing and scene framing through play and some general advice, not strict mechanical guidelines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176574/#Comment_176574" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T09:48:53+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  9:48AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thought: maybe we should call these things "Rules Gimmicks" like in Universalis, which emphasizes that 1) they break the normal rules, and 2) they are "gimmicks" and, as such, shouldn't be overused, but definitely add some spice and variety to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176635/#Comment_176635" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T17:53:23+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  5:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2008 6:03PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>An additional incentive to strategize and try to survive at all costs might tip things in a non-optimal direction, even if, like you say, it wouldn't necessarily do much, mechanically.</blockquote>\nI agree, that's a potential danger. Character-centric play is the big potential pitfall of Geiger Counter (also why I advocate going back to not having a 1-to-1 survivor/player ratio).<br/><br/>Other than clearing out advantages, I like that (just like the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7623" rel="nofollow">"I don't have to outrun the bear..."</a> idea) it gives the players something to decide about the conflict. Otherwise it's pretty passive -- once the director puts you in the fight you just roll and see your fate. I think the player should have have input into how hard the character fights to live. It lets the players shape the drama even after the director has framed the conflict ("this scene we don't run, we crash the car into it!"). Even if the character is going to die anyway, you can choose to go out in blaze of glory by burning your advantages. But you're right that doesn't mean the knee jerk answer should always be "blaze of glory!"<br/><br/>I'm also hoping that both these rules encourage players to think about their individual character motivations in the scene rather than automatically becoming a unified front. Combined with the outrun the bear option you get some hard choices -- does my guy want to trigger the electric fence now even if it strands the other survivors on the far side with the menace? (go solo instead of grouping, burn the advantage, hope to be the high roller) One bastard with a nice doubled-down advantage can beat the rolls of a bunch of other teamed characters. Hopefully all those temptations push conflict between the characters.<br/><br/>There's also something satisfying about getting to decide your character _isn't_ a bastard and doesn't betray the others (possibly even sacrificing themselves with the bear option to save everyone else).<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Can I just say that Geiger Counter: Gamma has a lovely ring to it?

But it's not about the characters _surviving_ necessarily, which is a kind of investment that people aren't really used to in roleplaying games.  You're supposed to care about the characters but also knowingly put them in harm's way and have them do selfish things that doom them all.  The game really wants the players to look at the big picture: some folks have to die in order for other folks to live.  If anything, that's the theme that might be able to use some additional mechanical support, though I'm not sure yet how to do that.  Perhaps advantage dice only appear on the board once people start taking conditions?  And the groups of 2-3 dice only appear with character deaths?  Something like that might work.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Number6intheVillage</cite>You can't just rely on hoping that players will choose actions that make for a better story.</blockquote>\nI think I disagree with this.

Then it's the player's choice about whether to go all out for one character or to hedge their bets by spreading their influence around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176830/#Comment_176830" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T17:06:10+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  5:06PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2008 5:09PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Number6intheVillage</cite>Identifying with your player position (whether it's a character or not) is the strongest drive in any game.</blockquote>\nTrue, unless you're the GM. Geiger Counter (and other story games) put everyone in a position more like being the GM than being a traditional player.<br/><br/>EDIT: that's not exactly a perfect analogy, but it's close. The players are more about the whole game than just their character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176831/#Comment_176831" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T17:17:15+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  5:17PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or to put it another way, even if you are advocating for your character's place in the story, surviving in the fiction isn't necessarily winning.<br/><br/>I've played GC games where I've absolutely wanted my bastard character to get what was coming to them -- getting killed horribly was my definition of winning. Survival or a boring death were what I was fighting against.<br/><br/>Likewise having your character sacrifice themselves for the one they love or something like that might be your idea of "victory." Which is the point behind the two rules changes -- letting the players decide what's important to their characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177332/#Comment_177332" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T22:48:43+00:00" title="November  4, 2008 10:48PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only believe that collaboration is possible when there are real incentives for each individual.
