Let me change the question a bit; could some extra structure and/or technical tools help make it more likely to work? I'll describe one possible scenario.<br/><br/>(1) The antagonist posts to the group blog, setting the scene. The *tagonists go back fourth via comments until they decide to take it to a conflict. (An OOG comment is left at the blog establishing that this is about to happen.)<br/><br/>(2) The negotiating for a conflict takes place via email (which is more immediate). Each *tagonist posts an equal &amp; parallel intent, along with their choice of praxis (while sending the d4/d10 die split to a 3rd party). Once each side has okayed the other side's intentions, there's six hours for other non-tagonists to chip in Minutae (along with who the minutae will support).<br/><br/>(3) Finally, the third party rolls the dice for all party and emails out the results. The *tagonists who've accomplished their results have 12 hours to post the results<br/><br/>(In steps 2 + 3, it's easy to see how you could make a blog plugin to automate the entering/sharing of players inputs, email notifications, time limits, die rolls &amp; resolution, etc.)<br/><br/>So, a game like this wouldn't quite be "Shock:" as we know it, but might it still be a good specfic game - at least worth me experimenting with?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
