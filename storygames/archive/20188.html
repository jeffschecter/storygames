Earth is almost back to normal and mankind is rebuilding its shattered cities. However, the legacies of The War remain. Super-scientists, mutations, Super-soldiers and aliens walk the Earth. <br/><br/>Many of these are using their abilities to forward their own agenda and only those equal in ability \u2013 Superheroes \u2013 stand a chance of foiling them. The world has come to accept and revere these saviours because of their role in saving the Earth from invasion and preventing its fall into barbarism in the decades following The War.<br/><br/>After fighting in the war, and labouring to rebuild the world, you were finally able to retire last year. Handing your beloved city into the protection of your prot\xe9g\xe9s and replacements, you stepped away from the constant battles. At last you had time to rest, recover and heal, both physically and mentally.<br/><br/>Only now, those self-same prot\xe9g\xe9s are being murdered one by one and evidence is being planted to put the blame onto you and your erstwhile team-mates. And those that are still alive are reluctantly coming to take you in. It\u2019s time to come out of retirement, pull on the old costumes and reform the team for one last adventure.<br/><br/><b>System:</b> Unbounded<br/><b>Slot:</b> Morning<br/><b>GM:</b> Simon Burley<br/><b>Players:</b> 3-5<br/><br/><b>Bark of the Daemons</b><br/><br/>Arestia is a Sword and Sorcery setting. It is a world of many races, but two main warring forces. Many of the planet\u2019s species have six limbs sporting four digits \u2013 for example the Gool, giant four-armed blue trolls who roam the wilderness preying on the unwary. Others sport a mere four limbs which carry five digits a piece, such as the Humans that sit in their walled cities \u2013 sallying forth in armies or armoured caravans to conquer or trade.<br/><br/>Gifted scions amongst both paradigms of lifeform have the ability to manipulate a free-floating energy force known as \u201cmanna\u201d to perform miracles though, to be honest, it is the \u201cfour arms\u201d who seem more adept at this.<br/><br/>You\u2019ve been raised in the human city of Foruthia, a marvellous and invulnerable metropolis spanning hundreds of square miles. Within its many impregnable walls exists all a race would need to survive \u2013 dwellings, farms and mines. You have only rarely been outside the walls.<br/><br/>But when a Caravan \u2013 a huge caterpillar of hundreds of armoured and defended land leviathans \u2013 was put together, you were only too keen to sign on. You\u2019d get to see the wilderness outside the walls of Foruthia and, even, her nearest neighbour Stillartha. So you signed on as caravan guards. <br/><br/>Things have been going well. The few attempts by the Gool and other wilderness creatures to deflect the Caravan have been repulsed. But then, the lovely Cyrintha \u2013 daughter of Lord Droog, the Caravan Master \u2013 allowed her pet Thamba to escape into the forests. Droog, of course, cannot halt the Caravan for such a petty reason and has despatched a small group of guards to enter the wilderness, retrieve the beast and catch up with the Caravan later in its course. <br/><br/>Guess who?<br/><br/><b>System:</b> Unbounded<br/><b>Slot:</b> Afternoon<br/><b>GM:</b> Simon Burley<br/><b>Players: </b>3-5<br/><br/><b>The Forests of the Mind, the Thickets of the Heart</b><br/><br/>You and your friends are crammed into your aging hatchback on your way home from the coolest festival ever!

There\u2019s some debate about whether to stop and offer help, but something on the sallow expressions sported by the figures caught in your headlights is disturbing, so you drive on by.<br/><br/>Just as your conscience kicks in and some of you suggest you turn around to go back and offer help, your engine coughs and dies. As the car comes to a juddering halt, all the lights slowly die, leaving you in the dark.<br/><br/>The Dweller in the Dark is a scenario of mystery and terror. It will last exactly two and a half hours \u2013 to allow me to run for my train \u2013 making it ideal for those who \u2013 like me \u2013 have to leave early.

It was a fairly boring and mundane farming community with a small side industry in timber. There was also a fairly large halfling community (several hundred) under his rule. But the townsfolk accused them of thievery, foul practices, and curdling goat milk. Of course far more importantly, King Connolly found their beady little eyes unattractive so he called a pogrom to burn their holes and drive them from their apple orchards. They fled as refugees into the great forest to the north.<br/><br/>Later King Connolly realised their apple brandy and other luxury goods made up a good portion of his revenues. As his own inbred peasants were far too daft and unskilled to take over the orchard he has promised a reward of 1000 pieces of silver to any who can bring back the halflings to work their orchards and pay their taxes.<br/><br/><b>System:</b> Lamentations of the Flame Princess.

You are a group of exiled Ronin, who believe that your master\u2019s death was not from natural causes. Now Princess Yuki has sought you out with evidence that her stepmother\u2019s family have indeed usurped the throne. She plans to break into the shrine of the Silver Dragon and steal back her father\u2019s magical sword, but will need the help of his loyalist samurai to do so. Intrigue and espionage abound as you infiltrate the capital city in a bid to restore the princess to her throne.<br/><br/>(up to seven players, morning)</blockquote>\nBut I'd like some more! If you're thinking of offering a game on the day, please let me know and I can add it to the list!<br/><br/>We could also do with a few more raffle prizes, to go with <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow#GOOD_CAUSES.3F" rel="nofollow">the ones we have already</a>.

I've kind of lost track of who's offered what where, so here are the most recent game offers. Full details, as usual, on the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow games list</a>.\n<blockquote><b>World War Cthulhu: Fugazi! Saigon 1967</b><br/>As an Operative of the CIA your posting to Vietnam has been everything you hoped and more.<br/><br/>You\u2019re rich men here, no matter how poor your start in life. The Dollar opens doors you could only dream of passing through at home. You answer to almost no-one and you have a freedom with your operations in \u2018Nam that you know you\u2019ll probably never have again. You also have air conditioning, cold beer and all the female company money can buy.<br/><br/>Life is good.<br/><br/>Or it was until that older Spook turned up. It was then you realised that there was a price to pay for the good times, and Uncle Sam was calling in His marker.<br/><br/>A Call of Cthulhu adventure set in the World War Cthulhu: Cold War environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><b>Deadlands (Original Weird West): Silver Mining Mountain</b><br/>The Silver Mountain Mining Company is looking for a posse of troubleshooters.<br/><br/>Some of their miners are missing in tribal lands. All should have been fine, but the two clerks in the local office are good at pen pushing not using a six shooter, so help need. Find them and the rewards good.<br/><br/>Feeling brave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote><b>Primetime Adventures: Star Wars: Rebels of Mos Eisley</b><br/>It is a period of civil war. Rebel freedom fighters, operating as a secret cell in Mos Eisley, have won victories against the evil Galactic Empire. But when their mentor is arrested by Stormtroopers, can they free her before Imperial interrogation droids extract their identities from her? Are these Star Wars rebels guardians of the galaxy, or nothing but a wretched hive of scum and villainy?<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures is the classic indie game of television melodrama. It's a mechanics-light GM'd game in the same general vein as Fiasco or Hillfolk.</blockquote>\n<b><i>Raffle</i></b><br/>The <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow#GOOD_CAUSES.3F" rel="nofollow">raffle prize list</a> is looking enticing, with a distinctly non-trivial line up of prizes on offer. Many thanks to everyone who's donating prizes. There's still room for more, so please let me know if you have something you'd like to offer.<br/><br/><b><i>Housekeeping</i></b><br/>Finally, a couple of house-keeping reminders. I've taken heed of comments on the sign-up system we trialled last time. We'll be using the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games#Sign-up_process" rel="nofollow">tombola system</a> again, but for all three slots, and you'll keep the same number all day. Afternoon call-ups will be in reverse order of the morning, with the evening call-up in a whole new order. Groups pre-pick one number/person for the whole group to use. Full details on the link.<br/><br/>There's been no call for the lunch curry this time, so we won't be doing it. Please let me know what you think of this decision! There's plenty of food around. I recommend Buskers, but there's plenty on Wolverton high street, and there's always Tesco.<br/><br/>See you on Saturday!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448571/#Comment_448571" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-16T13:56:45+00:00" title="September 16, 2015  1:56PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did it go?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448574/#Comment_448574" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-16T15:04:21+00:00" title="September 16, 2015  3:04PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a damn good con: Neil would have to give you the exact attendance figures, but about 60-70 different individuals through the day in 25-30 different games.
