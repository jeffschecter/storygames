I played Christian, a bookish academic who was vulnerable because his wife had died two weeks previously.  James played Harry, a policeman who was vulnerable because of his inflexible moral code.  Harry knew Christian as they were childhood friends.  Steve played Dale, Harry\u2019s son who was vulnerable because he was obsessed with a woman.<br/><br/>I had played the game once before at the inaugural meet and Steve and James had not played although both had the rulesets.  I found <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13584&amp;page=1#Item_13" rel="nofollow">this link</a> and my previous experience useful in thinking about playing the game (basically minimal role-play, maximal story-telling).  Initially James and I went berserk, claiming at every opportunity whereas Steve was much more restrained.  We started to invent a world much like \u2018V for Vendetta\u2019 (the graphic novel, not the film with Hugo Weaving\u2019s ridiculous voice that goes up and down like a Bride\u2019s nightie).  <br/><br/>The \u2018Laying Foundations\u2019 stage was great.  Christian out  in the evening and it was getting close to curfew.  He was terrified of getting trapped on the streets and trying to stay in a shabby hotel.  Harry was confronting anarchists who were intent on a bombing campaign.  Dale obsessively following a red-headed woman (I claimed that!).  Christian discovering that his deceased wife Veronica had possible links with the anarchists.  Harry also finding a file called \u2018Red Soup\u2019 at work that seems to confirm Veronica\u2019s involvement.  Dale finding another part of the file in a duffel bag at home.  The police raiding Harry\u2019s house.<br/><br/>We were claiming and having moments on a regular basis \u2013 It was fantastic but then this is where my doubt started to creep in.  Whilst the story was great I was thinking \u201cwho or what is the vampire.\u201d  I felt that we were putting our faith in a process that involved us possibly having to undermine one another\u2019s mental picture of what the vampire was.  I think James and Steve were having similar thoughts.  Steve helpfully instigated a conversation about what we all thought the vampire was.  Steve said that he thought it was the state \u2013 I can\u2019t remember what James said (sorry) and I said I thought it was something that was feeding off the conflict between the two sides.<br/><br/>I felt the end petered out a little for a number of reasons:<br/><br/>Annalise is a game of character intimacy which also relies on player intimacy.  I hadn\u2019t gamed with James or Steve before and while it was a pleasure I was concerned with not wanting to dominate the fiction.  We talked about it after and I don\u2019t think they disagreed.  I wished that there was something a bit more mechanical to resolve this.<br/><br/>Running the game in a four hour slot is a tough ask.  I appreciate that the game can be run over several sessions and I think Nathan did not design it for such a tight focus.  I\u2019m wondering about further mods I could possibly make.  I thought the one-moment-per-scene idea was good as was the idea of fewer coins on Core Traits.  Maybe a limit to the number of claims in play.  I\u2019m keen to run it again with three as the last time I facilitated five other players and that didn\u2019t work as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310769/#Comment_310769" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T06:59:15+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  6:59AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Piers, thanks for writing this up, and thanks for playing! <br/><br/>As you point out, a four-hour slot doesn't really play to the game's strengths. I agree that one-moment-per-scene is good, as is reduced Core coins (if you look at the Guided Play Scenarios, those characters start with less coins and with some traits already created. I would try this:<br/><br/>Split 7 coins between your two Core Traits. For each Core Trait, create a Satellite Trait. Put 3 coins on one of them and 4 on another. (This is to give your character a couple hooks into Moments right off the bat, which I imagine could be helpful)<br/><br/>As for the Vampire, it's funny - one of the really deeply satisfying parts of long-term Annalise play is the balancing act of not-quite-defining what or who the Vampire is <i>yet</i>, and then hitting that moment when you finally "figure out" its identity. Unfortunately, this is diametrically opposed to satisfying short-term play. Really, for a one-shot game, I don't think there's any problem with flat-out stating "this is the Vampire" at the beginning of the game. This is kind of what some of the Guided Play Scenarios do - Dracula Reloaded pretty much tells you that Dracula is the Vampire, The Crossroads Of Sanctuary and Salvation aims you at Quentin Drake, and The Wake of Zenas Quantum pretty much implies that you'll be concerned with Zenas Quantum.<br/><br/>Alternately, enjoy the unfolding drama without pushing it towards a specific Vampire. I don't see anything wrong with letting the Vampire drop out of the fiction, especially if you won't be playing the Confrontation phase.<br/><br/>How do those thoughts strike you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310969/#Comment_310969" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T19:44:05+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  7:44PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shall we put all ARPG Club Annalise AP here, do you think?

I'd like to play Annalise over a few sessions but at the moment my gaming is once a month and I think that Annalise would work better if the episodes were closer together.  <br/><br/>I did bypass the guided play for aesthetic reasons.  I avoided the 'Dracula Reloaded' as I thought it was a bit obvious and 'Zenas Quantum' as I'm not a superhero fan.  However, I think I will give the Dracula scenario a go next time or be explicit about the Vampire and yes, the game is enjoyable without a vampire.<br/><br/>I also wanted to say that I thought the rulebook was really well written.  I have had a bit of a beef with some of them which I didn't find too helpful for the beginner (or the late returner to RPGs) but Annalise is spot on.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: framweard</cite>Shall we put all ARPG Club Annalise AP here, do you think?
