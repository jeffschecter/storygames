He suggested that I re-posted it publicly, because it may be helpful both to him and to other people.  The only thing better than learning from your own mistakes is learning from someone else's. (Well, not better perhaps, but easier and less painful)<br/><br/>(Alexander and Mike: I will look over Ensemble and City of Masks, but I'm not sure exactly when I'll get the chance.  Hopefully over the next couple of weeks though.)<br/><br/>EDIT: Blimey, I've just noticed that this is HUGE.  Ah well, if it's useful to someone out there other than Jason it's worth posting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79607/#Comment_79607" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T08:58:27+00:00" title="July  5, 2007  8:58AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are my notes after a read over of the rules.  I think everything<br/>appears to be here, I'm not really scratching my head about anything<br/>really and I don't think there's anything missing from the text.  Some<br/>better referencing and summaries would really help.  For example,<br/>there's no summary of the game's structure at the start.  Knowing the<br/>game's structure helps put everything in context, so trying to<br/>understand some stuff early on is harder until you have that overview.<br/> The top two paragraphs on page six are probably the first thing I<br/>needed to know after the "WELCOME TO BUSINESS SOLUTIONS!" part.<br/><br/>I also had a few issues with certain rules.  Mainly this comes down to<br/>the following:<br/><br/>It's a competitive game.  Which is cool and all.  But then there are<br/>rules where players can choose to give bonus cards to the other<br/>players.  Why would you do that in a competitive game?  You're letting<br/>the other players get an advantage over you.  So you can't really play<br/>this game flat out, you need to keep tempering that desire to win and<br/>to play aggressively with that reward mechanic.  Which is really not<br/>working for me.  Also that whole thing with agreeing on the number of<br/>cards you get from winning a conflict, which I go in to later.<br/><br/>Now, it could be that these aren't legitimate complaints, but if<br/>they're not, I'm making them because something isn't in the book that<br/>needs to be.<br/><br/>Anyway, it looks like a lot of fun if those problems can be solved,<br/>and I look forward to seeing future versions.  Light-hearted, simple,<br/>zero preparation, all great stuff.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Rich                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79608/#Comment_79608" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T08:59:35+00:00" title="July  5, 2007  8:59AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Page 1</b><br/><br/>Techs work in pairs.<br/><br/>Exactly 3 players.  I guess that makes player 3 the Gm.<br/><br/>Six Scenes.  So timed and limited.<br/><br/>Cards.<br/><br/>Choose a buzzword.  Very much like The Big Idea.<br/><br/><b>Page 2</b><br/><br/>I see, the description of the buzzword needs to ambiguous, not just<br/>the word itself.<br/><br/>Also, on page 1 it looked like everyone created a buzzword to choose<br/>from, but in the example only two of those players do.<br/><br/><b>Creating Characters.</b><br/><br/>Ah, I see now that:<br/><br/>a) There actually isn't a GM, but that each player will control a pair<br/>of repairmen each.<br/><br/>b) The buzzword is what we will call the Mojo stat for this session.<br/><br/><b>Types.</b><br/><br/>Hang on, The overview of the character creation says there are  "Each<br/>character has a Type, a Need, and some cards allocated to their Mojo".<br/> But now I'm told that he also has "an attitude and a role", which<br/>contradicts that.  This is cleared up quickly though.<br/><br/>Hmm, divvying up the attitudes and roles.  Choose one of each for<br/>character one, then one of each for character two, or choose two of<br/>each and then figure out how you arrange them?<br/><br/><b>Page 3</b><br/><br/><b>Needs</b><br/><br/>Technobedience is a very cool word.  There are no hits for it on google.<br/><br/><b>Mojo and status</b><br/><br/>Is it actually a good idea to give all your cards to one character or<br/>should you attempt the balanced approach?  This is advice, but people<br/>want to know.<br/><br/>You place the cards face down, but do you look at them yourself?  Page<br/>one implies not.<br/><br/>What's the effect of being the Lead or Trainee?  Obviously this will<br/>be explained later, but a quick sentence summarising now might be<br/>nice.<br/><br/><b>Page 4</b><br/><br/><b>Creating Clients</b><br/><br/>WHOA!!  Take 13 cards from the client deck?  WTF is that?  I assume<br/>it's the remaining cards form that double megadeck, the ones which<br/>aren't currently in character's Mojo Stacks?<br/><br/>So these 13 cards are randomly dealt to the player, right, not one<br/>suit from one deck or something?<br/><br/><b>The basic rule.</b><br/><br/>Yup, that's pretty basic.  Except I'm not yet sure what the "Active<br/>Player" means.  At this point I'm starting to fathom what I think the<br/>structure of the game is.  It seems like there is a series of scenes<br/>and it each scene there is a GM and two characters (one from from each<br/>of the other players).  There is a conflict in that scene and the<br/>players who are controlling characters keep their cards after that<br/>scene as a discard pile for use in the endgame.<br/><br/>At least, that's how I currently think the game is played, since it<br/>hasn't yet been covered in an overview.  So I'm looking at all these<br/>rules so far with little or no context, which is making them harder to<br/>grasp.<br/><br/><b>Page 6</b><br/><br/><b>Scene structure.</b><br/><br/>Ah, I see that I am right.<br/><br/>The order of who plays what in each scene looks like there is probably<br/>a really easy way to represent in graphically.  having that as a<br/>printable document which the players fill in as they go along and just<br/>tells you who goes what when is probably a good idea.<br/><br/>(looking at the back, the Ticket sheet looks like the right approach).<br/><br/><b>The Set Up</b><br/><br/>I have a slight advantage here in that I'm a Systems Admin and thus<br/>can make up any old technical sounding crap to explain why something<br/>isn't working and have it sound OK.  I appreciate that a lot of people<br/>don't have that skill, so a list of likely problems and their causes<br/>would be cool.<br/><br/>(Later I notice that there is actually such a list in the back.<br/>Perhaps mentioning this in the text will speed things up)<br/><br/>Relationship challenges confused me slightly.  Let me check if I<br/>understand this:<br/><br/>* This challenge relates to one of the repairmen characters present.<br/><br/>* The Client player chooses which character.<br/><br/>* The Client player chooses an available Attitude and a Role for the<br/>relationship (and crosses them off the list)<br/><br/>* The Client player then chooses (in secret) how many cards that<br/>challenge is worth<br/><br/>* The player of that repairman decides exactly who the relationship is<br/>with.  That is, they invent what in days of old would be called an NPC<br/>and decide exactly what relationship they have with them.<br/><br/>Reading the example, I think I am correct, but wasn't sure until I<br/>read the example.<br/><br/>One question though is that there are six scenes and six characters,<br/>does this mean that each repairman gets exactly one relationship<br/>challenge during the game?<br/><br/>(I'm not familiar with the term Scut Monkey, but I'm thinking it's<br/>much the same as Shitboy. ie someone in the very lowest position who<br/>everyone else looks down on).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79609/#Comment_79609" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T08:59:53+00:00" title="July  5, 2007  8:59AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2007 9:00AM by Rich Stokes.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Page 8</b><br/><br/><b>The Trouble Ticket</b><br/><br/>Really nitpicky here, but I think the apostrophy in the third sentence<br/>is in the wrong place. and I think that makes the sentence mean<br/>something other than what it's supposed to.<br/><br/>It says:<br/><br/>"Any of the active player's characters can take the call"<br/><br/>Whereas I think it's supposed to say:<br/><br/>"Any of the active players character's can take the call"<br/><br/>Or have I misunderstood?<br/><br/><b>Allocating Mojo.</b><br/><br/>I have to allocate Mojo without any idea of how many cards I'm up<br/>against?  I really don't like that.<br/><br/>Also I had no idea that the relationship challenge applied to both<br/>characters.  I thought it was just the one character.<br/><br/><b>Page 9</b><br/><br/><b>Earning bonus cards</b><br/><br/>Bonus for playing in type: Not fond of this type of rule, but it's<br/>pretty clear.  (I'm of the opinion that such rewards aren't actually<br/>"a reward for making the game more fun and interesting", they rely far<br/>too heavily on the other players being interested in awarding points,<br/>which most aren't.  They're interested in *earning* points.)<br/><br/><b>Finding the problem.</b><br/><br/>This seems very arbitrary.  That is, there is no guidance for or<br/>restriction on the relationship between the problem's symptoms and<br/>cause.  Reading ahead, I see that there are just four possible causes<br/>for each problem, and that's that.  But that hasn't been explained<br/>yet, it probably should have been somewhere around page 6.<br/><br/>I also assume that the list of Causes and effects is out in the open<br/>and available for use during the game?<br/><br/>Also, here's a thing.  I can infer that you put your allocated Mojo<br/>cards one at a time and make a guess with each card.  Or maybe you put<br/>them all forward together and then take turns guessing?  If you put<br/>forward 4 or more cards, is there any point to that part of the scene?<br/> Maybe an a chance to fish for bonus cards from the other players.<br/><br/>Most importantly: If you put in only one, two or three cards and don't<br/>guess correctly, can you then spend bonus cards for extra guesses?<br/><br/><b>Page 10</b><br/><br/><b>Fixing the problem.</b><br/><br/>It's not really made clear exactly what happens when the Client wins.<br/>In the example the characters don't have the parts, but I assume that<br/>the only hard and fast rule is that the copier isn't fixed straight<br/>away.<br/><br/>What happens if I lose and don't have any unused Mojo card?<br/><br/><b>Page 11</b><br/><br/><b>Relationship challenges</b><br/><br/>"The active players should reveal a card whenever they move toward<br/>resolving the challenge until they are unwilling (or unable) to spend<br/>any more."  Hang on, don't you allocate Mojo to this challenge at the<br/>start of the scene?  So how can you be unwilling to spend any more,<br/>surely they're spend already?  Or does this just mean bonus cards?  Do<br/>we play the scene until the point where the conflict needs to be<br/>resolved and then compare cards, or do we compare cards and then play<br/>the scene out according to what they tell us?  It seems to imply that<br/>what happens is that you roleplay out the scene, turning cards over<br/>every now and them and when you run out the scene is over unless you<br/>spend bonus cards.<br/><br/>(This, again, is explained later)<br/><br/><b>Page 12</b><br/><br/>This example shows me another problem: The whole "you get no cards if<br/>you can't agree the distribution thing really doesn't seem like a good<br/>idea.  For example, if I don't want you to get any cards, I can<br/>guarantee that you don't by just demanding all three cards.  If you<br/>agree, I get all three and you get none.  If you don't agree, you<br/>still get none.  So this is potentially open for all kinds of abuse.<br/><br/><b>Calling Tech Support</b><br/><br/>Do I call my own character if I have Tech Support cards?  Or ther<br/>other Active player's?  Or anyone's (including the current Client<br/>Player's)?<br/><br/>(on a later re-read I see that Tech Support cards do not belong to<br/>anyone.  It's actually reasonably clear and I missed it.)<br/><br/>Also, does this mean that a total of 4 calls can be made during a<br/>scene (One call to anothor technician and one call to Tech Support per<br/>character)?<br/><br/><b>Page 13</b><br/><br/><b>End game</b><br/><br/>"The goal of the game is to have the character with the highest number<br/>of victory points at the conclusion of scene six."<br/><br/>This is at odds with a number of other mechanics in the game.  For<br/>example, why would I give any bonus cards to someone, when we are<br/>competing?  Frankly, what's in it for me?  Why would I ever agree to<br/>take less than two extra Mojo cards for being part of the winning side<br/>in a challenge?  If I take one and he gets two, he's still got more<br/>than me and I'd be better off not letting him get any.<br/><br/><b>Determining Victory Points.</b><br/><br/>Do unspent bonus cards count for nothing in the endgame?  I assume<br/>they don't help since they are not mentioned, but it's not explicitly<br/>stated.<br/><br/>The more cards you play during the game, the more of both red and<br/>black you will end up with.  Since you can ditch one Black card per<br/>scene, the optimal strategy would appear to be to play two cards per<br/>scene and on average you ought to be able to do OK.  Although I'd have<br/>to play the game a couple of times to see if that was correct.  It<br/>appears that the winner might also just be the guy with the most<br/>unspent Mojo at the end of the game.<br/><br/><b>All Hands Meeting.</b><br/><br/>What if you are tied for both first and last place?<br/><br/>You can get into a weird situation where you fire yourself.  That is,<br/>one of your characters wins and the other loses.  Not a problem<br/>really, just interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79613/#Comment_79613" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T09:31:08+00:00" title="July  5, 2007  9:31AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2007 9:35AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again for this rigorous and thoughtful examination, Rich!
