I chose it for two reasons, first because I was interested in experimenting with some of the ideas put forward by the Old School Renaissance follks, and secondly because OD&amp;D has a rather explicit turn based structure, and a relatively low number of die rolls, which seemed compatible with Twitter as a medium.<br/><br/>I decided to run the game on Twitter because I don't have time in my schedule for more sustained face-to-face gaming time, but I can find 10 minutes here and 15 minutes there to devote to it. I was also inspired by a post by the Chatty DM, who outlined an experimental Twitter RPG protocol.<br/><br/>I have played PbP games in the past, and typically found that they petered out in players fell away after a fairly short time.  I was curious to see if the Twitter dynamic would be any different. One of the obstacles I myself have found in the past with PbP was a bit of an issue with "writer's block" when posting, as the nature of forums tends to make you feel you need to go on at length.  I was hoping the natural 140 character limit of Twitter would help avoid that, and encourage us to keep things moving.<br/><br/>So far, things have gone quite well. I discovered early on that another essential tool in addition to Twitter has been Google Docs.  Twitter provides chatter around the table if you will, and Google Docs provides the character sheets, loot lists, and other information you'd normally right down.  The ability to create shared documents among the players is very handy.  Another handy tool is Twitpic (or similar services), I've been drawing battle maps on paper, photographing them with my camera phone, and posted them to the twitter stream so that players have a visual reference when making tactical decisions.<br/><br/>The general experience for me has been fairly similar to a greatly slowed down experience of face-to-face play.  Because of the IM like short message nature of Twitter, the game has remained chatty, which I like.  While I am personally acquainted with all the players, the players are not all personally acquainted with each other outside of the game.  One of the players has commented to me on the strangeness of engaging with other peoples fictional personalities, rather than the persons themselves.<br/><br/>So what are the pros and cons?  Well for me the primary pro is the ability to have another game in progress that I would not otherwise be able to fit into my schedule.  As the GM its also nice to have the luxury to ponder rulings without feeling like I'm slowing the game down.  The main drawback I would say is the slow pace of play, although in a way that can also be a bit of a pro, in that it is fun to have this slow burn thing going on that I can dip into for a few minutes here or there throughout the day.  Because I can access Twitter both from my computer and from my phone, I can check in with the game whenever I have a few free moments.  Again the fact that the game materials and notes are online in Google Docs is a big win here.<br/><br/>I can be difficult when something comes up where I need to see clarification on a statement by a player.  Since not everybody is online at the same time, a request for clarification may linger for several hours before being responded to.  And given the already slow pace of play, I don't wish to slow things down further.  However usually generous applications of common sense help me muddle through.<br/><br/>Finally of course there is the issue with any electronic medium is that you've stripped away the body language, which is an essential part of judging the other players moods in any FtF game. Fortunately, I think all of us who are playing in this game have tried to make an extra effort to communicate their feelings as player in addition to any feelings their characters may be expressing. So the characters can engage in insults and banter without this spilling over into the player space.  I've also been trying to take extra effort to keep aware of where I might have accidentally stepped on somebodies fun.  Twitter direct messages can help here, as an out-of-band mechanism by which I can tap someone on the shoulder and say "you okay with that?" without disrupting the main flow of play.<br/><br/>Apart from that though, I am explicitly avoiding "private play", even though that might be considered easy to do in the electronic medium. Just like with a tabletop game, I want all the game knowledge to be out there for all players to enjoy, despite what their characters might or might not know.<br/><br/>Oh, and one other question people might have... Dice.  In this game I am handling all the dice rolls, but I do post the raw die results and any calculations resulting from them for any rolls the players would normally make.  I also role some of my GM dice "in the open" posting the results.  This is both so that the players can "check my work" and make sure I'm not making any mistakes (forgetting a bonus for example) and also so that players can have some mechanical feedback that they can factor into their decision making.  I have been doing some "hidden information" rolls, like listening at doors, with out posting the rolls.  As for the actual rolls themselves, I use random.org, so if things go badly for the players, they will have no recourse but to understand that atmospheric noise hates them <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>That is my somewhat stream of consciousness experience with Twitter roleplaying, which I haven't the time to go back and edit.

I've never been able to enjoy a play-by-post game. It's hard for me pinpoint why, but I think it has something to do with magnifying the importance of verbiage and making the essence of what's going on harder to find. In a PbP game with lots of ongoing description, I get lost and forget the thread of the action .That never happens in Twitter. <br/><br/>Also, I have a busy, but flexible schedule. A couple of action tweets a day is the perfect pace for me. I'm pretty happy to be able to scratch my old-school itch a little every day in Wilhelm's game.<br/><br/>I have an ongoing question about the skills involved. What makes for good Twitter play as opposed to bad? Wilhelm raised the point of in-vs-out of character tweeting, which wasn't even on my radar. I also highly recommend having a dedicated Twitter account for your character. It adds to the overhead of logging in and out, but it makes it much easier to organize things and avoids spamming your followers with non sequitur game posts.<br/><br/>Trevis: Universalis by Twitter's a pretty interesting idea...

Those that did not were those who didn't have twitter accounts to begin with, or had accounts that they weren't really using anyway.<br/><br/>As to what Twitter provides vs other similar electronic mediums, for me the biggest feature has been that Twitter has the conversational feel of IM, but without requiring all the participants to be connected simultaneously.  Twitter's not perfect at this, getting the setup just right means every player account and the GM account all have to be following each other, but once we worked out the logistics, it's actually be quite smooth.<br/><br/>In contact to other mediums: Wikis lack an obvious linear structure, which I think is essential for carrying the main thrust of play.  With Twitter you've got an obvious timeline.  Now I imagine a Wiki could be useful for holding the supporting documents (character sheets, notes, loot lists, etc), but Google Docs was handy, didn't require me to set up any software, and all the free wiki hosting sites I'm aware of are noisy and overfeatured by comparison.<br/><br/>As to forum posts, I can only report my own experience, which is that play in those formats drifts toward long descriptive posts, and then at some point I start feeling writers block, so I stop posting for awhile, and the loose the habit, forget to check in, and other people do the same, an the game grinds to a halt.  I think format of Twitter is such that you don't feel intimidate to throw off a quick response, when you check in there isn't pages of stuff to read, so you check in fairly frequently, and the whole energy of the thing stays high.

We're discussing the prospect with these conditions:<br/>* Minimal crunch and handling -- HERO System is right out.<br/>* Minimal back-and-forth in a conflict -- DitV seems too much, IAWA might be a sweet spot.<br/>* Ability to add players at will -- almost any game works, but those with Tenets or Oracles cut out some of the fun for late-comers.<br/><br/>That''s actually got me thinking IAWA (though new players miss on Oracle fun) and Amber, of all things. Universalis would be a great go-to, but so much of it involves cooperative setting building that I'd be doubtful someone would jump in without that initial buy-in.<br/><br/>Anyway... other ideas? Am I not thinking of something key to this sort of "bursty play"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215364/#Comment_215364" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T09:40:15+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  9:40AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the game that I'm starting up we've been talking about using John's Danger Patrol, but at this point it would just be a cargo-cult hack of it, since there isn't really a doc of the current game.

Seriously, I'm considering starting up my own game set on the American side of the pond, since I don't really see how I am going to fit into theirs (although I've enjoyed reading it).  The cool thing that totally set their game up is a photo of some graffiti that they're using as a mystic sign; I'd recommend doing something similar early on in any game done in that style.<br/><br/>In fact, if anyone is interested, I'll facilitate.  Whisper to me, or DM me on Twitter (<a href="/forums/profile/ccreitz%29">@ccreitz)</a>.  I'll kick off if there's any response \u2014 we'll use our regular accounts (if we like) and a short, noisy hashtag.  I like the idea that the same "you" who tweets about sandwiches or funny things you see while driving occasionally writes a paranoid observation about an occult conspiracy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
