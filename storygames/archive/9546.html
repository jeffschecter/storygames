An "archiving mechanic" is basically a rule that makes recording elements of the gameplay experience a part of the gameplay process.<br/><br/>So, for example, I'm adding a thing to <a href="http://neko-machi.com/dsg/raspberry_heaven_playtest_0.3.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Heaven</a> where after each session you sit down and write down the most memorable thing that happened, and that in turn becomes mechanically significant in future sessions. If you play the game a bunch, you wind up with a bunch of "memories" that you can invoke by playing certain cards.<br/><br/>Another example I heard on a podcast (and I suck and can't remember which one) was someone was running SotC, and applying new Aspects to the setting based on the PCs' actions.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm wondering if there are any other such games (or hacks of games, or fragments of games, or whatever) out there, and how they work, and how well they work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211809/#Comment_211809" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T20:40:53+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  8:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 8:41PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on what you mean by "elements of the game experience."<br/><br/>In Burning Wheel you mark down the tests you've made, which skills you've spent Artha on, and Let it Ride successes.

In one campaign I tried having a wiki with setting info and session summaries, but the players largely lost interest in it after a while. To some extent, I've just taken this as a sign that my group isn't suited to elaborate campaigns, but it's also gotten me interested in rules that do that kind of archiving as a natural extension of play.<br/><br/>Dictionary of Mu is a really neat example, and I really don't know why I didn't think about it. In hindsight, it's probably another of the things that got me thinking about this stuff. It does this "archiving" stuff partly by making the archive a central feature of the game in the first place.<br/><br/>I'll have to make time to check out the other games mentioned here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oreso" title="oreso"><img alt="oreso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oreso">oreso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211927/#Comment_211927" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T09:23:29+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  9:23AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2009 9:23AM by oreso.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is one of the main design goals of our <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://pcdw.wikidot.com/games:the-wire" rel="nofollow">The Wire style game</a>.

Your character's stats and the setting's "cues" are generated by what happens in play.<br><br>And in <a href="http://agora.kallistipress.com" rel="nofollow">Agora</a>, you can archive your opportunity cards, which can create a 'book' of what has happened on your Agora.  The obstacle library is also a persistent thing that gets modified as you play, and you see the same obstacles come back, slowly changing just as your character changes as they survive and build Agora.  The library also overwrites itself, though, so I suppose it's a pretty crappy archive.<br/><br/>However, I find that archiving mechanics are generally cumbersome beasts.  unWritten works for me because you jot down a very punchy single line and move on.  Agora's "book" is mostly a side-effect nifty thing you can do.  I have seen a lot of games attempt to "create a record of the story you play" but in my opinion, they often fail because they require far too much handling time or do not distill the experience of play into the archive, whatever format it takes.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211968/#Comment_211968" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T11:24:29+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 11:24AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hunh.

You represent _everything_ that's happened in a big expanding grid. The players have to be able to see everything that's happened simultaneously, because they can jump to any point of the history at any time and expand upon it.<br/><br/>(more discussion of the logistical nightmares of fractal gaming: <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/121/the-past-is-never-closed-and-other-data-storage-problems/" rel="nofollow">The Past is Never Closed, and other data storage problems</a>)<br/><br/>But I'd say Geiger Counter maps are the coolest game artifact hands down.

The Questionnaire looks like this:<br/><br/>1. <b>Recall a pleasant memory</b><br/>When I think of [blank], I remember:<br/><br/>What was pleasant about it?<br/><br/><br/>2. <b>Recall an unpleasant memory</b><br/>When I think of [blank], I remember:<br/><br/>What was unpleasant about it?<br/><br/><br/>3. <b>Recall how you came to be here</b><br/>When I think of [blank], I remember:<br/><br/>How did you lose your memory?<br/><br/><br/>Do you want to remember your past? [yes/no]<br/><br/><br/>So, basically, the Questionnaire is the procedure of play, and as you go through that procedure everyone ends up with a nice tidy record of what their character did, and the growth they come to (or not) at the end.<br/><br/>Also, you can only go through each question when you have enough pennies (a mechanical element; you get one when you finish a story, and you can get others by saying an action for someone else's character that they then choose to have happen in the fiction). So, to begin your pleasant memory, you must have two pennies, to begin your unpleasant one you need three pennies, and to recall how you came to be at the Orphic Institute with no memories, you need four pennies.<br/><br/>I think this one is a winning example of "archiving as the process of play", Ewen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
