Many gamers who still believe that "system doesn't matter" do so because basically they've settled on a "game" of their own making without really be aware of that.  So whatever game you hand them they continue to play the game they're most familiar with and will hack or ignore any rule in the given game to make it work with the local game they've been playing for years.  All changing the game does for this person is change the color but the actual *game* (i.e. rewarded social dynamic) remains constant from campaign to campaign.<br/><br/>Being able to draw attention to something that isn't 2d10 + Skill vs. TN by calling it a procedure or a technique helps draw attention to the parts people don't normally think of as being part of the system/game but which are often vital particularly in how they feed and are informed by the resolution mechanic.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322277/#Comment_322277" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T12:24:57+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 12:24PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2011 12:26PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Jesse said.<br/><br/>I'd only add that for me I use the words this way (and this is only for my own thinking, not some from-on-high declaration)...<br/><br/>* Mechanics are where uncertainty and the fiction meet. ("I'm swinging my axe and I've got a Strength of 3, so I'm using 3 dice.")<br/><br/>* Procedures are all the things the game says to do with moving forward with the game to play it properly (ie: as written) (In <i>Sorcerer</i>, all Players author a Kicker for their Characters; if you don't do this, you're not really playing <i>Sorcerer</i>; "If you want to do something, check your Character's Score in the relevant attribute and pick up that many dice")<br/><br/>* Techniques are the things I do as a player (of any flavor) to help along the Mechanics and Procedures. (If a Player gets stuck on creating a Kicker, as Game Master I'll ask questions, tapping all the other information the Player has already written down on the Character sheet. Asking questions of the Players in Sorcerer is a Technique for me, because it really isn't in the <i>Sorcerer</i> rules anywhere. In Apocalypse World, asking questions would be a Procedure.)<br/><br/><br/>You can find a much more sophisticated break down of these kinds of things at this <a href="http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=579" rel="nofollow">amazing post</a> by Vincent Baker over at Lumpley.com.

"Everyone gets four scenes." "Move the characters tokens to the stage they're on for the scene" "Decide what hollywood actor would play your character" "Choose whether you escape into the night, recant, or burn at the stake" - procedures<br/><br/>"Don't narrate another player's character's thoughts." "Make Apocalypse World seem real" "Try to make good things happen for your character." "draw a veil if the subject matter is uncomfortable for you" - techniques<br/><br/>"2d10 + Skill vs. TN" "After your fifth experience point, mark improvement." "When you fall below 0 hit points, you're unconscious." "If you lose the roll, get back your pool dice +1" "When you act on your key, gain xp." - mechanics<br/><br/>But then there's gray areas. What's Archipelago's "Draw a Resolution card and interpret the results" - is that a procedure, mechanic, technique - or a mix?  Polaris's flowchart of key phrases - procedure or mechanic? "Roll 3d6 to determine each stat" - procedure or mechanic?<br/><br/>One difference is purpose: a mechanic is usually there to softly incent player behavior. ("I better not roll, because I'll probably lose," or "I better roll, because I'll get xp" or "I better act roguish, so I can draw a card." or "I better play to my weaknesses so I can go on the owe list.") Mechanics might take a while to kick in, because the players won't realize until after multiple playing the value of the incentives. And a player might always choose to ignore the mechanic.<br/><br/>A technique or procedure, otoh, usually demands a certain player behavior. It's the rule. You have to do this. If you don't "Make Apocalypse World seem real", then you're not playing Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>Procedures are directions. Recipes. The way indie games have explored these over the past several years have really blown the lid off, IMO. The setup phases for In a Wicked Age or Fiasco - Apocalypse World GMing - they're more likely to deliver consistent experiences to different groups than mechanics, like Jesse said.<br/><br/>Techniques, too, but they are more vague. Like, okay, *how* do we make Apocalypse World real? *How* do we make good things happen, and what's a good thing?<br/>The ultimate vague technique would be "Tell a good story and have fun." (Yay, I've just created the best story game ever.) <br/>Still, I think they're probably more effective at delivering consistency than pure mechanics. Simply telling a player to "Be a hero" might be more likely to produce heroism than crafting a set of mechanics that rewards heroism.<br/><br/>(EDIT: cross-posted with Christopher.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322279/#Comment_322279" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T12:53:10+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 12:53PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By Vincent Baker's post (which I had read before but hadn't fully assimilated, I guess) - "Choose whether you escape, recant, or burn" is a mechanic / mediating cue, not procedural.<br/><br/>"After your fifth experience point, mark improvement" - is more procedural. "Choose improvement from this list" - mediating cue.<br/><br/>But then I'm wrong about Fiasco / In a Wicked Age - oracles &amp; playsets - randomly choosing elements that go into the fiction, totally mediating / mechanical.<br/><br/>Universalis seems to me like it's almost entirely procedural by Vincent's definition. Character / element destruction from having all its traits removed is one of the few things that definitely specifies what happens in the fiction. And yet I don't think of Universalis as being freeform. I'm not saying Vincent's wrong, I'm just saying, "Huh. Interesting."<br/><br/>In my game, That's Drama, you can win a conflict either by putting down a card with a higher number (procedural) or putting down a card and narrating what's on it into the story (mediating).

It's important to act like procedures are just as binding as mechanics, too. Once, when I was playing Storming the Wizard's Tower, one of the players elected to make his character a drunk that lived down by the harbor.<br/>The GM very politely reminded him that the PCs need to be respected, or at least important, members of the community; they need to be people who will be listened to and who can reasonably expect the help of the community. If this procedure is not observed, it's possible that play can end up focusing a lot of time on convincing the community to hand over needed resources and, generally, for the community to accept the PCs as authoritative. Both those things go beyond what Storming is about. Procedures are play advice - they give context and advice on how to effectively use the mechanics as intended.<br/><br/>At the far end of the "procedures" spectrum is a game like Vampire: the Masquerade, Revised Edition. You sit down, make some characters, and then.. .what? No specific hatred towards White Wolf is intended, here - they were part of a more or less hobby-wide tendency to use dharma transmission (a little Zen humor there) to communicate how one should play games, run games, etc. It's fascinating to look back on our history and see how relatively recently some designer suggested, "Hey, maybe we should have play advice for our game, as if our game were distinct enough that it merits being played in a certain way."<br/>I know that this mindset, that all games only differ mechanically, not procedurally, was how I used to think, back when - there was this sense, not just felt by me, that one could someday find THE game, the game with the best mechanics, that could handle all our favorite genres correctly, and then we would not need to look for games anymore.<br/>It was this notion that games weren't meant to do different things from one another, but, inversely, they were all attempts to do one unclear thing correctly: make the "best" possible RP experience. Yes, White Wolf put out articles on tone and such, and D&amp;D3 had an essay near the front of the DMG about play styles, but that was about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322284/#Comment_322284" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T13:10:03+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  1:10PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Baker said:<br/>"Freeform" VS "non-freeform" means no mediating cues VS mediating cues.

You may have lots of procedures, though - in fact, you pretty definitely have at least some, otherwise you're my son on the playground playing his game of "Anything", which is basically just Calvinball.<br/><br/>Outside of the context of discussing freeform play, I think the distinction is less significant. Though, as said, it's a good way to talk about how group interactions make up the "real game" being played, and if a group is not changing their procedures, then they're playing the same game, regardless of what "system" they're playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322292/#Comment_322292" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T14:22:43+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  2:22PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Zac">@Zac</a> in Virginia.<br/><br/>I just cut and pasted what you said and emailed it to some of my friends, as a means of explaining why i play Indie Games more than not these days.<br/><br/>*applauds*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322300/#Comment_322300" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T16:32:22+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  4:32PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: graypawn</cite>I like what Jesse said, but i wonder if a good game (by explaining all of these elements on different levels) brings to light<i>how</i>your group is playing a game.

(Cause I'm pretty sure that's how my experience 20+ years ago played out.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322302/#Comment_322302" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T16:55:42+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  4:55PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say it doesnt matter, because the labels are arbitrary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322305/#Comment_322305" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T17:24:53+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  5:24PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing where I'm like "content, principles, procedural cues, and mediating cues," I stand by.

Thing is, those games didn't make the style explicit. We had to puzzle it out from clues and trial and error. It took a lot of effort, both in prep and at the table. I can say, from a lot of hard-won experience, that playing Vampire was not simply chargen + task resolution. There was so much more to it!<br/><br/>AW makes that style explicit (the way DitV does for a different style, or Burning Wheel does for another). To me, the explicit method is waaaay easier.

And I'm not alone. <br/><br/>My high school and college gaming groups were over recently looking through my game library\u2026 AW caught their eye (great cover) and 4 of them stopped hanging out with the rest of us to devour it! Then they all bought copies! One thing they kept saying, "this is exactly how I run Shadowrun, except it is part of the rules." <br/><br/>I noticed a trend a few months ago\u2026 some people got upset that AW tells you how to GM\u2026 and then different people were quick to point out that AW tells you how to GM AW, not how to be a good GM in general. Now I agree, AW tells you how to GM AW but that doesn't mean those GM techniques are not common, easily applied to other games, or already exist in other games. <br/><br/>Most of AW's GM advice mimics how my gaming groups growing up ran games. The only exception I see is how fragile NPCs are. We always looked at NPC through crosshairs but they were never as disposable as they are in AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322364/#Comment_322364" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T07:49:45+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  7:49AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you guys list, say, ten things that <i>AW</i> says to do that you did in the past?<br/><br/>This isn't as "proof" -- I believe you.

Personally, this wasn't much like the way I've run games previously but I know folks who ran games this way and, yeah, it's a pretty awesome set of techniques for a specific swath of play experiences (really, I would say, it works for the bulk of traditionally structured "adventure" RPGs).  As a player, I find games like Dogs, Mouse Guard, and AW super helpful, because I feel like I'm finally learning how to be a really effective GM, at least in a few specific styles, something that years of fucking around and reading "GM advice" books did not really help with.  And, as a designer, I think it's really great that we increasingly have the vocabulary and good examples for talking about play styles (not just GM, but player too) explicitly. Honestly, I think it could potentially lead to yet another renaissance in design and play.  It is a BIG DEAL.  Christopher, you should read AW right now if you're trying to write Play Sorcerer.  I mean, Vincent does pretty much the same thing you're trying to do for Ron's game, making how to play extremely explicit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322386/#Comment_322386" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T10:52:29+00:00" title="April 30, 2011 10:52AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2011 10:54AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, you're probably right about that. And I probably will read <i>Apocalypse World</i> during the lull between finishing the first, whole reader-ready draft and waiting for my readers to send back notes.<br/><br/>As for another renaissance in design and play, I agree. In fact, a few years ago, on the Forge, somewhere (I can't find a damned thing anymore) I said that this issue -- making clear <i>how</i> we play --  is the next issue that has to be addressed. <br/><br/>I want to add, I don't think this is just a matter of GM style. It's players-at-the-table-style. Everyone at the table is interacting with each other with ideas, and different ways of interacting are... well, different. With different effects.<br/><br/>The importance of so much of Vincent's game design work, in my view, is that he keeps some of the traditional properties of the Game Master (most importantly, for me is the Game Master being able to apply pressure to the Player Characters) but codifies and sets up the expectations of the pressure so things so don't go all crazy with the Players trying to guess which way they are supposed to jump, try to mind-read their way through the session, tip-toe around the Game Master's expectations, or fear breaking the fun for other people.<br/><br/>His design does a bunch of other stuff, of course. But this aspect, the Game Master applying pressure on the Characters in a codified manner without it becoming bullying against the Players, is really, really vital. There's so much of value in having a Game Master around to do that -- but now its really of value because the procedures of how to do that effectively are becoming more and more explicit. <br/><br/>As for the Players, when the Game Master's tools or whateverthefuck we're calling them are explicit and clear, they have a better idea how hard they can push with their characters without breaking the play experience. (And in these games like <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>In A Wicked Age..</i>., <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> and so on, they can push pretty fucking hard!) This, too, is really important for me. Being able to say to Players, "Go! Go! Go!" without people worrying they are going to break someone's fun or the group's play is crucial for me -- whether I'm a Game Master or Player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322390/#Comment_322390" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T11:33:46+00:00" title="April 30, 2011 11:33AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>AW codifies how I've always run games like Shadowrun, Star Wars, and many other games.</blockquote>\nDo you think my occasional disconnect with AW stems from having not played a particular branch of games?<br/><br/>Sometimes I feel like "OK, it says to do this thing, and I am doing it, but I'm doing it because it says to do it and I trust the rules."

The first is that it builds on Vincent's experiments (conducted around the same time as Poison'd, as I recall) that have to do with what the GM is socially "allowed" to do to players if they fail a roll (or allow a situation to come to fruition).  What feels fair. What feels like cheating, etc.  And that's codified pretty carefully in the MC moves. That's the thing you mention here, the "applying pressure" thing. The other is that it builds on his thoughts on <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=499" rel="nofollow">fictional positioning</a>, which has to do with what is and isn't a "move," how you can incrementally set things up, and some other things. When I read AW, those Anyway posts stand out pretty strongly as the foundations.<br/><br/><b>Jason:</b> Have you really never run any of the "second wave" RPGs that were after D&amp;D and Call of Cthulhu?  Ars Magicka, Shadowrun, Legend of the Five Rings, 7th Sea, all the White Wolf games, In Nomine, Exalted, Rifts and all the other Palladium games, Cyberpunk, Castle Falkenstein, Blue Planet, Earthdawn, most superhero games, etc.  In my mind, those are the classic Sim-Nar games that much of the Forge stuff was a reaction against, mostly because they were not explicit about what the games were about, what you were supposed to do in them, how they were supposed to be run and played.  They were all really setting-heavy and dripping with color and style, but light on specific instructions on what to actually do.  They were big into "storytelling" and giving the GM guidance on how to manage the players and get them to play along productively. They all promoted this sense that GMing skills were close to universal and easily transferable between one game and another, because most games were more or less the same. My sense is that AW gives explicit guidance for making that type of game really work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322400/#Comment_322400" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T12:36:02+00:00" title="April 30, 2011 12:36PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>At the far end of the "procedures" spectrum is a game like Vampire: the Masquerade, Revised Edition. You sit down, make some characters, and then.. .what? No specific hatred towards White Wolf is intended, here - they were part of a more or less hobby-wide tendency to use dharma transmission (a little Zen humor there) to communicate how one should play games, run games, etc. It's fascinating to look back on our history and see how relatively recently some designer suggested, "Hey, maybe we should have play advice for our game, as if our game were distinct enough that it merits being played in a certain way."</blockquote>\nDoesn't all the play advice in VtM exist? Am I just imagining all of it?  I distinctly remember everyone <i>making fun of</i> how much play advice Vampire had. Like, 'didn't these people know how to roleplay?' scoffed the hobby. Meanwhile Vampire brought in TONS of noobs who didn't know anything and learned to play from its suggestions, procedures, whatever you want to call them.<br/><br/>Anyway, for some reason AW seems to be super important to this thread, and I haven't read it closely, but what I did see appeared to be pretty normal stuff.

For a number of reasons, the latter approach works way better for me than the former approach, but surely there's people who prefer the former.  I just never felt like I was able to fully internalize and follow the play advice given in most other game texts or the things I learned from watching other GMs. Having the procedures spelled out explicitly -- in a way that I could easily look down and reference at the table -- did wonders for me.</blockquote>\nOh totally.

Literally, nothing on it at all.<br/><br/>The only other game that I have handy from this general tradition is Blue Rose.  Here's what it says (p. 180-181):<br/><br/><i>It helps to outline the structure of the society where the intrigue takes place... Ask a few simple questions: Which factions or persons wield power and influence? What resources do they have at their disposal? What do they want? Who are their allies and why? Who are their opponents and why? How far are they willing to go to accomplish their goals? ...Done right, this means that the players are interacting with a complex and believable game world with depth and meaning, a world that doesn't just exist for them but has a life of its own. On a more practical level, it also means that if the players suddenly decide to approach something from a completely surprising angle, you can easily determine what happens next.</i><br/><br/>Ring any bells? To me, that sounds pretty much like front/threat creation, make AW seem real, play to find out what happens, do what your prep demands, etc.  Of course, Blue Rose doesn't tell you HOW to actually do this (maybe in the Narrator's Guide, who knows?), but it definitely tells you that this is what you are supposed to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322437/#Comment_322437" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T17:31:37+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  5:31PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, Shadowrun didn't do anything that progressive. Compared to D&amp;D it dropped levels, made combat faster and more challenging, gave players incredible freedom in character design, streamlined some rules where that was sensible (lifestyle) but made other more important (social skill tests) sometimes where they weren't need (hacking, so many guns). What this meant was that you had to run it differently to get it to work, and when you worked out how to do that it started to look like AW. For example, when you asked "why are an Orc nature shaman, a street samurai and a shapeshifter running together?" you needed to work out something like Hx for this to make sense.<br/><br/>I'm with others that read AW (and Play Unsafe) and went "yes, this sets out everything that makes this type of game work in a single simple list!" In addition AW, and most story games, simplified the rules where complexity was not required.

You hang pouring over stories across time and culture long enough and you realize that novelty isn't particularly valuable--execution and clarity are what matters.)<br/><br/>So, Ron Edwards and others looks at Hero Wars, the same game that some people see as useless, and think, "Oh, this is great because if I use this game this way I get AWESOME." <br/><br/>What is that stuff that lets us have a point of view about play that transforms expectations of play. And how do we bring those things to the table on purpose?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322452/#Comment_322452" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T20:30:43+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  8:30PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing about many of these popular games in the 90s and early 2000s... a lot of the greatness isn't in the core books, so many people never see it.

Those were critical games. Especially, UA, for me. That was the game (after Vampire + CBN) that really blew my mind in terms of explaining how to use all those bits to produce a <i>specific kind of game</i> at the table. A game book that was explicit about its techniques and procdures, I guess. UA is another game whose GM is very much like an MC, too.<br/><br/>JD: Yeah, the core story in Shadowrun is totally clear. One of the best ever, really. But, as Jenskot says, the core book didn't do a very good job telling you how to bring that core story to life. "Go on shadowruns," is pretty weak, as techniques go. That said, the core story was so crystal clear, and exciting, we we highly motivated to figure it out and make it work for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322455/#Comment_322455" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T20:40:02+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  8:40PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, who here said that Shadowrun doesn't have a clear, core story that tells you what to do?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that hasn't been said.

You say you used to run CoC and Shadowrun the AW way ... But they had modules ... So how can that be the same thing?<br/>A D&amp;D module doesn't always look like a Vampire module which doesn't always look like a Shadowrun module. And just because Shadowrun has optional modules... doesn't mean you have to use modules to play. That said, Shadowrun has some of the most amazing modules I've ever seen. Including multiple hooks with options to customize them to your PC's backgrounds, and tools and content generators to improv huge chunks of the modules based on the assumptions the players will drive the action.<br/><br/>Additionally, several of Shadowrun's supplements (like the Shadowrun Companion) had lists of questions very similar to the questions you ask the players in your first session of Apocalypse World where you follow the characters around as they live their lives. Shadowrun also had extensive optional lifestyle rules and guidelines where you can make the fictional world you all create together feel real, and allow the players to drive the game.<br/><br/>I don't think Shadowrun is a great game system wise. I don't think it is even a great toolkit (the way D&amp;D 3E is). But a lot of its meandering and sometimes unsupported guidelines pointed to an AW play style. The best of the best Shadowrun GMs I've met were able to piece through the chaos and confusion through lots of work and practice to run amazing games the way AW runs right out of the box. Shadowrun is well intentioned with crappy execution. AW has similar intentions but with great execution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322460/#Comment_322460" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T21:25:07+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  9:25PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2011 9:25PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Jamie:</b> I don't know about the adventure writing for Shadowrun, but the adventure writing for In Nomine (which I think was derived from White Wolf stuff) came in basically 2 different varieties:<br/><br/>1) "Seeds": These were basically the premise of an arc worth of play, 2-5 sessions worth, written in a few paragraphs. Typically some dude was trying to do some thing and the players were called in to do something about it or had some vested interest in making sure things worked out a certain way.  They were the equivalent of "bangs," if you know that bit of Forge jargon.  Sometimes they included a statted up NPC or two or an artifact or something, but often they were purely descriptive, with the rest left for the GM to implement.<br/><br/>2) "Scenarios": These typically started with a "seed" or sometimes several seeds that would bring the characters together in different ways.  Then there would be a section describing the various factional interests that were in play, with stats for the important characters in each group.  Then there would be a list of locations or pre-set scenes that you would do stuff with when the characters decided to check out specific places or track down specific individuals.  More NPC stats, and often short descriptions of how the NPCs would react if the characters approached them in certain ways.  Inevitably, some of these interactions were assumed to lead into fights, and there was often a brief description on how the fight might go.  But, ideally, the scenario was set up to be relative open-ended, in a "play to find out what happens" way. The characters could do whatever they wanted, seek out whoever they liked, approach things in whatever order, etc.  The poorly written scenarios tended to have obvious linearity, where characters would probably go A -&gt; B -&gt; C, but the better ones were basically just like Fronts and Threats.<br/><br/>In both of these cases, the fact that there was written adventure material didn't really change the fact that you were basically supposed to run it like you run AW, more or less. The GM was ideally supposed to play all these interests but not have a story in mind so much, though there was definitely a tendency to railroad as well, in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322464/#Comment_322464" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T22:28:17+00:00" title="April 30, 2011 10:28PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2011 10:38PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie, I know this thread's moved beyond the original topic, but I just wanted to share a quick answer.

"I see the world in terms of spirits, not tech!")... and the fact that I was basically a hack for Mr. Jones getting paid well to rob microchips.<br/><br/>I'm not presuming that's what Jonathan was talking about, by the way. That's what I thought of when he meant. The game did explicitly tell you what to do -- "rob things" -- but how to incorporate all the cool setting stuff into that game was, for me, missing. <br/><br/>I'm referring to the core rules. John is saying the Shadowrun Companion opened this up a lot. But at that point I'm not sure I'd be making it about running for Mr. Jones anymore. By that point, I'd be tossing the core "this is what you do..."<br/><br/>With hindsight and new tools, I'd set up the game the way I'd set up the game for playing Glorantha with <i>HeroQuest</i>... start with a neighborhood, a community in the sprawl. The kind of place where folks of different backgrounds could meet up and form tenuous alliances, or at least have to deal with each other, because of proximity and daily contact. And I'd use the <i>HeroQuest</i> rules. This way, your character's culture and race were tied directly into the mechanics--which I think is awesome and taps all the setting stuff well. And I don't think the <i>Shadowrun</i> rules did well at all.<br/><br/>I'd let the Players set their own agendas, put pressure on the community as the Game Master, and let the Player Characters have cross-cutting or group adventures as needed. (Essentially using a Kicker/Bang structure from <i>Sorcerer</i> for play.) That would be saying farewell to the corporate sponsored shadowrunning as the core "action" of the game. The PCs might take jobs. Or they might rob on their own agenda. Or they might be working to keep that little elf girl down the street from joining the local gang. But whatever that agenda is wouldn't be "you work for shadowy corporations and criminals robbing other shadowy corporations and criminals, and go shopping."<br/><br/>Which is to say, I wanted to play the game "wrong" -- as you would say -- because when I read the game setting material playing wrong was the only thing that made sense to me.

It builds on the assumptions that this isn't something you chose to do. That the rich geo-political/socially rich setting has created shifts in the world that have put you, your friends, and your family into tough spots where you have to make major sacrifices. And it asks you, what lines aren't you willing to cross? It also delves into your life outside of Shadowrunning and shows that there may be something you care more about than just buying bigger guns. <br/><br/>Additionally, it gives you multiple options not to play "crooks working for 1 corp, stealing from another, and then going on shopping trips" or gives you the option to leave that world behind and switch to helping people, making change or breaking under the pressure of the world and joining extremely reactionary groups like eco-terrorists. Either way, it shakes things up and supports different play styles.<br/><br/>What I found frustrating\u2026 why isn't this in the core book? Why is it in a book that may come out a year or more after? Same thing with D&amp;D. The Player Handbook describes 1 game, and then the Dungeon Master Guide and later books describe different games, some that contradict what is in the Player Handbook. It seems some of these core games encourage you to play on one end, highly questionable people and on another extreme end\u2026 sociopaths! And then later books encourage you to play less questionable people.<br/><br/>I've spoken (and gamed with) several Shadowrun, Pathfinder, and D&amp;D freelancers and have asked many of them\u2026 why does this happen? The general answer is\u2026 this is the kind of play their core audience wants. This is what they want to pay money for. Granted this isn't want everyone wants. There is a minority of Shadowrun players, for example, that want to play a game that is more story focused with characters that seem like real people instead of characters that are more like video game avatars with little motivation whose primary use is to engage in no questions asked combat. They do release products for the perceived minority. But they don't tend to be the core books. But most people only read the core books. So that is what they game ends up being about for many people. <br/><br/>I wonder if this is the same logical trap of "mostly men buy our products so we will use titillating images of women to attract more men." Meanwhile, those images may help ensure more women won't play these games\u2026 and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322495/#Comment_322495" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T07:36:07+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  7:36AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2011 7:44AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I walked the hollowed halls of many game publisher in the early 90s.

It was totally unclear to me. Especially when a lot of the really cool story bits were things that happened way in the past, that the characters couldn't really interact with.

In fact, taking tokens away from a pool, advancing along a track, turning a die from 1 to 2 on the way to 20 or from 20 to 19 on the way to 1, or otherwise advancing a state variable ... all mechanically equivalent.<br/>So saying 'mediating cues' == 'mechanics' confuses me. I will hereby stop using the term mechanics when I mean mediating cues.<br/>I'm not crazy about the term 'mediating cues' - it sounds a bit pretentious to me, though it is accurate - anybody got something better? (As does "narrativism", so maybe that's just me.) <br/><br/>Here's a thing - if we accept my mechanics definition to apply to RPGs as well, then procedures are a <i>subset </i>of mechanics - and it's not a useful distinction for separating freeform from not.<br/><br/>What might be useful about my definition is it might help separate setting-agnostic games from setting games.  Universalis, Archipelago, Geiger Counter, Shock are almost all mechanic.<br/><br/>"If your unit falls below 0 hit-points, your unit cannot move or act until their hit points have been brought back above 0" - is a highly mechanical rule.<br/><br/>"If your character's hit points fall below 0, your character is unconscious, they cannot move or act until they've been restored to consciousness" - starts getting a little color, but not much - it would be trivial to transpose this mechanic to different color.<br/><br/>"If your character's hit points fall below 0, your deity will ask you to make a promise from the following list." - here's a mediating cue, and what's awesome about it is it nearly inextricably ties color to mechanics, and that's a reason story RPG's are so great, and why we need to keep making more and more of them.<br/><br/>And here's another thing - in boardgames and video games color matters very little to me. Color is very important to most people - Joe and Fred might both love different games that have the exact same mechanics but different color, and hate the other, because one's into fantasy but not science-fiction and vice-versa. But me, I usually quickly see through the color to the underlying mechanics, and it becomes a game about abstract relationships and math.<br/><br/>In story RPG's, there's no such thing as "just color." I could say my character is green, thinking its an irrelevant detail, but then later might say that my character is hiding in the grass, and suddenly the fact that he's green matters to the outcome. <br/>If it matters because you get a bonus to a roll, we've made it a mediating cue (maybe on the fly). Maybe the GM says "Okay, +2 to your hide check." That's called 'attaching mechanical weight', right? Universalis is a game about designing mediating cues on the-fly, about attaching mechanical weight to fictional details.<br/>If it matters because we all agree it matters, and the GM and other players say, "Yeah, the badguys don't see you," because they're respecting the fiction ...

Roleplaying is basically about this, so I guess there should be a term for it besides just "roleplaying", maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322547/#Comment_322547" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T14:37:49+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  2:37PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2011 2:38PM by J_Walton.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Jamie:</b> Vincent (and other folks) have been calling that "fictional positioning."

It was totally unclear to me. Especially when a lot of the really cool story bits were things that happened way in the past, that the characters couldn't really interact with. How did it relate to being feudal vampire lords and living off the blood and suffering of the serfs while playing an elaborate game of intrigue and searching for redemption through the various Roads?</blockquote>\nRight, absolutely.  A ton of that setting stuff seemed to not really be that relevant to play, even with the very broad "here's how you play this game" instructions. I mean, game fiction lines qualify here too, right?

As far as I'm concerned, the relevant difference between the terms is what most people on the internet hear when they're used.  To the extent that this isn't united, the terms are useless.  But in my experience, these are the usual meanings:<br/><br/><b>Mechanics:</b>formal fiction-resolution procedures that involve physical cues (dice, cards, etc.) or at least concrete game quantities (hit points, action points)<br/><br/><b>Procedures:</b>mandatory other "how to play" stuff that doesn't qualify as mechanics (scene framing rules, scenario creation rules)<br/><br/><b>Techniques:</b>anything not mandated by the game that is done to affect play (GM style, character voices, cutting scenes right after resolution, sharing the spotlight evenly)<br/><br/>Yeah, you could call "framing scenes by the rules" a mechanic or a technique if you wanted, but I think most people on S-G don't.</blockquote>\nThat makes good sense. Also, looking at it from the Big Model frame of mind, procedures, rules and mechanics, and informal things needed to play the game are all examples of techniques. Ephemera is their implementation in play. <br/><br/>I tend to nest procedure and mechanic when I talk about them. Procedures are any processes to follow in play, and mechanical procedures have particular, usually quantified aspects that are reproducible. For example, evertime I make a saving throw in D&amp;D 4e it will be done the same way for my character, with different input given based on what power was used for the attack on my character. In Primetime Adventures, the process of resolving a conflict is mechanical: number of cards based on screen presence, additional cards based thrown in based on who wants to use their fan mail points to do so, etc. <br/><br/>Other kinds of procedures that might be useful to distinguish would be guidelines (eg the GM has the power to introduce threats), principles (eg start each session with a stranger coming into town [see Vincent's discussion of this over at <a href="http://lumpley.com" rel="nofollow">anyway</a>]), narrative structures (eg the play within a play in Doubt that gets played out in parallel to the character's real lives), and probably tons of other things. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322554/#Comment_322554" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T15:01:37+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  3:01PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2011 3:02PM by J_Walton.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>JD:</b> Game fiction, ha!

What's compelling me? Who knows. Social contract mostly -- <i>we all agreed to play by X rules. </i> This is definitely the head space I'm in when I'm running AW: when a particular procedure is granted the imprimatur of "mechanic," there is, for me, one more step it has to pass through before it enters the fiction: Is this statement a "move?" Can I rationalize it into a "move?" Is some other "move" more-correct or, I don't know, less of a stretch to pack into an existing "move" (even under the cover of not naming the move)? Sometimes that validation step is no biggie, especially when I've really internalized any given game and its philosophical assumptions. Sometimes it's just a lot more work.<br/><br/>BW is packed with mechanized procedures as well (SYORTD, Let it Ride, Intent + Task), and there's the additional layer of democratized procedures as well (trait votes, setting creation, collaborative character building and Belief workshopping), which I think complicates rigorous analysis.<br/><br/>Lots and lots of mainstream RPGs have toyed with mechanizing stuff that was previously left to the discretion of a single player. In every case, and I think in the case of indie hippie games as well, it's really just a matter of shifting around authority: This thing that used to be in the purview of the GM's discretion (advancement awards, what to say next, when or how to grant a player speaking time) is now in the purview of The Rules, which we all agree to grant higher authority than any given player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322631/#Comment_322631" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-02T12:30:08+00:00" title="May  2, 2011 12:30PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2011 12:32PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily, I think it's hard to get on the same page using such general terms that have familiar meanings outside of gaming.

(Or<i>HeroQuest</i>?) And/or, more specifically, are you familiar with the brouhaha the ensued on its release 11 years ago?</blockquote>No.  My relevant background is numerous arguments about whether or not a given game was "broken".  Vampire the Masquerade is by far my best example.\n<blockquote>* I might mean what you mean by "taste." I'm not sure. Can you tell me more about what you mean by that word in this context?</blockquote>Sure.  In games that give you options for what to include in play, players will choose to include the stuff they like.  In Shadowrun, tastes could determine that a game be filled with lots of sneaking and negotiating, or be mostly combat.  That could make or break the game, depending on whether Shadowrun's rules best support sneaking, negotiating, or fighting.\n<blockquote>* Really? You would say that a game that requires dungeons is "broken"--even though you know that there are people who can design dungeons to work with the game perfectly well? You would blame the game and not a skill set you can compare to other people? I need to check: Really?</blockquote>The polite and assiduously accurate version: "I find this game to be too demanding, as it requires skills such as dungeoncraft which are auxiliary to the primary act of roleplay."  The quick and grumpy version: "This game is broken."<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever heard of a game that <i>everyone</i> thinks is broken.  It's just a matter of what outside skills the game requires and whether or not you have them.  If you suck at creating Bangs for your group and the Sorcerer text doesn't help you improve, then you could call Sorcerer broken, and to me that wouldn't sound much different than Ron calling Mutants and Masterminds broken because it gives no situation guidance.<br/><br/>I'm kinda playing devil's advocate here, and oversimplifying.  I think some games are more broken than others, but that usually comes down to complex combos of which skills they require, how common those skills are, how disparate those skills are, how much guidance is given, whether training is included, whether practice alone appears sufficient, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322685/#Comment_322685" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-02T17:51:05+00:00" title="May  2, 2011  5:51PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, thanks.
