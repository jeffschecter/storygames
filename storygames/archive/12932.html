Parentage has absolutely no effect on the race of the child in Shadowrun. You could have two human parents with an ork child, an elf and a dwarf with a human child, and so on. It's completely random. <br/><br/>This to me is awesome, because it's one of these classic science fiction "what if?" situations that gets you looking at race relations from a non-involved point of view, so you can take a look at it on several levels, starting at the character level. What if your parents were human and they have a feeling of human superiority because of their existence pre-2012, and you end up abandoned or treated poorly compared to your human sibling? What if you've got a pair of ork and dwarf parents who both experienced poor treatment and abandonment at the hands of their human parents, you're human and now have to deal with that resentment? Do cliques with racial purity crop up, wanting only members whose parents and grandparents are all of the same race? What effect does this have on human race relations? Are there problems still between human ethnicities or is it completely overshadowed? Do humans keep working the way they did before and do similar qualities develop for the other races, such as predictable skin colour? Do white parents produce white children regardless of the race, and the same for blacks and asians? <br/><br/>A lot of questions to ask, some probably answered by the GM and changing from campaign to campaign, and some consistent themes throughout. <br/><br/>There are also some other questions to ask, such as attitudes towards technology and the environment. Do people care about climate change anymore, or has magic made it irrelevant? Also, what about religions? There's some 3 billion people at least with faiths that would be strongly tested by the return of magic. What new religions crop up? What old ones return? What current ones survive?<br/><br/>The whole setting and concept is just ripe for years and years of adventures exploring human issues from quite alien points of view. They're issues that produce violent action even now, so having a combat focused system also remains quite appropriate - not choosing to fight becomes a much more meaningful choice if the characters are combat powerhouses and the system facilitates it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291391/#Comment_291391" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T10:16:05+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 10:16AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought that post-goblinization, when the magic level had steadied, race x + race x = race x?

They never really knew what they were going to get. Even after the kid was born, it might change to something else. All the other races were basically fixed. And, once the initial wave of goblinization hit, humans could rest a bit easier as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more interesting thing about race in Shadowrun, to me, is that orks will <i>very clearly</i> become the dominant race on the planet within a couple hundred years, even if the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://wiki.dumpshock.com/index.php/File:ChartWorldPop2.gif" rel="nofollow">population numbers I ran over a decade ago</a> are a bit off.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the questions you ask, particularly those surrounding race-based politics and action, do indeed make fairly prominent appearances in Shadowrun from time to time. Your questions also make good fuel for the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=402.0" rel="nofollow">Shadowrun/Apocalypse World hack</a> I am pondering.<br/>\n<br/>\n{/Shadowrun historian mode}<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, don't let that spoil your fun. It's easy to imagine some setting where race is a surprise to parents, and build something cool from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291419/#Comment_291419" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T11:19:18+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 11:19AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I happen to own a Shadowrun 4th Edition PDF, which has this to say on this topic under the "Metahumanity" section:<br><br>"Humans are no longer alone\u2014they are just one of the five major subspecies of Homo sapiens. Known collectively as meta- humanity, each of the five metatypes\u2014dwarf, elf, human, ork, and troll\u2014are more or less evenly distributed across the globe in geographic and ethnic terms. Though humans retain the majority, each of the others comprises a significant percentage of the worldwide population<br>The first metatypes to appear were dwarfs and elves born during the first wave of UGE (Unexpected Genetic Expression) in 2011. Orks and trolls appeared ten years later, during the period of \u201cGoblinization,\u201d when many humans suddenly transformed. Now a half century past the Awakening, goblinization is exceedingly rare, occurring only to humans, usually during puberty.<br><br>"In 2070, most metahumans are born to parents of the same metatype. In the case of mixed parents, the child has a roughly even chance of being born as the metatype of either the father or the mother. There are no \u201chalf breeds\u201d in the Sixth World\u2014no elf- orks or dwarf-trolls, no matter how amusing the concept may be."<br><br>But despite it not being exactly the way you remember, Robin, I think your post is actually very correct in the theme that Shadowrun really is an awesome setting. It's like an old movie begging for a remake with modern technology.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
