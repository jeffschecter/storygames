And in my usual fasion I blurted out that I think this is a mistake. And now I have to make a thread to explain why. I've done this before, elsewhere (maybe even here) but it's not the kind of thing that's easy to look up (I shoulda made it a Standard Rant the first time). At this late date, I'm not even sure that there's much reason to recapitulate this - apologies to those who've seen it many times already -  but in case it's interesting or beneficial, here goes:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy argument comes in two parts:<br/>\n<br/>\n - Party Play is Problematic -<br/>\nNo, not for everyone. But I think it is for most "story game" play, if you will. In fact this explanation is really somewhat senseless in point of view that many (most?) story-games these days do away with the party concept well and good. But why is it a problem? <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically it frequently creates a conflict of interests for a player. The player is told that it's a RPG, and that he should feel free to explore the things that he finds interesting with his character. Now, of course, it's a collaborative medium, so he'll probably have to mold his inputs around those of other players (GM especially, if there is one). Otherwise it might as well be a solo activity. It's true of RPGs, however, that everyone's fun is increased by the collaboration. Or at least that's the idea. So we assume that the player will have to constrain his character's actions down from "Anything" to, "whatever is fun in response to what the other player are doing." <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, the raison d'etra for party play is to constrain players so that they don't "split up the party." The thought being that if/when this happens, that other players are left on the sidelines uninterested. We'll get back to that in a moment. The problem, however, is that it asks the player to do this by simply asking the player to include his character in every scene. In practice, in fact, there's often no ratonale given for why a particular character is in a scene, other than that he's part of the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, on it's own, is ridiculous, but there are easy fixes. We assume, for instance, that the party is on some sort of mission. Or that they're even a team of some sort that do things together. <br/>\n<br/>\nFine. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut... give me one example of a form of fiction in which the only scenes the main characters have are together? Oh, it might happen as the random result of the plot, but in most cases the "party" in fiction gets split up. Basically the author is exploring something about the character that requires that the character go do X. And X is simply not somthing that it makes sense for the other characters to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike going on a date with an NPC. With party play, you either simply do not have scenes like this, or you actually *do* split up the party. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while for tactical play of non-story-games, this may be fine, for some genres, for story-games it's just anathema. Oh, sure, exceptions will abound in terms of tight games like The Mountain Witch. But that's a pre-condition of play, that play is only going to be about that party's one exploit. In fact, most games in which party play is considered the norm, are not this way, and there's this theoretical notion that a player can and should go and explore things about their character. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... basically the problem is that the player is being told that he should both constrain his options to always coming up with some idea of why his character is going along with the party, in whatever they're doing. And that's just going to conflict with how the player wants to explore his character sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I'm not talking about greedy play where one player wants to go off and grab all the attention for himself. Let's give an example. Jim is playing a barbarian. He's made a big deal of how his character is deathly afraid of bird magic. The party decides that they're going to go to the Temple of the Big Magic Bird. What are Jim's options?<br/>\n<br/>\n - Forget his character motivations, and just go along. <br/>\n - Decide to not go along, breaking the agreement to do party play.<br/>\n - Concoct some roleplaying moment where his character is "convinced" to go. This is work, rarely fun, and it's not really creative, because we all know what the outcome is going to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of these are good options. Given four well-characterized characters, there quite simply are going to be moments where party play means that somebody is not getting to play their character in a way that they find fun. I think that most people have encountered this, and that it's not all that controversial. But we'll see. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134436/#Comment_134436" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T13:32:56+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:32PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\n - Another Method Exists - <br/>\nSo, Mike, if we get rid of party play, how do we organize play? How do we make sure that everyone stays engaged in play? If they're not getting to roll dice, they're going to go off and watch TV, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative is what I and some others call "Scene Play." It starts with the assumption that action does not simply organically flow from one moment to the next, but that the players and GM are actively "cutting" scenes, and moving on to others. This allows you to pack a lot of drama into a relatively very short time. No, without scene play, you do need something like Party play to keep players on their toes. But doing good "scene framing"... getting to the action, and then getting out... is critical. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, basically, to answer the obvious question, no, not every player is in every scene (what, you were expecting some magical answer?) So, doesn't that mean that the other players will be bored?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell what a lot of people do at this point is point out other ways in which the players can actually remain involved in play (like playing NPCs). And while these are good things to mention, they're quite simply unneccessary. If you frame back and forth between players each taking their scenes, several things happen:<br/>\n<br/>\n - Players are alert because it's not going to be hours until their scene, but maybe just a few minutes. <br/>\n - Players find themselves actively becoming "audience." Meaning that, knowing that their character is not meant to be in this scene intentionally, they can shift gears, and take a breather. And suddenly they find themselves able to get into what's going on, as if they were watching a TV show...<br/>\n - But it's a TV show where they can actually be heard shouting at the screen. This is key. Whatever other form of interaction you do or do not allow, you must allow feedback. Applause or laughs are unstoppable anyhow, but you want to get players to shout things out, even interrupt, or even suggest actions for he other players. It's collaborative for them, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Party play is often combined with "Shhh, you're not there, you can't talk" limitations. Which are bunk. Players can and will separate player and character knowledge appropriately. Its not a tactical game, anyhow, so there's no "cheating" involved. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on, but this is the basic technique. Let players understand up front that they will be taking "turns" doing scenes. Expecting this, play becomes no different than any boardgame where you have to wait your turn. Better, because you actually are actively engaged in abosrbing the story created by the other players as audience. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat ends up happening, a lot, is that players try to "horn in" on each other's scenes. Not in a malicious way, but they try to figure out motives for their characters that, in fact, *do make sense* for why they would be together. In the case of our superstitious barbarian, the barbarian player says, "How about if we do a scene before you go where you try to convince him to come." Understanding that the outcome is unclear, and it could go either way, and the players really do get to be creative in that scene.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nParty play is good for tactical games in which the fun is each player competing against the game to do their best, and where theme creation is not important to the players. It means maximal opportunity to make those sorts of decisions. For thematic play, however, scene play is critical, because this is what allows for appropriate player freedom of expression in creating themes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134439/#Comment_134439" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T13:39:17+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:39PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok.

With the exception of purely tactical dungeon-crawls, just about every modern D&amp;D game I've been in has involved "splitting the party" to some degree or another.<br/><br/>I think there's more to party-based play than just having everyone in the same scene together. It's more about group members applying their various talents towards achieving a group goal, with all of the opposition coming from sources external to the group. There's nothing about that in itself that prevents Scene Play; where the problem comes in is that party-based games are often also combat centered traditional games where the system <i>requires</i> everyone in the party to fight together so they don't get their asses handed to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134448/#Comment_134448" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T13:59:10+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:59PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The above version is very shortened from longer versions, so I'm sure some things aren't as clear as I intended.

And you get long periods where the characters are, in effect, a party. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I agree with you. Another way to look at my entire point is that what I'm looking for is to have scene play available so that the players don't have to always do party play... when agreeing to go along on the adventure or whatever just doesn't make sense for their characters. Terminology aside, what's superior is having scenes where many characters are in the same scene, or when you can even have as few as one.

For me, it adds a lot to interact with the other characters rather than having the players kibbitz on an out-of-character level.  So I try to find ways to keep the PCs together and interacting with each other.  <br/><br/>It's not like I never try splitting the party -- it happens pretty frequently, and thus I have experience trying this out, with or without aggressive scene framing.  However, my experience has been that when everyone is together and can interact, it has usually been more fun.  This has been just as true in indie story games as in more traditional games.  For example, we recently discussed this issue in my Burning Wheel group, and we agreed that we would like to bring the PCs together more often.  <br/><br/>While in principle players can interact in-character through playing NPCs, the transfer is usually tricky and the NPCs are generally not well developed.  For this reason, I also try to limit the number of NPCs that the PCs interact with -- i.e. preferring to have a known NPC fulfill a given function rather than making up a new NPC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134461/#Comment_134461" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T14:20:14+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  2:20PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Basically there's pressure to ignore your character's motives, or modify them, or work around them all in the name of having every character in every scene.

It seems to me to be saying the same thing: you try to draw PCs together where plausible, but sometimes there are good reasons for them to be apart.  <br/><br/>Obviously there is a spectrum between PCs always apart on the one hand, and PCs always together on the other.  I don't see a clear dividing line.  Now, it could be that someone prefers a different point on the spectrum.  However, the drive to have PCs together isn't necessarily mindless adherence to tradition -- it is often preference arising from play, like mine.  That is, they have tried games where the PCs were more split up, and found they preferred to pull the PCs together more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134573/#Comment_134573" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T08:33:24+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  8:33AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's weird about it is that I think it makes a difference which direction you come at it from, even if you end up in the same place.

I suspect the main difference here is that your view of "party play" philosophy is different than mine.  <br/><br/>More generally, I think the contrast of "Party Play" and "Scene Play" is a false dichotomy.  You can have both scenes and a party.

We've had to take active steps to reintroduce party-play, and I think we are doing this because we WANT party-play for the reasons discussed above (the regular interaction of a small group of regular characters).<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note one way to sorta do this to have every player with multiple characters, and then try to have every scene draw upon at least one character from each player's pool. This allows every player to have a character in every scene. The drawbacks of this are it can still be one separate story for each protagonist, and that the number of characters can get very large, as many as number of players squared, giving each individual character less and less screen time. Whether this technique counts as "party play" depends, as others have said, on one's definition of party play. I think as a functional matter this method is unacceptable - there just isn't enough time to fully develop a dozen different characters)<br/>\n<br/>\nA few techniques so far:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. We've reshuffled which characters are protagonists and which are minor moon characters after the first session. Boring protagonists get turned into minor characters or dropped; the really spunky squire with a close relationship to one of the other protagonists who was merely a sidekick played by a moon gets elevated to protagonist.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Abandon the idea that the Mistaken plays "Demons" and instead have the mistaken play characters that are highly likely to drive the heart's protagonists story arc. For example, we had two protagonists, one highly corrupt with a rough expected story arc of redemption, the other higher naive and innocent with a rough expected story arc of corruption. Have the heart of one be the mistaken for the other. Typically both characters will be in every scene of the other, as the corrupt character tempts the pure one, and the pure one reminds the corrupt one of the "Good old days"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134619/#Comment_134619" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T12:20:03+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 12:20PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're having a semantic problem here. I thought I cleared it up with Thor's post. But let me try again:<br>\n<br>\nMy perspective is that scene play is both:<br>\n<br>\n1. Scenes with some of the characters, and<br>\n2. Scenes with all of the characters. <br>\n<br>\nIf you want to see scenes with some of the characters as scene play, and any scene with all characters as party play, OK, fine. Then Party Play is awesome. But it's awesome as part of an overall model where it's not made a requirement. Or even a model where undue pressure is put on players to Party Up. <br>\n<br/>\nAgain, that might be a better perspective on all of this. Rather than talking about a certain style of play, we can talk about whether or not there are assumptions going on in play that are creating pressures that are forcing players into a conflict of interest between playing to their character's motivations, and playing to ensure some sort of ability to interact on a constant basis. Since that's not neccessary. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that all said, I think that my original perspective has some advantages to it in terms of the fact that it also addresses the techniques that make "split-party" play (if you will) more palatable. That is, actually doing scenes and cutting and such is important to this. For instance, if a player manages to protract his "solo" scene on by narrating, "OK, now Ragnar leaves the tavern and goes next door to the blade merchant to buy a new sword" that's a bad thing. Part of the typical mode of play that includes scene play is that there is little in the way of conscious framing, and more a sense of continuing action. Which means that player priorities are being ignored for a sense of continuity. And one that doesn't make sense, either, since the question arises: what are the other characters doing while Ragnar is getting his new sword?<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew it would be controversial to call this "moving on." But for story games, I really think that it's important to adopt scene play assumptions - or something as powerful, I don't know what - in order to organize play. Note, again, that I'm under the assumption that, in fact, many or most people here already do scene play. So, from my perspective, if Thor says, "Well our party play is good," to me he's saying, "Well our scene play is good, especially when everybody is in the same scenes over and over." <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for whether or not the game referenced creates party play through suggesting that players adopt a team paradigm, no, it doesn't. My contention was that I assumed that the design in question was doing so under the assumption that this would make party play easier to deal with (and it would.) My point is that it's unneccessarily limiting to suggest this to players, because an alternative to party play exists. Hence why I asked the designer if he thought that his design specifically was good for team play. If he has another motive for suggesting team play, then great!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, I posted this here because the author in question asked me to discuss the method that made the team concept unneccessary. As I didn't want to clutter that thread with this discussion. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134620/#Comment_134620" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T12:23:19+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 12:23PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2008 12:31PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following the above post of mine with this...<br/>\n<br/>\nWilliam, yes. I am as against play that creates non-interacting stories as I am against play that dilutes story in the name of forcing players to have interaction available. I assume that the players will want to have scenes where  their characters interact with other players' characters. If the design disincentivizes this in any way, it's definitely bad. And it's good if the rules actually incentivize players getting together. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm against are social contract assumptions that do not really give the player the option to make that decision, but instead leave the player feeling bad no matter which decision he makes. <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn, you can deny that such exists, but then maybe you haven't experienced as much of the phenomenon as I have. For instance in my HQ IRC game, I once had a player do something very bizzare with her character, very against her character's nature. I thought she was just trying to be a bit avant guard, or, perhaps, simply hadn't realized how odd the act was to us (sometimes you miss context as a player). When I asked her, however, she said that she had done it to keep the party together. She said she assumed that I wanted her to do it, because she couldn't see how things could continue if the party got broken up over a large geographical distance. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was taken aback. I'd like to think that I go out of my way to indicate to players that it's fine to have characters go their own way. But what I had failed to convey, and this is important, is that just as easy as it is to split characters up, it's just as easy to contrive plot devices to get them back together again. No, not the player having to make some unrealistic choice about their character to get this to happen, but just some event that causes play to come together again. Sometimes this includes leaping forward considerably in time. If the players want to get back together, and this is the way to make it plausible, then that's a great way to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's just not commonly used technique. My fault for not making these things more obvious. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm talking about is empowering players to drive the story in the direction that they feel is most interesting by not falling back on traditional assumptions of how play works that would make this difficult. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134622/#Comment_134622" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T12:25:53+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 12:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can get behind that, Mike.

Turns out that I run things pretty much always in Scene Play mode, but in the initial game setup ("Situation Creation") I gravitate, like as in "the motherfucking primal force of gravity" towards situations where the players take on protagonists or anchors who:<br/><br/>1) Have a tight story reason to be together more times than not.<br/>2) Have a reason to work together more times than not.<br/><br/>This way, not everyone has to be in every scene. You can get cool character drama, talking in character, etc without having all the heads together all the time. But this method of play means that the characters are together more often than they are not (if not everyone in one scene, then at least a majority of them in one scene). It also means that there aren't often antagonists; or if they are, they are such that they can still be with the others regularly without jumping to "I kill you/you kill me" scenario.<br/><br/>Examples: L5R game: 3 players: 2 are samurai in the same clan and related (one a samurai and one a samurai-wizard), and a samurai from another clan. They have been sent to guard a wall. They split up all the time, but there are also many scenes where 2 of them are together, if not all 3.<br/><br/>Unknown Armies: All the 5 PCs are friends of "Erik Brassey", who has suddenly disappeared. They all have their own motivations and things they do, and yet many scenes there are 2-3 or more of them together.<br/><br/>Tenra Bansho: 4 ninjas and a samurai tasked (by different agents) to kill an evil warlord: They all work for the same clan. One will betray the others, but not for some time. They all have different skills and stories, and again we see many scenes where 3 of them are in one scene, and a scant few where all 5 are in the same scene.<br/><br/>I've played games where the players take characters who have little reason to be together (because of the situation), but that's not been too fun for me. In longer scenes where every character is in their own scenes by themselves, even if you bring in the other players to play NPCs, it still feels like it's too much downtime.

In Polaris I think it's less of the system ENCOURAGING split parties, but more of a failure to do anything to remind players they now have to make an active effort to keep party together. The way scene framing responsibility gets handed out might be part of the problem too however. For example, I've seen cases like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer A: ... and so it was. Wow, that was a great scene. I have an idea for a followup scene for my character, but someone else should take a turn. Anyone have any ideas?<br/>\n*silence or kibitizing about lame ideas for 45 seconds*<br/>\nPlayer B: Hmm, I have an idea involving my character and his cousin [a minor moon character]<br/>\nPlayer A: (Thinks - hmm, well I'm not in this scene, but I could use a break, and I don't want to wait any longer) Sure, sounds great!<br/>\n[play scene]<br/>\nPlayer A: And so it was.<br/>\nPlayer B: Great scene! Hey let's do that followup scene idea that I had that we delayed on.<br/>\nPlayer A: Does it include my character?<br/>\nPlayer B: Hmm, no, not really...<br/>\nPlayer A: That's cool. I need a break anyway.<br/>\nPlayer B: kk.

I gave the example of The Mountain Witch, saying that it's a case where players are agreeing to limit play up front to everyone always being together. And this is what JD is saying. <br>\n<br>\nLet me try yet another perspective. Let's say that you have a player like myself, playing in a game of D&amp;D. Planescape, let's say. In my actual case, the GM said, "Make up whatever you want" for a character. So I made up a hobgoblin fighter/priest. Came up with four pages of background. Developed an entire religion. <br>\n<br>\nSo when he was asked to help some elves, he had reservations. He didn't want to go along. It didn't make any sense with his background. But the mode of play was such that I was simply supposed to go along. It was made quite clear that by playing my character's personality, I was being difficult.<br>\n<br>\nNow... maybe that was my fault. <br>\n<br>\nThat is, maybe I wasn't playing D&amp;D like it's supposed to be played. I mean Planescape sure seemed to offer me the chance to characterize my character, but there was nothing telling me I was supposed to develop the characterization that I did. So, OK, my bad, I was not playing in the mode that the group preferrred.<br>\n<br>\nBut, OK, move forward several years, and I still see people playing with this "party" assumption. While at the same time claiming to want the game to be all about "roleplaying." And I'm still having a shitty time, because they're expecting me to bend my character concept out of shape just so that we can have the characters all together most of the time, and follow the GM's pre-planned plot. Often the cause for the need. <br>\n<br>\nI'm still not getting to scratch my itch to play my character the way I'd like, despite being told that this is actually an expectation of play. I'm constantly either being forced to make certain decisions about my character, or being considered an obstructionist player. <br>\n<br>\nNow I can't blame these folks, nobody ever showed them another way to play. Heck, that's how I ran games for two decades. I can say with great certainty looking back on play of my RPGs that I lost as players my two best friends, because I can tell that they really wanted to have creative control of their characters, but couldn't because they had to stay with the party so that I could run them through my plots. I didn't understand the problem at the time, or how to fix it. Surely I couldn't let those PCs go off on their own, and do what they wanted... what would I have them do? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know how to handle this. I have a method of play that solves the problem. My fears weren't unfounded... sans a method, the game would have stunk if I just let everyone go willy-nilly all over with no direction. But understanding how scene play works, this solves the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that an important part to scene play, to me at least, is Bangs. I didn't want to get into that in the essay, but bangs, and methods to come up with them, are what makes this sort of play entertaining enough to keep other's attention. If, in fact, the scene is Ragnar buying a new sword, people will fall asleep. And rightly so. It's only interesting to the player of Ragnar, if at all. But if that sword should happen to be recognized as the one that was used to slay his father? Now we're cooking with gas!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, I'm not suggesting that there aren't other cures, too. Just that they do exist, such that we don't have to fall back on agreeing to play as a team as the ONLY way to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Like I said, William, completely agree. System or technique has to come into play here to fix things. I prefer system, but I've got good techniques ready where system doesn't do this. See Ron's stuff in Sorcerer and Sex for some really interesting ideas on this.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134710/#Comment_134710" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T15:55:57+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  3:55PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see the benefit of "party concept" as being long term cohesion (explaining why these characters continue to cooperate and be found crossing paths over and over) more that "all together now" in scenes.<br/><br/>Assuming campaign play of inter-connected or episodic stories, to keep the same characters interested in the same overall story, never mind in scene, requires some level of broad agreement or specific agreement on areas of character interest.  Minimally, for example, if play is not to be "player vs player" a broad consensus on "well we're all opposed to the Great Old Ones and the Nazi's, right?"<br/><br/>I think you may, the tighter the definition of party and its theme becomes, have to be prepared for the story to become more "the party's story" than the story of individual characters.  It is the story of the House, of the Platoon etc. as much or more as of individual characters.<br/><br/>The alternative to "party" concept is a less restrictive, but likely more labour intensive, process of character creation that ensures lack of fundamental conflicts, goals that would put them on different sides of the major issues (assuming game is intended to be PCs vs NPCs), aspects that would make it implausible/a violation of any character's concept for them to cooperate with another character etc.  I believe there is frequent reporting of wasted time, table conflicts, unfun play when there is insufficient attention to such issues through some mechanic.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134713/#Comment_134713" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T16:28:10+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  4:28PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>If you're at the same place making more-or-less the same decisions, it seems to me like splitting hairs.

I suspect the main difference here is that your view of "party play" philosophy is different than mine.</blockquote>\nI'm trying to say that the sorts of goals that are pursued are different, even though the party is together the same amount.  In a game with a "party play" expectation, those goals are generally more party centric.  In a "scene play" game, those goals are generally more character centric.  I think you can vary that axis without affecting how many people are in each scene.\n<blockquote>More generally, I think the contrast of "Party Play" and "Scene Play" is a false dichotomy.

Party play is something that people do because they like it, and they've developed all kinds of strategies and tricks to help them like it MORE.  It's practically the poster child for a highly evolved, robust, "successful" play style.<br/><br/>What I'd like to hear more about is how a "split play" game works, and tricks to improve it.

At the simplest, that could simply be dispensing with the idea that if your character ain't there, you don't get to participate as a player in terms of advice and so on. I'm pretty sure Vincent Baker talked about this ages ago.<br/><br/>Further along, there's stuff like Paranoia XP's perversity point spending that I mentioned above. In this case, the players can spend a resource to act as a modifier to another player's charactre's chance of success, for good or ill, regardless of whether they have a  character in the scene/location. <br/><br/>The Hot War game I played recently had a similar mechanic for it's background "experience scenes". Thes were small vignette type scenes focusing on a single character, but when Res came up, other players could choose to add to the die pool of the active character or the opposition.<br/><br/>( This actually worked out to be some of the best scenes in the game. I wish all scenes' Res worked this way)<br/><br/>You could probably take it even further. If a player can offer suggestions to another character-player, why not offer them to a GM? Stakes-setting type games might work really well with this concept. It could also help spread results away from the binary stakes I see in some games I've played into multiple possible outcomes.<br/><br/>Sorry- breath- <br/><br/>Anyway, the point is to keep players engaged with the activity even when the party is split. Quick cuts simply reduce the time apart ( and can provide breathers), but that's only limiting the problem, not aiding in engagement. Also, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> be a more acceptable/less annoying form of metagaming for the immersionists. I dunno about that for sure, but since their own character is not involved, metagame rules wouldn't be intersacting negatively with their immersion fun at that particular point in time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134740/#Comment_134740" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T19:12:15+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  7:12PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking as a pro-immersion guy that has been experimenting with hippy games lately, doing metagame stuff when my character isn't present or playing different characters in different scenes is MUCH more bearable than forcing the character to be in every scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think longer scenes are better for deeper levels of immersion, all else held equal, but rotating scenes is a pretty reasonable compromise, at least in my experience. In a way, having 4 hour sessions with no break in the action is kinda like having one giant scene; breaking it up into 8 30 minute scenes works OK. I've even thought about, and I've seen some other deep immersions consider using the broken-up scene method as a way to frontload metagaming (you do all the metagame system elements and communication "The last scene went well/poorly because...

Yes, in fact the model I espouse really is more labor intensive. It's much easier to simply say, "Everybody, stay together... come up with a reason. Don't make me come up with a reason." And, heck, I'm a lazy GM, so I love solutions like this. And, again, again, again, if the group consciously chooses party play for this and makes it clear that this is the case, and everybody agrees that this is what they want to play, then great. No problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me clarify some history here. This is labeled as a "Standard Rant" because it's one of a series of articles that I've written, essentially. The others are posted on the Forge. And I usually qualify them with a disclaimer that explains the purpose. I'll do so belatedly here:<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically these are ideas that I keep coming back to, over and over. They may be slightly controversial, but the "Rantiness" in them is more about the fact that they're something I keep harping on, rather than they being truely complaining in tone. Perhaps that's bad labeling. But the point of these is to have some single thread that I can easily search up, and point somebody to, if/when the subject comes up again. I only do them when I become certain that It'll be less effort to do this once well than to do it many times not as well in different threads. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not saying I don't want to debate the point. But simply that the point doesn't have to be really controversial, despite the title. I don't have anything against party play, if it's what people want to do, or part of the design. I'm just suggesting that there's no reason to limit oneself to this sort of play to accomplish the "long-term cohesion" goal. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have another method. Is it more labor intensive? Yes. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, no. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's all part of an overall model that, in fact, can be quite easy. In fact, I've adopted it because, again, I'm lazy. That is, if it actually were easier to do party play all the time, I'd probably still be doing party play. But it's not. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there is, in fact, some additional effort involved in creating situations that keep play centralized. Far more than just saying, "Stay together, everybody!" But it's not a lot of effort. Far more is not "lots." It's pretty easy, and a lot of fun, too. Moreover, once you've got a centralizing concept, play prep becomes very, very easy, I find. In fact, I rarely do any once a game is up and running well. Crafted properly, I find that games like this become almost self-sustaining, requiring just normal GM maintainence in play. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in fact, I play this way because with my hectic life, I don't have time to do long prep. The small investment up front means that, long-term, I have to do less work. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said... there's something else at work here. If by "long-term continuity" you mean continuing the game at all costs? Well, then I have to agree with you that party play is superior. But I'd also argue that this is another tradition that has little purpose. We want to play these characters indefinitely? If your game is "permanent" and it's a tactical hobby, where each week is just a new scenario for the characters to get through, sure, I buy this. Party play is great, you're probably treating your character like a pawn most of the time anyhow. No conflict. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if the idea of play is to create stories, you're left with one of two models to follow:<br/>\n1. Soap Opera. Yeah, some "stories" go on indefinitely, it's true. I'm actually somewhat of a fan of this sort of thing. To get this to work, however, requires that the story be "refreshed" occasionally, with an injection of something new. Otherwise you just end up recapitulating the same story over and over, and there's really no creativity involved. If you want to do this sort of thing, then, yeah, once in a while you have to do that "set-up" work again with my model, to keep things new. But, again, as an overall model, this is less work than having to prep scenarios every week. Effort, yes. More than party play requires. But less than the overall models involved require. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Novels. Again, I often think that party play is adopted, because people automatically also adopt the idea that the game is "open-ended." What if, instead, we plan to cease playing with the characters at some point after a we've reached a climax? Isn't that a completely valid way to approach a story? Must we always keep playing the same characters? <br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere in between, too, is what I do most often, where I have story-lines come to a close, and then give players the option to do "Sequels" essentially. Where some of the characters may come back, but aren't required to do so. If we decide to do so, then, again, we're just setting up a new game, and, yes, we'll need to create a new centralizing concept again. But, again, that work will pay for itself many times over. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext I respond to Accounting with more specifics...                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134818/#Comment_134818" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T07:32:45+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  7:32AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Accounting, <br/>\nGiven the explanation above about the nature of the post, we're in agreement, no? That is, this thread may have been better off with the title you give it. That's certainly the idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I do think that there's a potential for dysfunction that I've identified. But it mostly has to do with players like me, running up against more traditional games. Or confusing portrayal of priorities. Nothing automatically problematic with party play itself. I'm less against party play, than I am agaisnt assuming that there are no other options. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if we can get past the slant, your question is how to do these things better? Well there's a whole body of technique that's involved, and each technique can be a long discussion itself. I didn't want to include all of that in the original article, but let's dig deeper here, sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I'll address one technique that I don't think is very good:<br/>\n - Playing NPCs or Troup-Style Play - <br/>\nI agree with David that this isn't a great solution. I will always let a player play an NPC if they are interested. Yes. But what I don't do is to count on this as a way to keep players engaged with play. It'll keep them *involved* with play, sure. But if that involvement seems like work, because the character in question does not interest them (either as character or as tool), then this can even be worse than boredom. Having a player be *engaged* by what's going on in scenes in which they are not present is the key. Entertained, perhaps. The scene draws them in by being somthing that they're interested in. How do we engage? <br/>\n<br/>\n - Player Approval of Characters - <br/>\nMight seem contradictory to the idea of player freedom, but these are collaborative games, again, and we're accepting that we want some limits. So at the very least, before play, have the players discuss their character ideas with each other. If the character idea interests only the player proposing it, but the other players don't seem interested, then have them try again. No, the other players don't have to be as interested in the character as the player of it is. But they should potentially be interested in where such a character's story goes. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if a player makes a despicable character, another player might not really want a story that focuses on those sorts of themes. Remember, when he's not in a scene, he's audience, and we want to make a "show" that he's going to enjoy watching. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo that extent, players should be supported by the system in making interesting characters, or at the very least exhorted to come up with characters who have some real story potential to them (without being created "played out.") Methods for this could fill an entire new thread. But the very simple key is player-to-player communication during character generation. In fact, this is often how a centralized concept develops like a team. From players agreeing that this is what they want to play. It's fine for this to develop organically like this (it also doesn't mean that you have to avoid split play). <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing these methods, the selection of characters is going to inform the entire direction that play takes. Make sure everyone is happy with it before moving on. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Centralizing Concepts - <br/>\nOK, you've got characters. And hypothetically in this case, the players haven't come up with any team concept, or other sort of link between the characters that'll create any reason for them to have scenes together. Do we just start play, and hope that the stories will collide? No. There are a few techniques that one can use to keep a group of characters intersecting. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne popular one these days is the "Central Conflict." First named such by Chris Chinn. In this case, the group looks at the characters in question, and then at the game world, and finds some place and situation where a conflict could arise that will potentially be able to engage the players in terms of getting their characters involved. This can bring together even very disparate characters. And, yes, sometimes they'll be on the opposite side of the conflict. At least in a prima fascia way. They may switch later. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is another reason that party play is often used, to avoid "PvP" conflict. This is yet another "problem" that's not really a problem, if you use the right techniques. I won't go into those here in detail either, but, essentially they involve making sure that players don't associate with their characters to the point where "Character vs Character" feels like "Player Vs Player." Character vs Character can be as much player team play as it is when the GM throws up adversity. Can be, when done right. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut either way, as potential allies or enemies, we come up with a central conflict into which the players want to get their characters involved. Again, come up with this as a group, and you'll be sure that they're interested. Communicate, and ask. Get exlicit buy in. These processes are actually quite easy. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother centralizing concept is the "relationship map" as existed before Ron Edwards wrote about them, but which Ron has made into a recognizable phenomenon and tool for RPG play. This is in some ways simply a more subtle central conflict, but in the context of a network of characters. The difference in this case is that the network in question is designed to entangle the charcters in an engaging way, and perhaps "drag" the player's characters into their conflict. <br/>\n<br/>\nA good relationship map may well make use of NPCs in the PCs backgrounds. Some won't. But in any case, the key for such a map is for the NPCs to need the PCs. Some NPC has some need that drags the PC on to the map. Is this railroading? <br/>\n<br/>\n - Grabs Vs Hooks - <br/>\nIt's just as bad to assume that a player will have his character respond to X stimulus the way you desire, as it is to force the player to always be in the same scene with others, in a game where we want player freedom to defind their character's destinies. The traditional method is to "Hook" a PC into play, onto a relationship map, or into a centralizing conflict. Hopefully one doesn't have to do so. With a well-discussed centralizing conflict, for instance, the player has already indicated a willingness to dive in. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith a relationship map, it can be a tad trickier. In that often you'll be tempted to use the usual sort of draw, like offering gold. But the problem is that this is usually Hobson's Choice. Play along, or don't play. So how do you make a PC offer automatically drag the PC onto the map? How do you create a situation that doesn't try to "Hook" the character, but instead "Grabs" the player, and makes him want to play? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer in the next post on Bangs...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134823/#Comment_134823" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T07:37:10+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  7:37AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm getting a lot out of this, so thank you!

Let me step back a moment, however, and explain something about the overall paradigm of play here. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal of this paradigm is to allow player creativity to define their character through play. We assume that this is an important part of why the players in question are playing the game. If that's not the case in your game, then all of this thread probably doesn't pertain to you. But, assuming that's what we want, the problem with a lot of play is that it's all about following the GM's pre-prepared plot. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this is that, in order for the plot to keep moving forward as designed, it will have to assume certain character responses. This directly eliminates the player's ability to make choices about their character. Or, if allowed, the plot is destroyed. The GM created plot evolved as a response to plotless roleplaying. That is, if you give players free-rein to do as they please, thinking that they'll create something like a plot, they won't usually (especially if you're playing with a system that doesn't incentivize it in anyway). So the response was to create scenarii in which the characters were made to jump through hoops so that something looking like a story was created. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell this allows the GM to be creative in terms of making up a plot, but the players don't get to be so. Or, if they try, and the GM allows them to head wherever, we're back to no plot at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe assumption is that either the GM does nothing to create plot, or he does everything to create plot. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution is to take a middle road. The GM doesn't create the plot himself, but collaborates with the players in creating it. They make it up together as they go. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this means that the GM can't be "prepared" for what may come. As I say above, however, I see this as a boon. Very little session prep. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that mean that the GM can't prepare at all, however? Am I saying, essentially, to "wing it" every time we play? No, there are techniques. Mainly...<br/>\n<br/>\n - Bangs -<br/>\nPut simply, a bang is a form of GM input into the game that gives the players a fun choice to make, but does not make any assumptions about the outcome. They are open-ended questions, presented in order to give the player a chance to be creative. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn tactical play, the GMs job is to do the same thing, to create decision-making opportunities for players. The difference is that in tactical play, the decisions are tactical. The rewards of which are the player being lauded for his own tactical prowess. In thematic play, the decisions presented are thematic. The rewards for which are accolades from the other players for the awesomeness of the plot turns that he has created. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe specifics for how to create bangs, and the many techniques for doing so, I'll leave for other threads, too. But very simply the essence is usually to put multiple things that the character values into conflict. And then let the player sort out how his character deals with that. To be clear, the things involved should be things that we identify the *player* as being interested in about his character, not neccessarily what the character is interested in. The character has no interest in finding out whether or not he values his arm more than his leg (when the loan shark comes calling), but it's potentially fascinating to the player. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut how do we know what the player is interested in? Well, for one we can ask. Nothing wrong with that method (though you can drain suspense if you telegraph). But often we don't have to, because we can look at...<br/>\n<br/>\n - Flags - <br/>\nAnother idea noted by Chris Chinn. The character sheet is often a good place to find Flags, which are indications of what interests the player. Things like class or race (better yet, homeland) are a good place to start as likely flags. Notes on relationships. But sometimes character sheets have lots of things on them, mandated by the chargen rules, that are not at all indicative of what the player is interested in in terms of the character. After all, he was forced to note that his character was human. It may not interest him at all. So be careful looking at the sheet. Again, ask, if you're not sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut better flags can be found in play. Which abilities is the character using a lot? Which ones has he raised up with his rewards? These are much better flags. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if you don't have Asperger's Syndrome, simply watch the player, and monitor their responses. It usually quickly becomes apparent what it is about the character that interests them. Make bangs up that involve these things. This all works to...<br/>\n<br/>\n - Keep Play About the Characters - <br/>\nThis is part of the paradigm that's often really hard to get across to players coming from traditional games. It took me a loooong time for it to sink in. It's not enough to say, "Well the characters went on the adventure, so it's about the characters." No. What I'm talking about is waaay deeper than that. Basically it can be stated that, optimally, nothing should occur in the game that is not directly about exploring who the character is. For instance, combats should not happen simply for us to watch the character win or lose. They are great if in happening, they reveal something new about the character. But every scene should be devised because the situation it creates, and the potential for bangs in the scene, will potentially reveal something about the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nParty play misses this mark entirely. That is, if the reason a character is in a scene, is simply to allow character interaction... while that can, yes, potentially result in us finding out new things about the character... the percentages are way, way too low. We don't want to find out about the characters when it happens as an accident of play. That's sure to bore players who are not in the scene. Set every scene up with an understanding that it will be entertaining in that we're revealing something about the character. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Beause this is what Engages Audiences - <br/>\nFinding out about the characters - how they respond to crises and dilemmas, or even just every day drama - is what entertains us as audience. Make every scene about something dramatic, and everyone not in the scene will stay watching. Here's the simple rule... if you can't figure out what the scene is for, or what it's revealing (even if that's "He hasn't changed"), then cut the scene and move on. You can be in the middle of a terrible brawl with monsters, but if you can't see what this is showing us about the characters, cut right there to the scene afterwards where there aren't enough bandages to go around, and a character has to figure out who to give his last one to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost done...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134835/#Comment_134835" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T08:07:09+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  8:07AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2008 8:10AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In conclusion to this part, all these techniques together represent a paradigm change in method of play. Yes, it takes some getting used to in that it's not the "walk the dungeon" method that's very easy to use, and with which we're all comfortable. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you want thematic play to come to the forefront, adherence to old techniques like party play and GM created plots, can really make it hard to impossible to get real quality opportunities to be creative in play. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. there's a whole body of techniqes that I've identified as being useful for getting players to "Convert" their mental processes to understand this paradigm of play. I didn't want to get into that, either, because it's very tangential to this thread. And often you don't need them if you're using the techniques above. Further they're sorta controversial in that one may believe that since there's nothing "wrong" a priori with the old paradigm, that we ought not to be even trying to convert people.

Rather than have 3 highly developed characters, you have 3 1/2 developed characters, 3 1/4 developed, and 6 1/8 developed. Disengagement has rarely been an issue for me BECAUSE we allow such a large pool of characters to choose from, and one can create a new character on the spot as well. So there's almost always a character that would "tickle my fancy" for any given scene around. It's just it takes at least twice as long to have highly developed characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134842/#Comment_134842" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T08:23:33+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  8:23AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            having a GM is such a quaint notion <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135014/#Comment_135014" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T02:09:11+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  2:09AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>P.S. there's a whole body of techniqes that I've identified as being useful for getting players to "Convert" their mental processes to understand this paradigm of play.
