I haven't made it through the whole book yet, but what I have read is solid stuff.<br/><br/>My favorite bit is from right near the beginning: "The game of Burning Wheel is about undertaking the role of a persona who is in crisis".<br/><br/>That's great character advice! Almost every BW character I've <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">created</span> burned or played in a game with has had goals and beliefs and relationships and all that great stuff, but being "in crisis" is an eye-opener for me. I think maybe a lot of the characters in my past games were missing that element.<br/><br/>Also, Luke Crane's writing in this book is great; authoritative and explanatory, but personable and engaging. I think it's one of the best-written RPG texts since Dogs in the Vineyard. (Also he has stopped over-using the word "potent", which always drove me buggy.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287339/#Comment_287339" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T16:25:15+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  4:25PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel the same way - I've played Mouse Guard a bunch since the last time I played Burning Wheel and between the last game of MG feeling too constrained by the player/GM turn and the "light" mechanics and being super inspired by the Adventure Burner I'd really love to give BW another shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287506/#Comment_287506" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T09:43:19+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  9:43AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed about the writing.

They're almost character archetypes, rather than pre-gens.<br/><br/>Also, Judd, I noticed your China Mieville-inspired city burner stuff was in the book. Nice!

It seems like the perfect game for long-term campaign play, which is something I want to do.  We have played probable 8 to 10 sessions total, and I don't feel like we've really gotten everything up an running, really singing, you know?  To be fair, our sessions are short (sometimes four, but often as little as two hours of actual gaming) because we all have a lot of commitments, and we played two games, maybe two years apart, each 4 to 5 sessions, so, after two years, it was like starting all over again.  I got the Adventure Burner (signed, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2313&amp;Mode=like">#13</a>, I wonder if I'm the biggest BW geek who, for all intents and purposes, doesn't actually play the game...) and I love it for consolidating so much of what I've already read on the BW forums, and including great new stuff and sample characters.  But (and maybe this should be a new thread, I don't want to derail Brian) I wonder if it's crazy to think a game needs more play than this before it gets good.  My thinking is, "this game is great, guys, we really just need to play it a little more and we'll really reap the rewards of learning the system," but I'd love to hear if others think that, even with a complex system, there is a limit to how many hours of play it should take to internalize, and what that limit is.<br/><br/>For the record, I had fun every time we played BW (partly because the gaming was fun, and partly because the socializing was fun), so, even though we felt clumsy with the rules, it never seemed like torture to keep with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288106/#Comment_288106" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T06:51:10+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  6:51AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a fairly rocky game of Jihad about a year and a half ago.  The big problem was one player who said, "Oh, I know how to roleplay, just tell me when to roll dice," and then played Solitaire on her computer when she was not center stage. As a result, she never fully grasped the combat system, which meant that she was nowhere near as effective in combat as her character sheet suggested she should be; and she never bothered to mark down skill checks, which meant she never advanced in any skills.  Fortunately, it was meant to be a somewhat short game.<br/><br/>There are some games where her attitude doesn't throw a monkey wrench into things, but Burning Wheel pretty much requires a higher level of player engagement in the system. I'm not sure it's measured in hours of play; I suspect it's measured in hours of study of the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288113/#Comment_288113" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T08:04:33+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  8:04AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>[...]and then played Solitaire on her computer when she was not center stage[...] There are some games where her attitude doesn't throw a monkey wrench into things </blockquote>\nReally?

Still. It seems to me you don't get to play very often. If I was in your shoes (and I'm not, but IF I WAS) I either wouldn't try and play through a campaign, and instead focus on one-shots, or perhaps two- or three-parters, OR I'd use a very simple system, that you can learn very quickly and make it sing. Like Hero's Banner, DitV, Primetime Adventures, InSpectres or even The Shadow of Yesterday. BW just has too many bits and pieces IMO for casual play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288125/#Comment_288125" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T09:40:49+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  9:40AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jumanji83</cite>Really?

So the trick is to invite her only to games where her lack of attention only affects her enjoyment of the game, and drive off Geek Social Fallacy <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> with a big stick when it shows up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288130/#Comment_288130" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T09:58:30+00:00" title="August 22, 2010  9:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think long-term campaign play is different in major ways from short-term or one-shots. Luke says repeatedly in the Adventure Burner that BW is designed for long-term play, and the mechanics certainly support that.<br/><br/>Sometimes the answer is to put more effort into something, even if that seems strange to say about gaming. John and I have played in a couple BW campaigns in the last couple years that never  took off, and I've played in one other with similar results. But I'm willing to accept that the solution isn't to give up and play a different game, it's to play Burning Wheel again, with RENEWED AND FEVER-EYED DEDICATION.<br/><br/>And, lest I seem Ishmael-ish, the campaigns we have played were fun. It's just that a high bar is set by or mutual love for the BW rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
