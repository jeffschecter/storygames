All my attempts to start games using my own sets of rules became too frustrating or just bogged down, and finally my friend said, "Bret let's just play Vampire." We LARPed together in college and I've had a hankering to play it, but it's fallen out of favor with everyone I know so this was perfect. We got another friend of ours to join us who's been having a hard time getting a game going where he lives and we were off.<br/><br/>I picked San Jose for no real reason, whipped up a situation and some NPCs, let the PCs create whoever they wanted, and have been having them set up independent waves for their scenes, letting them do their own thing and crossing them over when necessary. It's worked really well. Jere, who works a lot, plays at a much slower pace than Shael, who is unemployed, and I work in front of a computer all day and occasionally have internet breaks so we're keeping a fluid chronology so me and Shael can churn out scenes while Jere is still in work.<br/><br/>The way Wave is semi-realtime is neat. Sometimes it works like playing playbypost, sometimes it works like playing in a chatroom. Sometimes I'll be typing up a big long-ass post and Shael will interrupt me with some dialogue for his character. So far it's been the least annoying online roleplaying I've ever done.<br/><br/>Returning to Vampire was great, too. We're using Requiem and I missed having piles of sourcebooks to sift through and mine for ideas. The Requiem sourcebooks are really worthwhile too. I missed having a rich setting to pick through. I was beginning to find having to fill in tons of gaps in a setting to be exhausting so this is a nice break.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251622/#Comment_251622" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T13:11:32+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  1:11PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and the fiction. San Jose is a city where everyone in charge was, within the last five years or so, eaten by the Carthians. So the Carthians took over like a revolutionary movement and are now in charge, and claiming to be democratic idealists who are not beyond using violence to get their way.<br/><br/>Shael is playing DJ I AM, a trance DJ who practices transcendental meditation and is trying to join the Ordo Dracul.<br/><br/>Jere is playing David, a brilliant conspiracy theorist who is also trying to join the Ordo Dracul. There is no Ordo Dracul in the city. That's because they were the ones who were eaten by the Carthians. DJ I AM and David do not know this, but suspect. So now the Carthians are all paranoid and that's headed towards disaster.<br/><br/>There is also a diablerist bloodline of Toreador in the city and now a Toreador elder is here to "reclaim the blood." DJ I AM belongs to that diablerist bloodline.<br/><br/>Also there's some Satan Worshipping Nosferatu that beat DJ I AM's head in and stole his van. They're called the Fucker Brothers.<br/><br/>David has had an easy time of it yet but that's just because Shael and I play all day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251642/#Comment_251642" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T16:11:34+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  4:11PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>San Jose is a city where everyone in charge was, within the last five years or so, eaten by the Carthians.
