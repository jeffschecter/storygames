You can do a lot more stretching, walking around and experimenting with "cool" stuff and kind of figure out where it's all heading at more leisurely pace.<br/><br/>With Sorcerer you really need a right-here-right-now grounded context.  This is my character and this his crisis and this is what's at stake RIGHT NOW.  It doesn't have to start at 11 but you can't really build to something from vague mysteries either.  Each and every scene should have some kind of emotional weight in its own right.  Otherwise the mechanics simply fail to function.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210645/#Comment_210645" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T17:37:00+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  5:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played both.<br/><br/>MC was very fun in the set up phase in which we defined the setting and what magic was. Unfortunately the rest of the game was not so much fun as we had some issues with the bidding resolution system, I understand that there is a new edition of the game that may fix some of those issues. The best part of the game is the magic fact list, which work like aspects from FATE (spend point get plus 2 even) but have a price or exception and they are made through play. The consensus after the game would be to just play FATE next time with the magic list and pitch session from MC. <br/><br/>Sorcerer has been a blast every time I play it, and in comparison to the MC what Jesse said is dead one, there is a sense of consequence and urgency in Sorcerer when you make choices in a conflict, I think the set up and grid for Sorcerer does a better job of creating a situation that maters to the characters and Humanity is a great tool for saying this game is about X. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210646/#Comment_210646" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T17:37:44+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  5:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorcerer scares me.

In Sorceror the way magic works tends to be very focused, and the <i>role</i> sorcery plays in the overall story is built into the game from the outset -- its relationship to Humanity is built in to the mechanics.<br/><br/>Mortal Coil is very open-ended, and based on my limited play I feel like its systems interact in much more straightforward ways, and sometimes not at all. The Magic facts system is basically completely separable from the rest of the game, as are Passions, and (to my endless chagrin) the actual mechanical resolution system is kind of meh. (The new edition definitely explains it better but at least in my case that just meant that now I was quite sure I wanted to replace it with something else, instead of wondering if maybe I had missed something awesome.)<br/><br/>One thing MC will support more easily is a large variety in types and schools of magic -- and adaptability in terms of what magic does and how it works, as the game progresses. Magic can mean very different things for different characters. Sorceror really needs a lot of prep to hit the ground running, and that includes locking down the basic shape &amp; limitations of magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210660/#Comment_210660" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T19:02:31+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  7:02PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, uh, Sorc just turns to ashes in my mouth.

In all for the three games of Mortal Coil that I have played, the people at the table have to find a situation that they want to explore.. And then make passions that push in interesting directions. That is to say build tension with in the group of players much like Burning Wheel does with believes. Then see where you go..

But still, if I was going to make a game like Sorcerer, I'd make sure the demonic powers, at least when used against mortals, were always impactful.  (In fact, right after reading Sorcerer, I made this little game called <i>torn</i> where, when you used magic, you just tossed out the regular resolution system--you simply got what you wanted--but you also drew cards to figure out who and what was randomly hurt, killed or destroyed as a side effect of the magic, with anyone being physically <i>and</i> emotionally close to you being potential targets).<br/><br/>From what I gather of Mortal Coil, if you bid enough, you get your way, so the random whiff factor shouldn't be a problem there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210713/#Comment_210713" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-06T10:50:34+00:00" title="June  6, 2009 10:50AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would chime in to indicate that Mortal Coil is more flexible, in that the magic in Mortal Coil has a cost, but if the group is not interested in a world where magic is horrendously corrosive to your soul, you don't remove the driving engine of the game, as you do if you pick a more casual Humanity/Demon combo in Sorcerer. <br/><br/>Not that this is what the OP says he wants but there it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210726/#Comment_210726" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-06T12:31:28+00:00" title="June  6, 2009 12:31PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite><br/>I am laughing because I think this is the first time in five years that I entirely agree with you.

Not to the extent of being useless, but you're unlikely to get any of the huge, sparkly, destroy-the-world type spells out of it. It's more your grim-and-gritty horror than your urban fantasy. Mortal Coil will let you do more or less anything with its magic system, but is extremely diffuse in its nature and could cause problems with people trying to do too much with magic, or take some control away from the GM. That's not a criticism, it's what the game is meant to do. It all depends if you want to approach it from the angle of a traditional RPG or from something more akin to a group storytelling session. Also bear in mind that Mortal Coil is diceless which a lot of people aren't fond of.<br/><br/>A quick disclaimer though, my version of Mortal Coil is the pre-revision one. I don't know what changes and additions have been made to the revised version.<br/><br/>As a third alternative, have you thought of adapting the PDQ system? Questers of the Middle Realms puts forward a pretty decent magic system for it, and there's also the Zorceror of Zo which may have some useful magic tips.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210798/#Comment_210798" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-07T12:20:54+00:00" title="June  7, 2009 12:20PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>It's more your grim-and-gritty horror than your urban fantasy. </blockquote>\nActually, that is an EXCELLENT distinction.

The group defines what this vital, thematic element of positive definition of human behavior for the game.  Questions of morality and behavior will circle this thematic question.  (There's nothing strange or odd or over-intellectual about this in terms of story construction -- which is <i>Sorcerer's</i> goal.  I just watched the first season of HBO's ROME.  Every scene was about the thematic question of "Loyalty."  Finding a thematic question helps a story hang together.)<br/><br/>In scenes, the characters will be faced with choices that will ask, in one way or another, will you be Human or -- not Human.  Not every scene, and it won't occur in such a way as to sound like a law school ethics class exercise.  But it will be there, showing up as such questions do in solid stories one finds on TV or Films.  When it happens, the players will make a roll: A Humanity Gain roll if they make a choice that involves being Human, and a Humanity Loss roll if they do something that goes against the definition of Humanity.<br/><br/>As the Gain or Loss rolls are made, the characters Humanity rating, on a scale of 0-10 will rise or fall.  The more Human things the character does, the higher the the Humanity.  The more not Human things, the lower.  If Humanity reaches 0 then the character has lost all Humanity.  He or she is now, for all purposes, <i>inhuman</i>.  The player loses the character and hands him over to the GM, as such a character is beyond the pale, and is no longer worthy of being a protagonist.  A villain, yes.  But that's it.<br/><br/>If Sorcerer is a game about emotionally squalid people doing emotionally squalid things, then by definition the Humanity of the characters are going to drive down to zero, and fast.  Which means the game is about handing your character sheet over to the GM.  Which it isn't.  So this is nonsense.<br/><br/>I'm not saying people don't play this way.  I've read accounts of this.  I even played this way in my first game (though the GM and I used a rule in <i>Sorcerer's Soul</i> to re-write the character sheet and let me have the sheet back.  My character, driven mad by his actions, went on a path of redemption to make good on what he had done in the past.)<br/><br/>I am saying that some stories offer characters bad choices to make, and sometimes characters make those bad choices.  Some of my favorite shows do this: Battlestar Galactica, Rome, Dexter, Deadwood, Rescue Me, Breaking Bad, Lost.  Certainly my favorite plays do this: Shakespeare and the Greek tragedies.  Some people might consider the characters in these stories emotionally squalid, I suppose.  In my observations of live, they are simply very human.<br/><br/>To assume that a game where characters are given free range on a moral scale is to create a game where the characters will be emotionally squalid is certainly a conclusion people jump to.  But it has nothing to do with the game itself.  But it is a failure, in my view, of both creative imagination and moral imagination.  The <i>Sorcerer</i> rules, as written, make it clear that when you create a Player Character it better be someone you want to hang out with.  It isn't <i>Kill Puppies for Satan</i> at all -- and to assume it is, that one should be making, by definition, emotionally squalid characters out of the gate, is wrong.<br/><br/>Yes.  I said wrong.  As in, sex can be done wrong.  Like trying to insert a penis in the ear.  That kind of wrong.  When I see people like Shreyas stating how he played the game wrong, it always makes me sad for the same reason I don't like people shifting gears at the wrong time when driving.  <br/><br/>Lore, in <i>Sorcerer</i>, is an understanding of how to use tools called Demons.  And Demons help one get things done.  Like a gun can help you get things done.   And so can Hannibal Lector.  Or the Ring of Power.  Or Dexter's "Dark Passenger."  <br/><br/>Sorcerer says: "You have a character who needs to get something done so badly that he or she willing to pick up a gun -- and even use it -- to get that thing done.  But it's not just a matter of who might get hurt when you use the gun -- though that matters -- but who'll you might become by the time you finally put that gun back down."  By definition you've created a character who is so driven to get something done, and the stakes are so high, that picking up a gun makes sense.<br/><br/>I don't find anything emotionally squalid about a soldier, or Clarice, of Frodo, or Dexter -- who all interact with creatures and things one might assume to be Demons if translated to <i>Sorcerer</i>.  I do find them desperate to get something done and grabbing at a tool that puts their humanity at risk.  <i>That</i> is what <i>Sorcerer</i> is about.<br/><br/>That might not be what someone wants to play.  It certainly seems different than the fun of Mortal Coil. But the game certainly has no quality of moral squalidness as a definition of what the game is about built into it.  It's actually an incredibly moral game.

Mortal Coil has much more room for changing the character is very concrete ways based on passions going up and down and being destroyed or born through conflict.<br/><br/>Mortal Coil and Sorcerer both allow for player drive setting creation but Mortal Coil has more concrete steps and procedures.<br/><br/>In my experiences, Sorcerer leads to more surprising play, the conflict resolution is more shocking and intense than Mortal Coil's chips.<br/><br/>I like both a whole lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211137/#Comment_211137" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T13:58:32+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  1:58PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually I think Shreyas's comments are pretty much accurate, at least for casual exposure to the game and the casual nature of the response he gave.<br/><br/>Sorcerers begin the game having done <i>wrong things</i> for however your group has defined "wrong."  There is a phase of char-gen in the core rules that briefly describes making the character worthy of being the hero of a movie--but it's a brief bit of kinda fluffy text and easily overlooked.  (It's a key component of the design, but like many other aspects of Sorcerer's design it could really stand to be made more explicit.)  Sorcerers have to be lousy human beings in some lights, because they begin play having already risked their Humanity at least once through binding the demon.  Even if, in the fiction, it's plausible that the character has a demon "by accident," mechanically there's still opprobrium attached to the character.<br/><br/>And while it's certainly possible to play a noble sorcerer, the GM is going to be putting a lot of pressure on the player to commit further sins and summon more demons.  Even if the player resists these temptations, it doesn't change the fact that his or her magical powers all involve knowledge and manipulation of wrongfulness / sin / squalor, whatever you want to call it.<br/><br/>The fact that the the sorcerers and their actions are ethically dubious is sort of the point of the game.<br/><br/>I don't think Shreyas's reaction was 100% accurate in describing sorcerer for all players everywhere, but I can certainly see how a person might get that impression.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211145/#Comment_211145" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T14:14:06+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  2:14PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>the GM is going to be putting a lot of pressure on the player to commit further sins and summon more demons.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, basically.

We know.<br/><br/><br/>James,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Sorcerers have to be lousy human beings in some lights, because they begin play having already risked their Humanity</blockquote>\nThis is pretty much true for any character in any story that holds the interest of any person over the age of 12.  As for real life people, I'll only speak for myself, but I know myself pretty well and by the standards I try to live by I know I've failed on more than one occasion.  I'm assuming you'd have to hold me beyond the pale as well.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>The fact that the the sorcerers and their actions are ethically dubious is sort of the point of the game.</blockquote>\nI know you see the game this way.  But no.  This is wrong.  It lets you see the game Shreyas' view. But it simply is inaccurate.  It's that the characters are conflicted - not dubious.  Like any character in Shakespeare's tragedies and histories, the Greek tragedies, most cable TV fare, and any movie worth watching a second time.  Indiana Jones leaves the woman he loves tied up in a Nazi tent because he covets ancient artifacts.  Sheriff Brody in JAWS turns a blind eye to political corruption to keep his new job.  Even in these simple popcorn movies the character do the wrong things.<br/><br/>The GM doesn't put pressure on the PCs to make them do anything.  He puts pressure on them to give the Players opportunities to have their PCs make choices.  This what what a writer does when he writes a script -- he provides these opportunities for the character to make choices and reveal who they are.  This is what makes stories work.<br/><br/>I understand this is how you see the game.  I wouldn't want to play that either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211185/#Comment_211185" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T16:35:12+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  4:35PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks, there was a fellow I talked to on another forum who was convinced that DitV was about being the Mormon Taliban.

Mind you, he did later bind them all up in a brass vessel and throw them into the sea. Or was it a lake? I think it was a lake...

Players in Sorceror are as likely to get away with it if they're careful. Again though, this is all assuming that the players do feel immorrally obligated by their demons to be bastards. I haven't played Sorceror much, but I have a demon-based game of my own that I have played and I run it to the following ethic: it is the job of the demon to tempt its sorceror with unholy power and try and get him to do morally questionable things. It is the job of the sorceror to avoid temptation whilst manipulating his demon into such a position as he's getting the unholy power anyway without having to become a bastard himself. The challenge, and indeed the focus in my opinion, is in this ballancing act.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211391/#Comment_211391" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T12:05:05+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 12:05PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ashok, here's a question, if it's "Unholy power", then isn't making use of it morally questionable in and of itself?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211499/#Comment_211499" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T17:59:06+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  5:59PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading this forum I got interested in Mortal Coil, which I've never really known much about.<br/><br/>I checked out the preview, and it was interesting, but I hit one of the illustrations, and I'm like, "the way they talked about it in the Sorcerer &amp; Mortal Coil thread, I wasn't really expecting a bloody, possibly eyeless woman standing over a dead baby in a sinkful of blood in a public restroom.

The thing about Mortal Coil is the images are really the only setting assistance you'll get. Sorceror might not be entirely 'what you bring to the table' but Mortal Coil is pretty much nothing but. Unless the revision added a setting that I'm not aware of, so please somebody correct me if I'm wrong as I've not read the revised version.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Ashok, here's a question, if it's "Unholy power", then isn't making use of it morally questionable in and of itself?</blockquote>\nOnly if you accept that using unholy power for good purposes is impossible. I personally do not really believe there is such a thing as 'unholy' power. I don't really believe in good and evil either, but if there is a good and an evil then it is in how the individual chooses to use his power, not some kind of bizarre 'power flavour' system. If I pray to god to have you assassinated, I'm being evil. If I con the devil into saving your life, I'm being good. I've heard the maxim 'the road to hell is paved with good intentions' sure, but it's the people who have the bad intentions that get through the door when they arrive.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JenniferRodgers" title="JenniferRodgers"><img alt="JenniferRodgers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/847/n8DBFAZ4ANH6I.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JenniferRodgers">JenniferRodgers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211879/#Comment_211879" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T06:42:14+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  6:42AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend tipped me off about this thread.

In one, I played a bastard ex-cop trying to control a prison block after being incarcerated for corruption and murder (think Vic Mackey if he actually went to prison). While in the other I played a big, earnest bear-of-a-merc who regarded his fellow squad-mates has his family and put them first before himself. Yes, both characters were sorcerers in the they summoned and commanded demons to accomplish goals what were deeply important to them. However, In both cases it wasn't a matter of the GM using the demons as an excuse to push the player into contemptible behavior, but rather creating opportunity for the players make meaningful decisions that defined their characters.</p>\n<p>I think the point Judd made upthread is a good one; it can be just as interesting to rise to Humanity 10 as it is to sink to Humanity 0.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213037/#Comment_213037" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T17:55:43+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  5:55PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: edheil</cite>cthulhoid horrors and naked dudes sound relatively harmless compared to La Llorona.</blockquote>\nShe was cool and all, but in the end our boy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man_(2000_TV_series)" rel="nofollow">Darien Fawkes</a> took her down - but so sad...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213057/#Comment_213057" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T20:56:05+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  8:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mean your not surposed to be shooting people in the face with DITV? <br/><br/>Guess we were doing it wrong then......                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213065/#Comment_213065" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T23:35:38+00:00" title="June 17, 2009 11:35PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2009 12:19AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Logos,<br/><br/>Nope.  That's not what Jeff said.  Jeff wrote, "Nobody is forced to do emotionally squalid things in Sorcerer, just as nobody <i>has</i> to shoot people in the face in DitV."<br/><br/>One certainly can have PCs shoot folks in the face in DiTV, just as players <i>can</i> have their PCs do emotionally squalid things in <i>Sorcerer</i>.  But DiTV isn't "about" shooting people in the face, just as <i>Sorcerer</i> isn't "<i>about</i>" doing emotionally squalid things, as Shreyas phrased it.  Each phrasing would be too limiting a view of what the games are about.  And each phrasing straight-jackets player options for their characters.  Which simply isn't how the games are built.<br/><br/>It's the difference between having an option on the table, and assuming that one option is the reason for the game.  One is a story where we don't know where we'll end up.
