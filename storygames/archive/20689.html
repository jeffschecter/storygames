These can be anything thematically appropriate.<br/><br/>Every Character and Scene has a set of Events which are visible to everyone and rolled for when encountered. These are the points of uncertainty and the only elements determined by the system.<br/><br/>Each Event has a set of 6 Outcomes. The GM gets to choose one, while the player gets to choose or invalidate (to prevent the GM from picking it) one for every success they roll. These can also be determined randomly.<br/><br/>Any time a player triggers an Event, they roll a number of d6 equal to the associated Asset. Even numbers are successes. Alternatively they roll the same number of Fate Dice where each [-] invalidates an Outcome, each [+] requires choosing one, and each [-][+] pair cancel each other out. Players always have the option to avoid triggering an Event entirely by changing their action.<br/><br/>Ideally, Outcomes should be easy to integrate into the narrative by describing how you achieve and/or avoid certain ends.<br/><br/>Examples forthcoming, as I still need to give this some time to jello.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454191/#Comment_454191" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-25T06:32:09+00:00" title="June 25, 2016  6:32AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So one of my goals is eliminating Target Numbers (at least those set arbitrarily by the GM), and one of the ways I'm attempting that is with results that determine discreet states (broken arm) as opposed to degrees of values (Arm HP: -6). Every success should be a single event or transition, not just more of a value like damage, speed, etc.<br/><br/>In most RPGs, degrees of values end up translated into discreet states in the fiction anyway. For example, jumping far enough (degree) means you leap over the pit (discreet). They're also used to delay game ending outcomes. For example, dying only after running out of HP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454193/#Comment_454193" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-25T07:58:26+00:00" title="June 25, 2016  7:58AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2016 12:00PM by Rickard.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You got really weird results if you're going with -1,1 dice.<br/><br/><a href="http://anydice.com/program/8b39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://anydice.com/program/8b39</a><br/><br/>Even if you're using fate dice, it means that higher numbers give more random and the possibility to extreme outcomes.<br/><br/>Also, there will be a lot of Outcomes that wont come up, i.e. a lot of work for nothing. Just one Character in one Scene will create 12 different Outcomes. Sure, the Characters will reuse their own Outcomes (like moves, right?) but how many Scenes are we talking about in a session? 5? That's 30 Outcomes right there.<br/><br/>And then I haven't taken the Events into account. If every Scene has two Events, that's 60 Outcomes that someone needs to create for a single five Scene session. And where's the flexibility. Lets say that an Outcome throws the story in a different direction that creates Scenes that aren't prepared. How is this handled? Should someone make up new Events and Outcomes on the spot?<br/><br/>But perhaps I misunderstood something. I'm otherwise positive to create lists with stuff to be used during sessions.

I'm just rolling dice to produce an outcome; what my character is doing and how seems almost irrelevant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454213/#Comment_454213" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-25T21:50:10+00:00" title="June 25, 2016  9:50PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, example time.

It didn't matter if these were positive or negative, only that they represented what one would expect to happen in a haunted house.<br/><br/><b>Avoiding mutually exclusive outcomes</b>. If one outcome was <i>the ghost tries to protect you</i>, but another was <i>the ghost tries to kill you</i>, then picking one will negate the other, which means 1 success could effectively cause/avoid 2 outcomes.<br/><br/><b>A logical consequence of the action taken</b>. It's all too easy to just go full story mode and write things from an author's perspective. For example, you open a door <i>and</i> find a monster, but a monster <i>being</i> behind that door is not a logical consequence of your character's action.<br/><br/>Squinting closely you'll see that this is basically a more formalized version of the resolution system in 7th Sea 2nd Ed, which suffers from the same problems being addressed here. For example, every success (Raise) theoretically enables/prevents a single action/event, yet in practice doesn't because <i>there's nothing which defines what a single action actually is</i>. Is 'visit your lover's boudoir' a single action, or several like 'sneak past guards', 'climb scaffold', and 'lockpick window'? So a GM can get whatever result they want simply by dividing the action into enough parts (through Action Sequences) and/or setting the target numbers (of Consequences) high enough, and if they could normally do that anyway then why go through all this trouble?\n<blockquote>Even if you're using fate dice, it means that higher numbers give more random and the possibility to extreme outcomes.</blockquote>\nActually the outcomes become <i>more</i> predictable as the number of dice increases, and in practice these outcomes are far less extreme than what you get with other randomizers like d20s and d100s.<br/><br/>I do want to modify the implementation though.<br/><br/>Things a character <i>is or has</i> are rated from 1 to 5. When taking a Named Action, a player rolls a number of Fate Dice equal to their rating in the associated Attribute/Asset/Advantage/Etc. Every [+] is a result they <i>caused</i>, every [-] is a result they <i>avoided</i>, and pairs do <i>not</i> cancel out. And yes this means a higher rating may not always be 'advantageous'.\n<blockquote>But perhaps I misunderstood something.</blockquote>\nInevitable, as I basically dumped a box of Legos on the floor and asked "what's this?", which is a question <i>I</i> can't even answer yet. But this gives me an idea as to what people consider certain words and concepts to mean so I can use different terminology instead of spending effort to redefine an existing lexicon.<br/><br/>That's why I replaced 'Scene' with 'Situation' and changed 'Event' to 'Action' in the example above. Now we'll find out what concepts are commonly associated with those words.\n<blockquote>The main issue I see with this (not necessarily a problem for everyone, note) is that there is no obvious link between what's happening in the fiction and the possible outcomes.</blockquote>\nThat's exactly what I'm trying to avoid<br/><br/>This experiment is exploring (somewhat extreme) solutions that do not necessarily represent my preferred style of play in pursuit of mechanical/fictional coherence.

Well, then it's much better.<br/><br/>However, you seem to have re-invented Apocalypse World's "moves" (particularly "custom moves"). Is that your intention?<br/><br/>We already know that those work great. But what are you trying to add to this? <br/><br/>The "cause/avoid" dichotomy, however, that jumped out at me. That's a new piece of technology. And potentially interesting - if it's just "here's a list of stuff you'd like, and here's a list of stuff you don't want", it's only slightly interesting. (The dice narrow your choices, that could be fruitful or frustrating, depending on how exactly you're writing the moves.)<br/><br/>However, if there's <i>some fun thing</i> you can do with "causing" and "avoiding" which adds new information to this, then you have something which builds on the AW "move" concept, and perhaps in a pretty interesting way. Now we're building on this technology to create something new!<br/><br/>For example, let's say one of the outcomes is something like "You become separated from the party" or "Someone is injured". <br/><br/><i>Avoiding</i> this could mean:<br/><br/>* <i>No one</i> is separated from the party/injured.<br/><br/>Or:<br/><br/>* <i>You</i> are not separated from the party/injured.<br/><br/>Those are quite different!<br/><br/><i>Causing</i> this could mean:<br/><br/>* You get to choose <i>who</i> is separated from the party/injured. (Which could be yourself.)<br/><br/>Usually, not as good as "avoiding". But sometimes, if you want to get separated or injured (to take the blow for a loved one, or because you led the group into an ambush), or you want to betray a companion, this could be a very attractive option!<br/><br/>Now that's getting more interesting to me. You could build in risk/control this way: if you take lead on a particular action, like moving into a certain room, starting a fight, or performing a seance, by default you will be the one facing the outcomes, both good and bad. Roll badly, and all the bad stuff is probably happening to you (or at least out of your control). Roll better, though, and perhaps even if you don't *avoid* the bad stuff, you'll have some control over where and how it lands.<br/><br/>That's getting more juicy!<br/><br/>You'll also need to distinguish between things which happen by default (if no dice are spent), like "someone gets injured", and things which only happen <i>if</i> dice are spent. <br/><br/>Logically, those would be the things to avoid vs. the things you could achieve, but there might be a more interesting way of doing that, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454219/#Comment_454219" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-26T00:17:49+00:00" title="June 26, 2016 12:17AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for linking the action to the developing fiction, my preference would be to drop the whole "Asset = number of dice" thing, and, instead, calculate the relevant number of dice from the fictional situation.

I would get rid of Assets entirely, in that case (or use a simpler rule, like 1 bonus die if you have an applicable Asset).<br/><br/>I brought that up when you asked about rules which connect the character's actions to the ruleset (e.g. the character has to consider whether they can find an object belonging to the ghost before beginning the seance).

So I built the skill system so characters have all the same skill list but can further personalize those skills in specific ways I labeled <i>specializations</i>. While the skills do get numerical bonuses that players can increase, specializations don't add numerical bonuses but state fictional rules for their use instead.<br/><br/>A player with high perception but no darkvision can still roll to discern shapes in poor light, but one with low perception and darkvision rolls to see details or hidden things in the dark.<br/><br/>A magician may have high magic combat related skills, but he still needs to rise his levels in stealth (invisibility) to go completely unnoticed, like a thief with high stealth and no magic can. Basically this prevents players for investing all their points on a single skill that does everything, so I can let players define any specialization they want on skills already defined. <br/><br/>Fiction wise, my rule is that nothing in the character sheet can give players an automatic success. They can earn it through their efforts in the fiction, yes, but being inhumanly fast doesn't mean you can beat everyone all the time. But then again, not because your character failed at doing what he trained all his life to do, but because the opponent can still anticipate your next move or be otherwise prepared for it, maybe outperform you by sheer luck or other smart move. So lately, I don't wait for a high roll as a GM to present opponents as fearsome, player's low rolls present a better chance for that.<br/><br/>The rest is solved by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> asking the player "How exactly do you do that?" meaning how do they use the skill they mentioned to get the goal they want. Only then if the asset is applicable and/or makes sense in terms of the fiction to use in the way described, as a GM I can either decide to concede an automatic success, ask for a roll or give an explanation of why it wouldn't work based on the logic of the setting used and conditions presented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454309/#Comment_454309" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-28T19:09:27+00:00" title="June 28, 2016  7:09PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>You've got a good connect to possible outcomes in this system, but no real strong connection to "what the character is doing".</blockquote>\nI'm certain I don't understand what you mean here, as I've done nothing <i>but</i> connect what a character is doing to the possible outcomes.

It's either too cumbersome with rules and mechanics meant to make it fair and chess-like, hand wawed until less talkative players and GMs turn it into a "I hit it-you miss" laconic exchange, or dirty-hippie fashioned in a poetic way thatonly experienced actors/writers can play it right.<br/><br/>The chess like approach ends up producing problems like loopholes in the rules that deform the fictional game with the intrusion of mechanics that wouldn't make sense not only on the real world but in any of the settings used as reference (<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Peasant_Railgun" rel="nofollow">like the peasant railgun</a>) or at least, slows down the game way too much for my tastes, when the GM and/or the players have to waste game time searching for rules.<br/><br/>Reducing the exchange to the intent means that you will be mostly using the system as a way to add anything interesting to the combat, which in some cases translates to numerical stats and bonuses exchange. It's a valid fun, but personally, not my fun.<br/><br/>Decreasing system data exchange and trying to make the whole conversation about description potentially increases the risk of turning the game into the most nocive form of forum roleplaying, where players manipulate the narration to obtain advantages by stepping over other's narrative rights and spotlight. In forum it doesn't go past one talented player writing more than others, but in tabletop gaming it translates to a sort of competition for spotlight hoarding and less time/opportunities/worse quality of the experience for less talented players.<br/><br/>So, my take ended up being a middle point using my judgement in a way that I can't possibly mechanize, so I turned it instead into a procedure. When a player answers the question "what do you do?" in my table, the initial answer is more or less the intent. "I attack him with my axe" if the <i>final</i> intent is to kill, scare or mutilate the opponent, doesn't need to be my concern yet. Then I ask the player "ok, how do you do that?" to get a clearer picture of what is happening. At best, the description will add or change the intent, at worst it will just add color to the scene. Nevertheless this description is the base for me to give a proper feedback either the dice rolled after are high or low, either a hit or a miss.<br/><br/>If the player's description says "I aim to his neck with an horizontal cut" then the intent is to kill. I can decide that's an aimed attack and add penalties or just take it as a general direction and ask the player for a roll. A critical would meant the opponent is either beheaded instantly, or he is wounded and his armor is broken if it offered neck protection according to the piece of art I'm using for reference. <br/><br/>For me whatever makes sense given the references, preparation or circumstances may block the final intent despite what the dice say, <i>but only if I find it interesting to offer such outcome to the players</i>, which is the part I can't actually codify into any kind of system. I mean, have we been extending the combat too long? Does it feel like we've been rolling dice and doing repetitive things for the past ten or twenty minutes? Then it's a perfect chance to behead the guy, have his companions run in disarray and wrap up the combat. Has it been 30 mins of actually interesting and satisfying combat and nobody wants to let it end here? Then the armour saved him and he continues fighting. It's all about the energy I'm being able to give and the perception of the energy I'm receiving from the players, not about an exact amount of time or parts of the system used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454360/#Comment_454360" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-29T23:14:05+00:00" title="June 29, 2016 11:14PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So the better you are, in this system, the higher the chance that something (really) bad (or good) happens.

The reason we <i>care</i> about "How exactly do you do that?" has to do with quality of player experience.  Accordingly, any mechanics that don't focus on that, and instead focus on fictional outcomes or the like, are gonna be superfluous to the endeavor.<br/><br/>A good mechanic for "How exactly do you do that?" would be one which helps the players captivate each other with vivid description.  Perhaps some way of enlisting everyone's ideas or referencing other sources of inspiration?  Perhaps a compelling speech convention or procedure?  I'm happy to brainstorm, but I don't know if this is the place for that.<br/><br/>"Reward the type of behavior you want" is a common suggestion, but writing a rule that says "fanmail points for good description!" is a mixed bag.<br/><br/>I do think partial solutions exist, though.  The presence of a "Tell me more" card in a game with a small number of card prompts (Archipelago 2, I think?).  Fanmail as training wheels.  The "What does that look like?" prompt.  My Delve session intro procedures where we take a moment to cover the details of what all the characters look like and then soak in the environment.  There are lots of ways to cultivate an interest in rich experience of fictional detail for its own sake, and once that's achieved, you don't really need any mechanics.<br/><br/>If I'm missing the point, oops; please ignore the above.  This thread has lost me more than once.  If the issue is simply "how do we connect Skill to Goal" I know tons of mechanics for that.

Putting the design/prep focus on the unique moment of conflict, rather than on the broad type of conflict and/or the participant(s).  I can imagine brainstorming Events as per Bangs (based on who wants what and established interests and dramatic tensions) and then "statting them up" by assembling 6-outcome lists from some sort of game-provided GM materials (category lists, complications, AW Move outcomes &amp; Hard Moves, etc.).<br/><br/>If you then wanted to make "what the characters do" <i>also</i> matter, I think there are plenty of ways to add onto that premise.  You could even add onto the outcomes lists based on what the character does, providing 7 or 9 or 12 to ultimately resolve amongst.  Maybe some character actions could add only good things to the list, while other actions could add both good and bad.  So, if your stats add more to an endeavor with more inherent risk, that'd be an interesting choice -- every character could have a super risky thing that they're better at than their best safe thing.  I'll probably develop this idea in another thread; just wanted to provide some idea fodder for working with what's here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454398/#Comment_454398" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T07:03:35+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  7:03AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2016 7:05AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And I don't want a player declaring a result without describing the action they're taking.<br/></blockquote>\nIt seems fairly clear to me that you understand this feature of this proposed system you're discussing here. I'm not sure why you don't see how that could be a negative.<br/><br/>If you value developing a rich fiction (prior to engaging the system) and the players describing their characters' actions in details (with the goal of achieving their intent), this system will not help you.<br/><br/>If you value going straight from action or intent to outcome, and then narrating the details *after the fact*, this is great.

(In other words, it was looking for solutions for things which something like the Primetime Adventures resolution method does NOT satisfy.) So I assumed you were presenting your idea here as a "solution" to that problem - but it is, in fact, no such thing.

In this system you <i>have</i> to describe how the action leads to the outcome or it doesn't happen in the fiction, and if you can't you should pick a different outcome. The only difference between this and describing how an asset benefits you in an action is that there's a clear start and end point.<br/><br/>However I see exactly this problem in Apocalypse World and the actual plays from Vincent Baker. Not sure why, but those sessions feel like they're no so much telling a story as <i>engineering</i> one, and they're very different from the sessions I get from the same engine.
