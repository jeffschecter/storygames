Any specific designs?  I'm heading in the direction of t-shirts with chibis of the main characters... being very, very in character, archtypical and cute, while retaining the baseline level of latent sexy that Ben desires.<br/><br/>The posters are probably going to be more like prints of the character sprites being themselves, or of them with their Anchors and mecha.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>But swag is really not a big priority for me as a game consumer.</blockquote>\nNor for us as game designers; but progress has been remarkably swift on the coding, and when my lead programmer goes "This'll be playable this Sunday and polished in two weeks; wanna talk swag?" ...well, I begin to think that we could have a couple offerings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
