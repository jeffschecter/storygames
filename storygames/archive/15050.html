I wouldn't know how to randomize resolution.<br/><br/>It would be cool if the haziness of memory before sleep could be incorporated as a feature of the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342010/#Comment_342010" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-08T18:38:26+00:00" title="September  8, 2011  6:38PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Randomization, each player has a bag of beads and they can wager zero to three of them at a time.  Should be playable by touch alone.  Winner gets narrative control for that round, ties allow for partial success but usually come with a cost.  If both sides bet zero, each side gets a minor negative outcome instead of a partial success.  Expended beads are placed in a discard pile/pouch.  The number of beads each side has determines the relative length of the scene.  <br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scndthe2nd" title="scndthe2nd"><img alt="scndthe2nd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scndthe2nd">scndthe2nd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342011/#Comment_342011" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-08T18:52:26+00:00" title="September  8, 2011  6:52PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm assuming its for kids, but i've been wrong before. Set it in a fantasy environment, i'm almost thinking dragons and chess pieces. You can take anything you have around you -- a slipper, pjs, blanket or pillow or whatever, and you make that into something else (pjs become armor or a blanket becomes a robe, a pillow can be a shield or a chest or a book bag with tools in it, get creative). I'm thinking this would be a neat precursor to dream states. <br/>\n<br/>\nTheres no need to get dice involved in bed, do rock paper scissors or pick a number for random chance, but I hardly think its needed. A big list of rules or mechanics late at night sounds like a hassle.<br/>\n<br/>\n If we're talking about a bedtime story, I like the idea of exchanging narration control, maybe even have one person control the party and the other control the obstacles, then change off, maybe after a timer or something, set the alarm clock for sleep mode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342016/#Comment_342016" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-08T20:37:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2011  8:37PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cheating...  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Light-up-Dice-4-dice/dp/B0017K6XDA" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Light-up-Dice-4-dice/dp/B0017K6XDA</a><br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342023/#Comment_342023" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-08T23:25:58+00:00" title="September  8, 2011 11:25PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/zircher">@zircher</a><br/><br/>I like the resolution method (the beads, not the glowing led dice! ;-) How would you refresh the beads?<br/><br/>Also.. maybe fingers can be used for wagering, and some kind of prayer beads to keep count?<br/><br/>The trickling away of beads makes me think about the slow drifting into sleep.
