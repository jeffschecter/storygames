In other words, charging for the ideas, rather than the book as a product. I find this strange, and even a little offensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike, if you have a joke, should I pay you a quarter to hear it? Maybe it's just my hardcore belief that information is free, and not a commodity, no matter how hard folks try to turn it into one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I buy an RPG, in my head, I'm paying for the book itself. I'm sure as hell not paying for the ideas in the game. If someone wanted to charge me so that they could verbally relay the rules of their game, I'd probably tell them to do something rude and almost certainly physically impossible. Same would go if they wanted me to drop $40 for a photocopied page of rules, or a PDF.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've only written one game, so far. It's simple enough that you can play it once, then never need to reference the rules again. But I also think it provides an awesome gaming experience. Personally, I've never had anything worse than a "good" game using it, and I also used it to play my best gaming session ever. But because it's only available as a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/unistat.pdf" rel="nofollow">one-page PDF</a>, I don't charge for it. Even if I had a laminated, well-laid-out print version to sell, I'd probably only charge a few bucks for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all part of why I don't see any problem with PDF piracy. Basically, I don't think it's right to charge for PDFs in the first place. I know people do, but that doesn't mean I think it's right to do so. As an extension of this, I also think indie games are overpriced, with very few exceptions. In fact, the only one that comes to mind immediately is the first edition of Burning Wheel. Now, I understand that certain factors in small-press publication conflict with this. And that's fine; pragmatism will trump idealism every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this means for me is that if I sell a game in a physical book, I'll probably be selling it at a price equal to its production cost, plus a small amount to improve future products, then rounded up to the next convenient five-dollar increment. And electronic versions would be free.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this means for others is up to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that's where I'm coming from on this. What I'd like to hear are opinions, both from people who agree and those who don't. Really, this is just something I want to discuss, and maybe learn something from.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61435/#Comment_61435" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T13:28:58+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  1:28PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a disagreeing opinion.<br><br>I pay for novels based on the ideas and specific execution, including, say, plot twists, character moments, and so on.  But I don't pay people for telling me their novel ideas.  So I think paying for an RPG with good, well-executed ideas is just fine.<br><br>Secondly, this is a market-based deal.  People charge as much as is profitable without turning off too many customers.  We might be hippie players, but that doesn't mean we're hippies as self-publishers.  There's nothing wrong with charging for RPG ideas in PDF form and being able to pay off part of the family's credit cards with the proceeds.<br><br>That said, I'm sure I could have charged more for my game to maximize profits, but for me personally, getting it into more hands was worth more.

I think I put enough modifiers in here to indicate that this is very much just my current point of view, not fully thought out or articulated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Christian</b>: On buying a book, would you also feel comfortable with paying to read a book, as opposed to owning one? Should libraries charge you to borrow a book?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the business end of things, I understand that people do this. I'm not talking about whether it happens or is workable, but whether it is right to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Jason</b>: In a sense, yes, I'm saying that your ideas have no direct monetary value. That's not to say that they're not good, or fun, or important. But I'm not going to pay you for them directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I can play the Roach a few times, copy down the important bits, make my own cards, and play it without buying it. I can use your ideas without your product. You can't force me to pay you for the ideas, is what I'm saying. So if it's not the ideas I'm buying, then it must be the product, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe matter of electronic documents might need its own thread, but basically the difference is that you lose nothing, if someone pirates a copy of your game. If you steal my car, then I don't have a car. If you take a picture of my car, or somehow magically make a copy of it, I still have my car. No harm was done to me in the latter case.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Brian</b>: Again, I'm not addressing whether it is doable or not. I know it is. And I'm not disputing that the price should cover more than the printing costs. Just that "ideas" shouldn't have a cost added on to all the other costs of production.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the artwork, the cost of an original piece takes into consideration the fact that it was actually created by the artist. Prints cost less. Me going into a gallery and taking a photo of it (or looking at it in the gallery) costs nothing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61443/#Comment_61443" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T14:22:26+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  2:22PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2007 2:25PM by tj333.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My point of view is that the ideas are the most valuable part of the book.

I only recently bought TSOY after playing the hell out of it for a year (sorry, Clinton).  My point is that I eventually did buy a copy - even though by your logic I didn't need to.  Why?  Beyond the improvement having a physical copy brings to the table, because it is a good game and I want to support it, and its creator.  Why did I buy a copy of Primitive at Gen Con (which, by your product-only based assessment, was crazy expensive)?  I liked what Kevin was attempting and wanted to tell him in a tangible way that I thought it is worthwhile.  Again, I could have gone home and played Primitive without buying a copy - the game is very straightforward.  And maybe Kevin would pick a new hobby, who knows?<br><br>I think you're way off with the "I don't lose anything" angle for electronic content.  I lose a potential sale (the guys who stole it were interested enough to take it; maybe a few of them would have paid for it - we can ask Jake Richmond about this).  And worse, my "free" product is in the hands of someone who considers it worthless.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61455/#Comment_61455" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T15:59:09+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  3:59PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Andrew, what you'd really like is a shelf full of lots of pretty covers full of blank pages, which would be slightly cheaper without the necessity of paying those pesky writers?<br><br>"I choose not to make money from my game, therefore everyone who does is a bad person"?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61458/#Comment_61458" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T16:33:10+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  4:33PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that information should be free, but it seems really strange to me that you call a book or and rpg "information".  It is not, if not in the most mechanical ("a lot of bits") sense. It's like saying that the Venus of Milo shound be sold at the price of the material, because the work of Milo is "information" and should be free.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the first person who said "information should be free" had in mind something other than copying a DVD of an Hollywood movie. The informations that should be free are informations that we have the right to know but someone is working to avoid it.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing these words for something that didn't exist until someone worked to create them as a work of art (or craft) is another thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am saying that the "ideas" in a game rules pdf should cost a lot money? Hell, no. Ideas are worthless. Everybody has a lot of them. Almost all of them are rubbish, and finding the ones thast works, and how to make them works, it's a lot of... work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want to do all this work, so I pay a game designer to make all this work (desihgn, playtesting, and all that) for me.

I'll have to think about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nLate fees and donations aren't a cost to read the books. You can read them without ever paying those.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Christian</b>: Hey, man, no worries, I'm having difficulty understanding your point of view as well. So let me ask, if two books are equally awesome, and one is 40 pages long, and the other is 400 pages long, do you think they should be the same price? I don't want to put you in the position of saying that the ideas should be the only consideration in pricing, but that's what I'm getting from your posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying that work shouldn't be a factor in pricing. People keep going back to that, but that's simply not part of what I'm saying. Nor is it what I'm looking to discuss here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your desire to support a designer, that's also something else. You can always become a patron of the arts and donate to artists you think deserve it. That has nothing to do with the issue of whether it's right to charge for the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Jason</b>: I don't get what you mean with your TSOY example. If you wanted to support the designer, great. Do you think you would have been stealing from Clinton by not buying it, though?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Primitive, I don't really know the game well enough to comment, but I think it's rather the other way around. Kevin was selling it for $10, right? For a hand-made, aesthically pleasing book, that seems low to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, the electronic stuff might need another thread. This one is already sprawling about a bit. But a potential loss is a far cry from a real loss.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Tim</b>: I have several journals and sketch books with very pretty covers full of blank pages. I paid even more for them than the latest volume in my favorite series, because that was a paperback. This actually serves to illustrate my point -- the product is what I bought, not any ideas in it. What I would like is free or cheap (TJ's comments have me currently rethinking my beliefs on PDFs) electronic versions of the books I read, with just a few books on my shelf that I like as objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your quoted comment, I don't know where you're getting that from. I never said anything about a desire to make money off a game making someone a bad person. People I like do things I don't agree with all the time, and I don't think this makes them bad people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Moreno</b>: I never said things should be sold at cost. I said designers should be selling the product, not the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Everyone</b>: I'm not sure I've communicated my ideas clearly, so I'm gonna take a day and think it over. I'll post a clarification Monday night (hopefully), so I won't be commenting until then.

Or at least can be. It's unlikely that most people who want to play one of these games will have a chance to play it with the person who designed it, so to experience this art you need to buy  a copy of the product. Note the product, much like the frame of a painting or the shelf a sculpture sits on, isn't the art. It's the ideas and concepts created and shown inside the product. When you buy a Story Game you are paying an artist for their art. You're not buying the original paper that the ideas were written upon, but thats okay. Those papers are just a physical artifact that has little to do with the art itself. The art is the ideas, not the package.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you are advocating here is stealing art. Or, if we want to be more genial about it, not paying tribute to the artist but continuing to enjoy his work. Most of us aren'tcreating these games as public art fixtures to be seen and enjoyed by everyone. Rather, if you want to experience these games you (or someone you know) has to pay the price of admission. That price is set by the designer, and if you think these games are worth playing then you should feel obligated to pay that price. If you want to play a game but don't want to pay the price the games designer is asking then you are stealing the game.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I think you're way off with the "I don't lose anything" angle for electronic content. I lose a potential sale (the guys who stole it were interested enough to take it; maybe a few of them would have paid for it - we can ask Jake Richmond about this). And worse, my "free" product is in the hands of someone who considers it worthless.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSomeone said my name.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason is right. You absolutely lose potential sales. Shortly after it's release the PDF version of Panty Explosion (which I sell on my site for $10) popped up on dozens of file sharing sites and over the coarse of a few weeks was downloaded a few thousand people (or so these sites claim). At the same time the incredibly steady Panty explosion sales took an extreme nose dive. I received dozens of emails from people on RPG.net, the Forge, here at Story Games and other sites warning me that they had just downloaded a full version of my game and it was available for anyone who wanted it. i quickly contacted the sites and convinced most of them to take down the file and replace it with a tryout version of the game with info on how to buy the full version at my site. I also raised the issue on several gaming forums and became very vocal about the fact that I felt I was losing sales. Within a week sales of Panty explosion recovered, traffic to my website from the file sharing sites hosting the tryout kit shot through the roof and I received email after email of people apologizing for downloadimng the file illegally and offering to pay for a full version.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with making your game available for free in any format. But if you are charging for your game and someone is taking it without paying then that is theft. You are absolutely losing a potential sale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61467/#Comment_61467" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T17:46:57+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  5:46PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why do you think that when something's electronic it's suddenly nothing but ideas?<br><br>What <i>are</i> you trying to say here?

People are allocated abstract resources which they spend, as Matt says, on food and rent. The quantity of resources you are allocated is based on the value a market places on your contributions to society. An "information should be free" position effectively states that information producers should not be allocated resources. Surely that is not a desirable state of affairs?<br/>\n<br/>\nI probably wouldn't pay for an idea e.g. "a game about ninja mongeese who hunt werewolves". But I might pay for a game whose author has taken that idea and spent time and effort processing it into a form which is useful and appealing to me.

Sometimes sold for hundreds of dollars and listed on amazon.co.uk for \xc2\xa3112 ($225). Would I buy it at that price? Certainly not. Will others? Oh yes. There are some games I've bought recently where I felt there wasn't much "content" other than "ideas". The books, as books alone, were overpriced, but the ideas and the writing were very valuable. An example is Conspiracy - very slim book, but I love it and I'm glad I paid for it. Would I have paid more, sure. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Joel On Software has an article on software pricing which is pretty much the same market. The ideal price for the producer is exactly the highest price the buyer will pay. The ideal price for the buyer is the lowest price the producer will sell for. These two prices are very seldom the same and finding the balance is a complex process. Selling something for $2 might actually bring in less sales than selling the same thing for $7. I've seen it happen. As a seller you have to create value in the product and attach value to the product by not selling it for less than the market worth.<br/><br/>This is a really complex/lengthy subject that I'm interested in as a service provider (my co), a software developer (my co) and a RPG writer (myself).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61506/#Comment_61506" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T07:07:07+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  7:07AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are ideas free? Hum... They certainly can be copied. As long as you don't use someone's exact words I guess it isn't plagarism. Plagarism is the sincerest for of flattery. As a game designer any idea of mine that is picked up by someone else has snared that person's labor (at least their word of mouth labor). But in the end it still sticks in my claw.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started work on my game project 20 years ago. Like everyone else I thought it was good and wanted people to play. I didn't value my words highly and was perfectly okay with people "stealing" them for their own use. I viewed their doing so as spreading the word. The cost of spreading ideas was a stumbling block. There was no internet, printing was very expensive, and word of mouth ineffective. I knew that I had to transfer the costs on to the end user as much as possible. So I wrote magazine articles (readers paid a subscription) ran a newsletter (sold at cost), and ran convention games (I was there anyway so it was free - but we all paid to get in the door). That grass roots campaign cost money. I figured it out a few years ago at minimum wage and determined I had put in $100,000 in unpaid labor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd kind of like to get paid for that investment of time at somepoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real trouble with free floating ideas is that they are not valued. My stuff has been around a long time and is known - but it hasn't had the impact of other games. A nicely made artifact does do something for the legitimacy (at least in terms of public perception) an idea has. At the end of the day we are paid for our products rather than our ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nPDFs are a funky thing in my thinking. People think they are cheaper but in fact all they do is transfer the production costs to the end user. What they end up with is a poorly bound paperback. I'm selling this way now but I can't say they I understand why people buy them. I guess I'm just old.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get my rules for free on my web page. You can write your own version of the Matrix Game (I encourage that). But if you copy my words or photocopy my product without paying me then you are a thief and a dirty dog. You'll likely get away with it but let that be on your conscience. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61513/#Comment_61513" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T08:22:37+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  8:22AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;Anyway, that's where I'm coming from on this.

I didn't want to wait for the game to get to me via the vagaries of USPS. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I wanted it the same day .</span><br/><br/>Now, John Wick of Wicked Dead Press gets around this by offering print, pdf and print+pdf options. If I recall correctly, he also allows for a pdf purchase with later upgrade+upcharge to print if you really like the thing.<br/><br/>Me, I think that's a good approach.<br/><br/>Other reasons: <br/>1) Old stuff back in print<br/>OOP games can be picked up usually at half or less of the original coverprice. There's no particularly good reason for a company to keep certain low selling games in print. The do have some good reasons for making the same stuff cheaply available as pdf. For example, when I hit a bout of nostalgia, I can pop over to Paizo or one of the other pdf sites and pick up an old '80s-something game for next to nothing. No hunting on e-bay or used book sites. No bidding wars for a crappy beat up copy.<br/><br/>2) Satisfy my curiosity<br/>This sort of goes along with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but is slightly different. For example, I'd heard a ton of stuff about WW's Adventure! Now I love me some Pulp, but I had no urge to pay cover price to see if I'd like that particular game. I also didn't want to hunt it down since it was OOP. At $12 though, I was willing to look it over. Ditto the New WoD rules. WW put them up for free for October a year or so ago. I checked them out, and ended up buying the new Vampire, just for the heck of it. I wouldn't have done that had they not offered a free or very cheap pdf that I could look over first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61526/#Comment_61526" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T09:12:24+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  9:12AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll just add my voice.<br/><br/>Let's say I wrote a novel.<br/><br/>Rather than go through the dead-tree-publishing maze, I decide to put it out as a PDF.<br/><br/>Given that it's a novel you want to read, and that it's (say) 50,000 words, what would you pay for the PDF?

Idea. <strong>Service</strong>. <strong>Experience</strong>.</p>\n<p>When Andrew raises the point "would you pay to read a library book?" he's really talking about charging for an <em>experience</em>. When Matt Johnston points out that we <em>do</em> pay for libraries, he's talking about a <em>service</em>. Both of these are different than the <em>product</em> (books that the library purchase) and the <em>ideas</em> contained therein (which I might summarize for someone to encourage them to read a particular book.)</p>\n<p>Now, I have read Thomas Jefferson's argument against copyright, where he claims that ideas are not property, because if someone copies an idea, the person who came up with the idea is not deprived of the idea. I agree with him, but I'm sure Jefferson didn't mean that products and services should have zero value. When a writer comes up with an idea ("A little girl walks through a mirror into a nonsense world where things are the opposite of the way she expects") and then performs a service (composing <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> as one expression of that idea,) I see no problem with paying the writer for the service he provides, or paying a bookstore for a copy of his composition, but I do see a problem with someone forbidding me from explaining the plot to my friend, or charging me for quoting my favorite moments. And, although I see no problem with a group of actors videotaping their humorous performance of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and selling the results of their service on a DVD, I definitely see a problem with the DVD distributor rigging the DVD to prevent repeated plays of the DVD unless I pay a fee to unlock the disc each time I want to experience it again.</p>\n<p>So, to apply these thoughts to PDF vs. print products: an RPG writer creates an idea and, as a service, composes text explaining that idea in an entertaining fashion. Even if the idea is a simple one that in theory anyone could do ("100 Famous Fictional Places for d20",) the writer is doing a service, in the form of research, arrangement, statting things out. I have no problem paying the writer for this service, even if I don't get a physical product in exchange for my money, as long as I feel the writer is charging a fair amount for that service. Opinions on what a "fair amount" is are going to vary, but I can't see myself paying any money at all for a PDF that's ten pages or less, because that's not a lot of work. I could do ten pages of work myself, easily, so why would I pay someone else? For longer PDFs that are still not as long as a physical book, I might pay $2-$5, if I feel that writer can do quality work. And, as it happens, this seems to be the typical price range of shorter PDFs, so other people must agree. $10-$15 is about right for a longer PDF.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61578/#Comment_61578" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T19:58:03+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  7:58PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me start this off by saying that I am disappointed by the lack of respect being shown in this thread. I posted this on Story Games because I wanted a friendly discussion of a topic that is important to me. While several of the posters have done this, and I certainly don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to dismiss their contributions, the negative comments I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve read have been disheartening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will try to clarify several things that people have apparently misinterpreted:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I have not said, nor do I believe, that things should be sold at cost.<br/>\n2. I have not said, nor do I believe, that costs other than printing shouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be included in the price of a product.<br/>\n3. I have not said, nor do I believe, that game designers shouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t make money off their games.<br/>\n4. I stated in my original post that my thoughts on electronic documents were not fully formed or tightly held. They are, at best, a side topic that is derailing this thread. If you want to talk about that, please start a new thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Jake</b>: While I feel your pain and respect your opinion, what you have shown is a correlation, not a cause-and-effect relationship. I could point to Baen Books offering products in a free online format, and their subsequent drastic increase in sales of those titles in print form. Again, this is just a correlation. There are too many factors to take into consideration to prove anything here. You have your belief, based on your experiences, and I have mine. I respectfully disagree with you, and I hope this doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t mean we can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t value each other\xe2\u20ac\u2122s opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, at no point have I advocated stealing. I have simply expressed my beliefs about how things should be priced, and why. If you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t agree with it, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s cool. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not telling you how to price your games. To be clear, I do believe that people should pay for things, but what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m addressing here is about pricing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the loss of \xe2\u20ac\u0153potential sales,\xe2\u20ac\x9d I disagree. You cannot show that you have lost sales you would otherwise have made. If I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t go to my regular poker game, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve potentially lost the money I could have won, but in fact, I haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t lost anything. On your case in particular, we can never know if your actions resulted in the bump in sales. Perhaps you would have had that boost anyway, as people who played the game and liked it enough went to your site and bought a copy. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not pointing this out to say that you are wrong, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m simply illustrating that we cannot prove it one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Colin</b>: Based on the more thoughtful comments here, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m currently rethinking my beliefs on electronic document pricing. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m still wrestling with the concept that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m paying for a thing that, technically speaking, does not exist in any physical way. Likening it to paying for a service makes it easier to accept, however. As in point 4 above, however, let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s please take any further discussion of this topic to another thread, so it doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t muddy the waters here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Judd</b>: I agree with your comments in your first post. As to what I want from this thread, I hope I explained that above. I just want to understand other viewpoints and express my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your second post, you ask about mainstream games that are overpriced, to my way of thinking. Pretty much all of them, the same as indie games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Andy</b>: I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know that that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s true, actually. It seems most people are arguing about work, rather than idea, as being part of the cost. This was never my point at all. I agree that work is part of the cost of a product. Maybe I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m misreading comments, but that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Matt Wilson</b>: I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d argue that you paid to see him perform his jokes live, not for the jokes directly. Maybe I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m wrong about that, and you\xe2\u20ac\u2122d have been as happy with transcript of the performance, or even watching the show on television. Let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Daniel</b>: I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what point you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re making, other than that perceived value is a factor in determining how much someone can charge for something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Joshua</b>: I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not saying what things should cost specifically. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s up to the seller. What I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m saying is that the calculation should be (production cost + profit = final price), rather than (production cost + value of my ideas + profit = final price). As I state in my points above, the production cost certainly includes things other than simply printing, which is what several people have incorrectly assumed I was saying. I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t think we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re actually disagreeing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Matt Johnston</b>: That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a fair point about libraries. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d agree that taxes are the same as directly paying a library for reading their books, though. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s more like taxes are the price you pay to a government for the service of providing a safe and orderly society, and libraries are just one of the benefits you get from that. However, if this would take away from the point, just change it to your local Barnes &amp; Noble store. I go in there all the time and read a chapter or two of a book before deciding if I want to buy it. No one has ever said I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d have to pay for that, or even commented that I was sitting and reading too long. They even give you a caf\xc3\xa9 so you can have something to eat and drink while you read. My girlfriend even reads whole books at their stores.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Steven</b>: If all they are producing is information, then yes, I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t feel they should be allocated resources. If they take that information and use it to create a product or service, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s another story. Which, basically, is the main point I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking about here. Like, the fact that someone is strong has no direct monetary value. But if they use their strength to move my furniture, then they\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve provided a service that does have monetary value. So, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not certain, but I think we agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Aaron</b>: Thank you for expressing your viewpoint. I was looking for stuff like this. Why do you feel that the games are under-priced?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Chris</b>: Nice post. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m familiar with your games and your story about marketing them and receiving attention. This is an great example of what I meant when I spoke about pragmatism trumping idealism. Personally, I really think it sucks that you haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t gotten more acclaim, recognition, and sales. Especially since your game is really one of the first of the \xe2\u20ac\u0153indie games\xe2\u20ac\x9d as we think of them now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Ryan</b>: I think you may have missed my point. I never said things like labor shouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be included in the pricing of a product. I have not overlooked the other costs involved; in fact, these are the things which I believe should be included in pricing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fred</b>: If I really wanted to read it (for example, if I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d enjoyed your previous works, and this one sounded as good), I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d probably pay whatever I could afford. But that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not the point I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking about here. Consumer willingness to pay has nothing to do with it. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a factor in real-world pricing, sure. If I have a canteen of water, and I find a guy suffering from dehydration, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m sure I could sell the water for a ridiculous price, because he wants it so much. That doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t make it right.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn your second post, please don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t put words into my mouth. As you can see from my response above, the answer is not zero.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Jason</b>: Good points about the utility of PDF versus print.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>John</b>: Awesome post, and very thought-provoking. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m exhausted from replying to everyone so far, so I can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really comment right now. But I think you have, indeed, hit on something. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m going to digest it for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61584/#Comment_61584" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T21:45:47+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  9:45PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, let me start by saying that I'm enjoying this conversation quite a bit.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">While I feel your pain and respect your opinion, what you have shown is a correlation, not a cause-and-effect relationship.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nYou are right in this. All I can do is offer my anecdotal evidence about my own experience. I think my case is pretty compelling. When the PDF became publicly available my sales disappeared. When the publicly available PDF was replaced by a demo PDF with a link to the site were you could buy the full version then my sales made a huge rebound. My site traffic at the time showed a huge amount of incoming traffic from file sharing sites that where hosting the demo version and had been hosting the full version. I certainly can't prove people stealing my game was causing my to lose sales, but I can prove that once the game was no longer available to steal my sales went back up. Of course, just because this was true for my game does not  mean it would be true for other games. But in this case I do believe this is what happened.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I could point to Baen Books offering products in a free online format, and their subsequent drastic increase in sales of those titles in print form.

But just so I know, since my belief is based on my experiences, what is yours based on? What is your counter here? Do you have experiences or anecdotal evidence or theory that you would like to share on this specific matter? If not, that's okay. You have said that the PDF issue wasn't one you were overly decided on. So if you don't want to talk about it now I won't press the issue anymore.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Also, at no point have I advocated stealing.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThis following bit here is the part that makes it sound like you are advocating stealing:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">For example, I can play the Roach a few times, copy down the important bits, make my own cards, and play it without buying it. I can use your ideas without your product. You can't force me to pay you for the ideas, is what I'm saying. So if it's not the ideas I'm buying, then it must be the product, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe matter of electronic documents might need its own thread, but basically the difference is that you lose nothing, if someone pirates a copy of your game. If you steal my car, then I don't have a car. If you take a picture of my car, or somehow magically make a copy of it, I still have my car. No harm was done to me in the latter case.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">If I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t go to my regular poker game, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve potentially lost the money I could have won, but in fact, I haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t lost anything.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nExcept the potential to win money. If someone is interested enough in my game to steal it, then they may be interested enough to buy it. This won't always be the case of course. Maybe only one out of 10 people who illegally downloaded Panty Explosion would really be interested enough in buying it. Maybe only 1 in 50. Those are still potential lost sales. Even if that were not the case, I DO NOT WANT PEOPLE DOWNLOADING MY GAME WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT! It belongs to me, and I have made the choice to sell it. You don't get to have a copy unless you pay for it. That's the deal. That's my choice.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">What I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m saying is that the calculation should be (production cost + profit = final price), rather than (production cost + value of my ideas + profit = final price).</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI don't think anyone prices their product in either of these ways, although I could be wrong. For me, the creative process is very much a part of the production process. Infact, the creative process, the act of thinking about the game for weeks and months and assembling it in my head, is much more work and takes much more time then the writing, playtesting, editing, layout, proof reading and all other aspects of putting a product together combined. matt and I spent 9 months working on Panty Explosion, but less then 30 days were spent actually writing the book. I can't speak for anyone else but myself I guess, but the idea is definitely the art. Everything else is just the frame. When you buy one of my games what you are getting is the physical manifestation of the idea.

I agree, ideas should for the most part be free (Patents of limited duration being acceptible to protect some ideas merely so the cost of development can be justified so the world might actually get to use the idea in a material way). However, "a bunch of make believe characters in a fantasy setting go off and have adventures, explore dungeons and slay monster and bad guys and get rewarded with extra skills, powers and money" is the basic idea behind D&amp;D (and numerous other RPGs). That idea is certainly free and after thumbing through a copy of Dungeons &amp; Dragons on a shelf to get the gist of the idea there would be absolutely nothing wrong with going home and taking that idea and doing with it what you will. However, the idea at its core is rather simple and not worth much. Even really novel or innovative ideas themselves, even those that launch multi billion dollar industries, are at best the just the potential for something. It is the application of the idea that becomes worth something. It is the application of the idea that people pay for. So in your example of that one game, if you like the basic premise of the game and even its mix of game + cards, you could take that idea and go make your own game based on that idea. But when you talk of writing down what the creator had put on the actual cards, that crossed over into stealing his intellectual propety. Stealing his application of the idea, or portions thereof.<br>\n<br>\n&gt;&gt;On the loss of \xe2\u20ac\u0153potential sales,\xe2\u20ac\x9d I disagree. You cannot show that you have lost sales you would otherwise have made.&gt;In your second post, you ask about mainstream games that are overpriced, to my way of thinking. Pretty much all of them, the same as indie games.&gt;What I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m saying is that the calculation should be (production cost + profit = final price), rather than (production cost + value of my ideas + profit = final price).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61619/#Comment_61619" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-20T10:20:50+00:00" title="March 20, 2007 10:20AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;If all they are producing is information, then yes, I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t feel they should be allocated resources.

However, since you acknowledge the role of profit in pricing, and we're really just talking about <b>how much</b> profit you sell it for then we're in pretty fuzzy territory, especially since you describe a very wide swath of products as "overpriced".<br><br>From here, this looks like there is some number that you consider an ok level of profit, but I have no sense of what that number may be, or how you arrived at it.  I admit, it would be pretty useful to have such a yardstick since it would allow us to point to the specifics and separate an impression from an analysis.  This isn't meant as a dig.  It's just that I think you're trying to say something more substantial than "RPGs are priced higher than I want them to be" and I'm trying to figure out what that is.<br><br>Specifically, what about this objection is specific to RPGs as opposed to any other form of media?  <br><br>Just to illustrate,  take art -  why I'm paying for more than paint, canvas, and an hourly wage?

Same idea. Different product. Both awesome.<br><br>Andrew, if I came off as going after you, I apologize. I've been trying to deal with this sort of thing for too long (How do you convince a 14 year old that it's wrong to bootleg music and movies when the producers of same treat all their customers like thieves and mistreat the talent, while releasing products of marginal quality??) <br><br>It seems that one of the things that makes you uncomfortable is that you're paying money for something that doesn't 'exist' in the real world. With DRM-free products, I find it the opposite. I can burn it to a compact disc, keep a copy on my thumbdrive, or even print out and make a bound copy of the book. If the object wears out, I can just make another copy. If the object doesn't make sense for a particular application, I can put it in a different form. As a bonus, I get it right away, and it can't be out of stock. It's more work to get a table copy, but I'm okay with that. <br><br>As far as my point goes, this whole thing is sort of a hot button issue with me, I tend to rant (an example of the value of ideas vs. presentation of the ideas in a digestible form I suppose). For me, it was more a response to your post turning into something about copyright infringement. I get tweaked when people don't respect a creators wishes about the distribution of their work.<br><br>That said, I hate it when a person who holds the copyright for a work equates copyright infringement with theft. Assuming that the person doesn't share the game, the most harm that was done to the copyright holder is that they lost the potential to sell that product to that person. If I take a $20 pdf, it is not the same as me reaching into your wallet and taking a $20 bill. I am still harming you, and I'm breaking the law, but I'm not stealing. I could decide that your product isn't for me, and the harm to the creator is <em>the same</em>. Posting a bootleg pdf on the internet would hurt you more of course, but it's still not theft. Copyright is there to make sure that the copyright holder gets to set the terms of the work's distribution.<br><br>If property rights applied to ideas (by ideas, I'm referring to anything that could be trademarked, patented, or copyrighted), then we wouldn't need any trademark, patent, or copyright law. To pretend that they are the same thing does everyone a disservice, and only confuses an already complex issue.<br><br>Woah, I seem to be ranting again. <br><br>I think that some products are underpriced, and some products are overpriced, and it depends on the person buying the product. (I think that everything that Games Workshop is overpriced, but the last time I was at my FLGS, I saw a guy happily drop $300 on an army. We clearly disagree on the value of GW's products.) <br><br>And that's okay.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61640/#Comment_61640" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-20T14:10:35+00:00" title="March 20, 2007  2:10PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andrew Morris</cite><strong>Matt Wilson</strong>: I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d argue that you paid to see him perform his jokes live, not for the jokes directly.

I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll happily jump in on a thread if someone else wants to continue that part of this discussion, but for now, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m sticking to the main point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only have three free hours each day, and I spent all of them yesterday reading, considering, and responding as fully as I was able. I really don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to do that again today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Jake</b>: As stated, let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s continue the talk about electronic products in another thread, if you\xe2\u20ac\u2122d like. Maybe in a day or two? I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve already gotten some great opinions and viewpoints, and as I said, things are still mixing about in my head on this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of the problem I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m having conveying what\xe2\u20ac\u2122s in my head is that what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking about is abstract, rather than concrete. Coupled with the fact that online is a terrible format for such discussions, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising that this is so difficult to convey. Of the people I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve spoken to about this topic face to face, it only takes a few minutes to get my point across, whether they agree with it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say, <i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153When you buy one of my games what you are getting is the physical manifestation of the idea.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i> I agree with that. I am buying the physical object, not the idea. Obviously one is the result of applying the other. But if you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re saying I have to pay for the right to access that idea, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s simply crazy to me. No one has the power or the right to charge me for receiving ideas. For clarification, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking \xe2\u20ac\u0153moral right,\xe2\u20ac\x9d not \xe2\u20ac\u0153legal right.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153You are saying that if someone takes their idea and turns it into a product then it is worth allocating resources to them. But earlier you said that the idea itself shouldn't be considered in the final value of the product. \xe2\u20ac\xa6 How do you reconcile these two points?

I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t see any conflict between those points, personally. Taking an idea and turning that into a product is work. Work is something that, unlike an idea, <i>does</i> have a direct monetary value. That value is calculated into the cost of the product. Again, the product is what I am paying for, not the idea. Certainly you couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have created the same product without that idea. Still, you are buying the product of their work, not their ideas. In the same way that you are not buying the strength of a mover, just the service of moving furniture.<br/>\n<br/>\n(More to come)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61661/#Comment_61661" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-20T20:00:13+00:00" title="March 20, 2007  8:00PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Ryan</b>: You say, <i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153It is the application of the idea that becomes worth something.

But the legal aspect, as I mention, is not what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking about here. This is more philosophy than real-world pragmatism. If me copying something down for my own use is illegal, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m shocked to discover that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s how the law is worded, and I find that unpleasant in the extreme. Is it the act of writing it down that is illegal? Like, if I have perfect recall, and I memorize a book, is that also illegal? I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not being flippant here, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m actually curious.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153We get it. You don't really assign the same value to the work/design creation process that the market that actually spends money on such games does.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i><br/>\n<br/>\nNot at all. I <i>am</i> a part of that market. I have spent quite a bit of money on RPG books. I do value the work that goes into making games. That is part of what I am paying for when I buy an RPG book.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say, <i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153And I thought the same as you, that designing games was easy.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i> I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t think that at all. I do not dismiss or fail to recognize the hard work that you and others do as full-time game designers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153Only after an idea has been practically applied does it begin to have value. How much value will depend on how useful the original idea was coupled with the work that went into its development and utility value of the final presentation.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI think this quote is particularly useful, since it seems to highlight the difference in our opinions, and I agree with many of your other statements. My point of view is that the idea still doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have monetary value \xe2\u20ac\u201c the application of it does. Maybe we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re coming to the same conclusions through different paths, since in practice, there is little difference at the end of the line \xe2\u20ac\u201c we both think the product has value, I believe. Perhaps we simply see that value as coming from different places.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn your comment that I have overlooked part of the equation, that is inaccurate. I simply include all of those in \xe2\u20ac\u0153production cost\xe2\u20ac\x9d as in \xe2\u20ac\u0153all costs associated with production\xe2\u20ac\x9d for the sake of convenience. This includes the factors you list: marketing, time, warehousing, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t address your second post fully, without delving into the matter of electronic documents, but I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll try to address the general point. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not saying that there is pure source of information or anything sweeping like that. What I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m saying is that it is the \xe2\u20ac\u0153value add,\xe2\u20ac\x9d as you put it, that has the monetary worth. Quite literally, you are adding monetary value to something that has none on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Rob</b>: Yeah, I totally agree that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fuzzy territory. In fact, it can be difficult or impossible as a consumer to determine the truth of the matter. But I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m just going from statements I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve heard designers make in the past \xe2\u20ac\u201c that the idea is what you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re paying for, rather than the book, which is just a necessary device for containing the idea, rather than my position, that it is the book that gives any value at all to \xe2\u20ac\u0153idea + book.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>\xe2\u20ac\x9d Specifically, what about this objection is specific to RPGs as opposed to any other form of media?\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIt\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not necessarily specific to RPGs as opposed to other media. RPGs are just the ones I care about and want to discuss, is all. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s also not a specific price point that I have a problem with. I realize I conveyed that badly. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s probably because, as I stated in my first post, this is something I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been thinking about, and wanted to learn more about. In fact, this discussion has helped me identify the core of the issue. And it really is an ideological thing. So I posted things that I sorta-kinda recant. Like the comment about overpricing. The actual price tag, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve realized, has little to do with that viewpoint. A $100 RPG that doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t include the idea as part of the pricing is fine, while a $1 RPG that does, isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t. So certainly a good portion of the confusing, sprawling nature of this thread has to do with the fact that (in my head), I was saying \xe2\u20ac\u0153hey, here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a thought\xe2\u20ac\xa6let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s talk about it\xe2\u20ac\x9d while giving that impression that I was saying \xe2\u20ac\u0153here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s my manifesto and anyone who doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t conform is evil!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fred</b>: I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not talking about anything to do with that movement. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m putting forward my idea and asking to discuss it, not putting forward a doctrine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Daniel</b>: Again, the electronic document stuff would be great in another thread, and I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll happily contribute there, if someone wants to start it. Especially since you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got some stuff in there I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d love to discuss. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m forcing myself to keep this thread on topic, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to whether those movies are the same idea, I guess it really depends on the scale, in a sense. From a high-level viewpoint, certainly they are the same idea. From a close-up viewpoint, no, they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re not.  At the high level, they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re both, \xe2\u20ac\u0153fighter comes to a town in crisis,\xe2\u20ac\x9d closer up they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re \xe2\u20ac\u0153fighter enters a town being torn apart by a feud,\xe2\u20ac\x9d and closer still, they differ in the specifics of what happens and the aftermath of that \xe2\u20ac\u201c one is \xe2\u20ac\u0153fighter uses feud for his own purposes\xe2\u20ac\x9d and the other is \xe2\u20ac\u0153fighter attempts to end the feud.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Matt Wilson</b>: Right, as my previous responses have hopefully shown, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not saying products should be sold at cost.

Going through all of this can be draining, I know.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">You say, \xe2\u20ac\u0153When you buy one of my games what you are getting is the physical manifestation of the idea.\xe2\u20ac\x9d I agree with that. I am buying the physical object, not the idea. Obviously one is the result of applying the other. But if you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re saying I have to pay for the right to access that idea, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s simply crazy to me. No one has the power or the right to charge me for receiving ideas. For clarification, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking \xe2\u20ac\u0153moral right,\xe2\u20ac\x9d not \xe2\u20ac\u0153legal right.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI disagree. I had an idea, which I manifested in the form of a 96 page game called Panty Explosion. I've decided that the only way I want to share that idea is by charging people $20.00 for a copy of the book. The book itself is not the idea, just the vessel that contains it. When you buy the book you get the paper, the ink, the glue and the idea. For me the idea is the part of that that is worthwhile. Do you really disagree?<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Taking an idea and turning that into a product is work. Work is something that, unlike an idea, does have a direct monetary value. That value is calculated into the cost of the product. Again, the product is what I am paying for, not the idea.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAgain, I disagree. I think you are mistaking the frame for the painting. Or more accurately, admiring the finished product without being able to acknowledge all the work that went into it. I don't know how it is for you, but for m generating the ideas that resulted in the finished versions of my game were a lot of work. Much more work then the typing, layout and printing. As I said before, Matt and myself spent 9 months developing Panty explosion, and 7 of those were just talking about the game and developing it as an idea. For me game creation is largely a mental process. I think about a game for weeks or months, I develop it as an idea, and once I think it's complete I type it up and test it. This always leads to another long round of thinking about the ideas and developing them in my head. The playtesting, typing, editing and other aspects of a games development are a very small percentage of the work compared to the time spent thinking about and developing the ideas. Which is real work. Hard work. My ideas are developed and refined through a process of hard work before they ever are translated to a physical artifact. The idea is the work. Even if that is not true for anyone else, it is certainly true for me.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Certainly you couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have created the same product without that idea. Still, you are buying the product of their work, not their ideas.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe ideas ARE the product of work. Besides, ithout the ideas the product is worthless. Random words on a page. Random paint on a canvas. If you are interested in purchasing a copy of Panty Explosion "without the ideas" I will gladly sell you a blank 96 page book at cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61672/#Comment_61672" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-20T22:21:12+00:00" title="March 20, 2007 10:21PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, I see what you're saying.<br><br>And I'm not sure that I agree, but I'm definitely seeing the basis for it.

It's the EXPRESSION that's hard work, that has value, not the IDEA.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nFred, I think what you are refering to as the "expression of ideas" is what I'm refering to as simply "ideas". But maybe I'm wrong. When I say "ideas" I'm refering to the entire mental creative process that for me is 90% of the work. I'm refering to the full development of the game that happens in my head before I ever touch the keyboard. I'm refering to the months of hard thought and the carefully worded paragraphs that I store in my brain before I ever start to transcribe them onto paper. This reprresents way, way more effort and work then any typing, playtesting or publishing stuff. And it's all ideas. Every bit of it. It seems to me that Andrew is saying that this is the part that is unimportant, and I just don't agree.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">You guys keep saying that ideas (and by that I mean "seed ideas", the ideas that form the foundation for work) have value, and that may be so, but not much.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nCertainly "idea seeds" are only valuable if you do something with them. "Psychic Japanese schoolgirl panty game" is not in and of itself a very good idea. The ideas that sprang from that have proven to be very worthwhile. "Mormon law enforcers in an old west that never was" isn't a real gem either, but the ideas that came out of it certainly were. Those ideas had to exsist before these games could exsist. One idea built upon another until there was a complete game. You can't dismiss the ideas that went into the game because in a very real sense the game is nothing BUT ideas! It seems like Andrew is trying to argue that it's only the last few steps of the development, the physical steps once the ideas are already in place, that are worthwhile. But I may be wrong. Andrew, feel free to correct me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61684/#Comment_61684" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-21T05:23:50+00:00" title="March 21, 2007  5:23AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading over my posts I realize I'm just argueing the same points over and over again.

If I don't, I don't. <br><br>If overall enough consumers find the value to be worth the price, the book makes a return, if not, then not.<br><br>It's as simple as that surely.  Underpriced, overpriced, these are in a sense meaningless concepts on their own.  The real question is whether a given game is priced at a point which generates sufficient sales to be worth the author's time, and then different authors come to different views on that.<br><br>Otherwise, ideas have relatively little value in themselves, it's the execution.  When we buy a game book we buy an execution of an idea, we may if it matters to us and the choice is available pay a premium in order to have that execution expressed in hardcopy rather than pdf or whatever, but the core element is the executed idea.  Edit:  And to be clear, I don't mean simply the physical vessel containing the idea, I mean the means in which conceptually that idea is realised as a playable game or scenario or whatever.  The PCs go in a hole, kill some orcs and take phat loot is an idea.  A scenario containing maps, encounters, treasure tables and so on is an execution of that idea, the book all that is printed in is the physical manifestation of that execution.  Separating them is pretty artificial, but essentially the book is a delivery mechanism for that particular execution.<br/><br/>In fact, many indie games are available both in pdf form and in hardcopy, where so the price differential between the two is the assumed value of the physical object as opposed to the ideas contained within it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61688/#Comment_61688" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-21T05:58:28+00:00" title="March 21, 2007  5:58AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On that note, I should point out that most of the bigger book publishers price their ebooks at the same price point as their hardcovers, until the paperback comes out, at which point it drops to the price of the paperback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61724/#Comment_61724" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-21T11:08:11+00:00" title="March 21, 2007 11:08AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The recent posts have got me thinking about the idea "value added"<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas are dime a dozen - So my raw idea is worth less than a penny. If a product had say 100 ideas it might be worth a dollar (at that rate). But take those hundred ideas and house them in a book (a physical artifact that can be referreed to again and again) and value is added. If game design takes a lot of time, does that add value? It certain has opportunity costs for the designer but that alone does not mean value.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe notion that ideas are or should be free is idealistic. Personally I think it is incorrect. We share ideas to communicate - getting respect like was mentioned above. While I would hate to reduce everything to market terms - time and energy are market terms. Everyone reading this thread is "spending" their time. But are we adding value by doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublishers publish for profit. It is a business plan and simple. They take raw ideas and add value to them by putting them together well and then peddle the end item to the public. Could the public have made the item themselves? Probably. Could they have made it as good? Probably not. <br/>\n<br/>\nI ran a thread over on the Forge entitled "Presentation is important" to mimic the idea that system is important. The thread didn't go long or product much but for an idea to prosper it really does need an effective value added delivery system. Once a person crosses the line between communicating to selling an idea it is about money. Taking from that person hurts their livelyhood. I don't believe idealism stands up well to this kind of challenge. If I was on a jury deciding a case like this - I'm afraid I'd be on the side supporting property rights. Otherwise we are shitting on those who add value.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting that the hacker ethos of free ideas is not more supported here. Maybe we are all too close to being owners?<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61725/#Comment_61725" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-21T11:14:49+00:00" title="March 21, 2007 11:14AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the hacker ethic of free ideas is DEFINITELY supported here... many of us share our ideas for the express purpose that they will be taken, improved, and put back into the community for the benefit of all.

I'm not going to read the entire thing, but here's my reaction to Andrew's initial post:<br/><br/>There's a fundamental flaw in your argument.  To make sure that I get it straight, I'm going to go back over a few points.<br/><br/>Games come in two forms: physical and electronic.  When you buy a physical copy of the book, you're paying for the atoms that comprise the book.  When you're buying an electronic copy, since there are no atoms, there's no monetary value.  <br/><br/>When you buy a game, I agree - you're buying the rules.  The rules, the concepts that comprise the game, are essentially valueless.  However, you're not paying for the rules themselves - you're paying <i>to be taught</i> the concept.  It's not the idea - it's the transmission of the idea from the creator to you that you're really paying for.  The creator of the work arranged some novel collection of concepts, rules and 'color', and you're paying to have that unique collection transmitted to you.<br/><br/>This transmission can occur in one of three ways (currently, anyways): physical, electronic or personal (being taught directly).  None are inherently less valuable - simply different forms.<br/><br/>While I think you can argue that charging the same amount for a PDF (which doesn't have printing costs associated with it) as a physical book is problematic is one thing.  But you're arguing something else entirely, based on a false assumption about what it is you're actually paying for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61784/#Comment_61784" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-21T21:48:36+00:00" title="March 21, 2007  9:48PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Jake</b>: Okay, cool. I think we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve reached the point of understanding that we each have a different view on this. Just to be sure, though, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll answer your first question, because it seems to show our different opinions. Yes, I really do disagree, and that seems to be the foundation of our different viewpoints. I think the idea has no monetary value (and please note that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m speaking solely of direct monetary worth, not any other kind of \xe2\u20ac\u0153value\xe2\u20ac\x9d or significance), but the book does. If I understand you correctly, you feel that the idea has monetary value, and the book is just the carrier for that idea, and thus has no (or at least, less) monetary value. Is that about right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153Again, I disagree. I think you are mistaking the frame for the painting. Or more accurately, admiring the finished product without being able to acknowledge all the work that went into it. I don't know how it is for you, but for m generating the ideas that resulted in the finished versions of my game were a lot of work.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i><br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I certainly recognize the hard work that goes into developing, applying, and testing games. I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t consider any of that to be part of the idea, though. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s part of the work that goes into creating the product.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>\xe2\u20ac\x9d My ideas are developed and refined through a process of hard work before they ever are translated to a physical artifact. The idea is the work.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i><br/>\n<br/>\nSee, this is bit confusing for me. Because I totally agree with the first sentence. In fact, that work is what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m paying for \xe2\u20ac\u201c the application of the idea. But then you say that the idea is the work, and I just don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t understand that. The idea was refined and turned into a product through hard work, certainly. Have I misunderstood you here?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m starting to feel the same as you; that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m just repeating myself here. But hopefully in restating my thoughts in different ways, I might hit upon an explanation that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s more easily understood, even for those who disagree, so at least can we make sure we understand each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>\xe2\u20ac\x9d When I say "ideas" I'm refering to the entire mental creative process that for me is 90% of the work.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOh. Well, yeah, then this is clearly part of it, because I am most definitely <b>not</b> referring to all that as part of the \xe2\u20ac\u0153idea.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>\xe2\u20ac\x9d It seems like Andrew is trying to argue that it's only the last few steps of the development, the physical steps once the ideas are already in place, that are worthwhile. But I may be wrong. Andrew, feel free to correct me.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThat\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not at all what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m saying, Jake.

And if you want to call me from Canada to hear out your ideas, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll absolutely listen to them\xe2\u20ac\xa6unless you call collect, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fred</b>: Yeah, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m saying, for the most part, though I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d say that the ideas have no value instead of \xe2\u20ac\u0153not much.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Max</b>: I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not talking about the practicalities of economics here.

Essentially, it becomes a moral justification for taking IP without payment or consent.  I think in essence, that's what the argument here boils down to, and it's why it can be misleading to talk of how things should be without reference to how things are, because then acts which makes things as they should be are acts which help make the actual more like the ideal.<br><br>Put another way, it's sophistry, an argument which justifies taking other people's work without paying for it as in some postulated ideal world they would not ask for payment.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61805/#Comment_61805" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T06:50:13+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  6:50AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61809/#Comment_61809" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T07:28:23+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  7:28AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2007 7:28AM by Clinton.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>This is a super-long thread that is slightly nutso.

Power is wealth. I am super-wealthy by the standards of about 80% of the world, and pretty middle-class for my own super-insane-wealthy nation. Let's assume about 85% of the people in the world are not as wealthy. Role-playing games are information.

The right price to charge for a product, service, idea, or whatnot is whatever the seller wants to charge.  Then the market takes over and decides whether it will bear that price.  Right and wrong in a moral sense doesn't even enter into in my opinion.  If someone wants to charge $300 for a PDF and people will pay it, hu-ah for them.  If they want to give away all their work for free, hu-ah for them.<br/><br/>If I'm asked what price "should" someone charge for anything, my answer is whatever price maximizes your proffits.  I admit that my answer is a pragmatist's answer but in these situations I tend to sit firmly in that camp.<br/><br/>I still like you, Andrew!

How about experience? Any sort of knowledge?<br/><br/>By Andrew's assertion, if I come round to his house or business and do not deliver a product, then my time should be free? My primary business is Information Technology support and some local companies pay me to come round and talk to their in-house IT or just fix the problem. Very seldom do we sell a physical product, we just sell my time. I give about 20 hours a week to my company and they pay me a salary for being able to sell those hours to clients.<br/><br/>The same goes for my writing. I don't sell many PDFs (only ever produced two PDF games: Creed and Testament and they were more like donationware) but I've sold a few hundred books (23rd Letter, Zombi, SpaceNinjaCyberCrisis) and I've always treated it like a hobby. Because that's exactly what it is to me. I'm not worried about making money because I don't value my time the way my business values my time. I write to relax.<br/><br/>From another point of view - surely the proliferation of free games devalues the work of the professional game writer?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61834/#Comment_61834" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T09:37:30+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  9:37AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt - Andrew (the other one, not me) has said that he thinks you should charge for time.

Without the ideas the book is worthless (or nealry so. You could use it as a journal or door stop). Of course the flip side  is that the ideas need to be in a presentable form (in this case the book) before anyone will want them or pay for them. So product and idea are married. But the product acannot exsist without the idea, while the idea can happily exsuist (but not be shared) without the product (be the product a book, PDF, oral presentation or something else).<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Oh.

But for those games to become breaking the Ice or Primitive they required not one initial idea but hundreds of individual ideas, slowly building on each other until a finished game is born.

I just wanted to make it clear that I wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t ignoring or dismissing your posts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Max</b>: Your confusion is totally understandable, here. Lots of smart folks I respect are confused about what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m saying. In large part, this is on me, because of three things. First, I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t start off with a fully reasoned ideology or argument to defend, just an idea to talk about. And while I think that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s okay, my wording apparently led folks to think I was throwing down the debating gauntlet or something. Second, since I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not looking to convert unbelievers and reject any opposing viewpoints, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve absorbed the posts of people here, and realized not everything I started talking about was really all that important or related to what I wanted to discuss. So I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been able to refine what it is that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s at the core of things. Third, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve picked up the impression that many people aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t actually disagreeing with my ideas, but are disagreeing with what they perceive to be my ideas. Or the semantics of my comments. Or something tangential to my ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no, this isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t about justifying theft. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not part of what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m discussing. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s also not about the specific pricing of RPGs. While I thought that might be part of it, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve come to realize it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Robert</b>: The issue of the quality of the book being important to what a consumer will pay is kinda-sorta-tangentially related to what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Brian</b>:  Well, this isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t (from my point of view, at least) a debate or argument. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m just talking about this thing, and interested in understanding other people\xe2\u20ac\u2122s viewpoints and making my own clear. And in the course of this conversation, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve learned stuff and realized some things I was talking about are just side issues around the core of the thing I wanted to talk about. So going from, say, just my initial post or the first few comments skips a lot of the important changes to the discussion. So I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll lay out the relevant ones again, in case they were part of the thread that you skipped.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not talking about electronic documents. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122d be cool in a different thread, but it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a minor side issue to what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m actually talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The same thing goes for hard numbers on pricing. Some of the excellent comments here have helped me to realize that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not actually the dollar amount, but the manner in which any dollar amount is settled upon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, with that clear, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll address what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m reading as the core of your post \xe2\u20ac\u201c <i>\xe2\u20ac\x9d It's not the idea - it's the transmission of the idea from the creator to you that you're really paying for.\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i> I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I agree with that. Because I see that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the product you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re paying for, not the transmission of the idea. Now, we might be saying the same thing in different ways, so I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll try and clear that up. If I buy a game book, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m buying the product that lets me access and more easily apply the idea, certainly. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not buying the transmission of that idea, just the tool that lets me use it. Now if I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not playing the game at the moment, and I loan it to a friend, she can get all the ideas in it, without paying for the game. Because it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the product that has the monetary value \xe2\u20ac\u201c not the ideas, and I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve bought the product. Or are you saying that it\xe2\u20ac\u2122d be right for the game designer to demand payment from my friend?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Joe</b>: I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not quite sure what it is you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re asking me, here. Can you maybe throw some concrete examples my way?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Max (second post)</b>: If it doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t matter to you, that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s cool. It does matter to me, and I can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t give you any better reason for it than the fact that it just does. I mean, I hope I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve conveyed that this is just a concept I wanted to discuss, not some call to act in a specific fashion. Whether it has any practical application is for each person to decide for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt no point have I said it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s cool to take other people\xe2\u20ac\u2122s work without payment. I understand and agree that work has value, which is included in the cost of the product.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Chris</b>: Okay, cool. I think I get what you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re saying now, even though I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have the same belief about money changing things. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d explain my position further, but I think it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pretty well covered so far, and I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to just keep repeating myself. If I haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t been clear enough on my thoughts, though, just let me know and I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll try and get it across in a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Clinton</b>: Awesome, man. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got a lot of respect for your way of rolling with your game sales. And respect for you, and your rockin\xe2\u20ac\u2122 games. Respect all around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Andrew</b>: Hey, I still like you too, even if you are a capitalist pig-dog. But I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking ideology here, not practicality. And yeah, of course you can charge whatever the market will pay. This is about what it is you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re charging for, and what the consumer is actually buying for their money, however much it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Andy</b>: Change that from \xe2\u20ac\u0153giant wrestle-down\xe2\u20ac\x9d to \xe2\u20ac\u0153steel-cage Jungle Speed deathmatch using a custom-made, solid metal totem,\xe2\u20ac\x9d and you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re on! Oh, but leave the oil at home, please.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Matt Johnston</b>: I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not sure where you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re getting all that, Matt. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got no problem charging for services.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this \xe2\u20ac\u201c <i>\xe2\u20ac\u0153From another point of view - surely the proliferation of free games devalues the work of the professional game writer?\xe2\u20ac\x9d</i> \xe2\u20ac\u201c is an absolutely awesome topic, but I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t see how it addresses what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking about in this thread. I am totally begging you to take that topic and start a thread about it, because I would love to have that discussion, just not in this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Ryan</b>: Thanks again for the legal info. Let me bounce another one off you. That example of lending a book that I wrote about above, is that somehow illegal under the law?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Jake</b>: No, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not talking solely about the initial thought that inspired it all. The problem here is that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m seeing a separation between the process of creation and the ideas that come as a result of that process. While they both have value in the sense of being worthwhile, I feel that the process and work have monetary value when applied to a product, but that the ideas themselves do not. Basically, all the bits that exist solely in the mind do not have monetary value, but all the bits that took place or exist in the physical world do. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not it exactly, though, so I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m going to think on this some more. Obviously, I need to find a good way to express what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m trying to say here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61896/#Comment_61896" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T02:07:43+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  2:07AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2007 2:40AM by Mcdaldno.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (re-written for clarity)<br><br>Andrew, I'm having difficulty articulating this idea, because it's in the uber-uber-uber vague state right now.<br><br>Essentially, if I spend time and energy and love on an idea, I want to know it has some worth. Now, if I'm keeping that idea to myself - like I would most daydreams or silly dreams of the future - then the only person who needs to show it worth is me, and I'm doing that already, by dedicating time to it.<br><br>But, if I want to share this idea and all the work that went into honing and expressing it, I want the world to give it worth too. (*removes a silly metaphor*) If I'm going to share with you my precious baby that I've soaked so much into, I want you to give it the proper respect.<br><br>It's a human desire to have our ideas be acknowledged and appreciated, right? I think so.<br><br>So, plug that whole dynamic into a capitalist society, and you have people who develop ideas, then package and sell them. Regardless of whether you say you're paying for the idea or the product, by paying $18 for an indie RPG you are giving monetary worth to both.<br><br>If you were just paying the costs associated with creating an RPG (art comissioning, editing and layout fees, printing costs, shipping costs, Gencon booth buy-in cost or whatever...) and not paying additional money to the creator/designer/idea-man, then you'd be paying for just the product. Right? (Take what I'm saying with a generous reading and a grain of salt. I'm stumbling here.)<br><br>Now, if you were to do that - buy a book at cost, you wouldn't really be giving any worth to the idea. As I stated topside of this post, I believe ideas have a lot of work and their designers NEED some kind of recognition and appreciation. It's like oxygen for creators.<br><br>So... um... *tries to articulate here*<br><br>One way of recognizing the worth of an idea is through discussion. Another is through incorporating that idea into your ideas. Another is producing playtest reports describing waht you like about a certain idea or game.<br><br>But maybe that's not enough for some people.<br><br>If someone said, "Joe, here's an idea: Instead of factoring your time and energy into your game, sell it at cost. Instead of your idea gaining worth through a side income, I'll show my appreciation for the idea for teaching you how to meditate and find your spiritual center", I'd agree to that deal. It's... kinda far fetched and a silly proposition, but I'd agree to it. It's a way of giving my ideas a worth, that doesn't tie into cash in my pocket. I'm cool with that deal - I need a spiritual center at least as much as I need money.<br><br>Does this make any more sense now, Andrew?<br>If not, forget about it and I'll try to explain it again in a few months.<br><br><br>PS. Yes, that is an open call. If anyone wants to show me how to find my spiritual center and learn to still my mind, I'll consider it appreciation enough for any idea/work/effort/creation that I put out into the world - be it an RPG or something else.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61918/#Comment_61918" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T06:55:11+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  6:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding what you're trying to say.
