But for some reason I came to think of them again.</p>\n<p>Typically (though not necessarily my preference), conflict-level resolution has more detail, more inputs, more post-Fortune elements. You add extra dice through FoRKs or what have you.</p>\n<p>You zoom out to resolve the entire conflict in one roll, then you kinda break that roll up again to make it more detailed and more fine-grained even though it\u2019s zoomed out.</p>\n<p>I just posted the following as a comment on Rob Donoghue\u2019s blog:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, what I\u2019ve found with this in Blades (which I\u2019ve never played, but I\u2019m trying to catch up on one of the web series (RollPlay Blades, I\u2019m halfway through Week 16 now)) is that it is sorta like hitpoints. Hitpoints for a situation rather than for a person.</p>\nSince Blades\u2019 mechanic is as detailed as a conflict-level resolution mechanic (with multiple inputs [SIS position, SIS effect, special abilities, pushed help, pushed self, Devil\u2019s Bargain], and several Fortune in the Middle factors such as Resist rolls), every roll, hmm, takes a good while. Every roll in Blades is like a whole fight in our D&amp;D 5e game.<br/>But, it\u2019s not used as a conflict-level resolution mechanic. Because of the many clocks, in practice it becomes a task level mechanic. You Skirmish and Resist on the individual Harm level, not on the Scene level. And what happens is that fights sometimes takes one and a half hours or more.<br/>By contrast, in our 5e game this last Thursday (we do a mashup of 5e and Dramasystem, everyone has a 5e character sheet and a Dramasystem character sheet, and 90% of our play is in the Drama layer, but when action happens, the D&amp;D dice come out), one character was sneaking on an NPC and tried to subdue her. She startled her with her short sword (represented as HP loss w/ sneak bonus), they both jumped out of the window where the character kept threatening her with the sword (more HP loss, w/o sneak this time) and then hid. The NPC (also a rogue) used her main action + cunning action to double dash 90 feet, so the player character shot her dead with a shortbow w/ sneak bonus. The whole thing was over in mere minutes\u2026 and that was a level 5 rogue (the PC) vs a level 8 rogue (the NPC).<br/>The HP (which represent\u2026 threat, upper hand, position, footing, momentum, wounds, scratches, fatigue, hope, fate, destiny\u2026 not all of these at once but a sum of these factors) is what\u2019s pacing the scene while we can have plenty of fine-grained SIS interaction since the system is task-level based. In one fight we had sneaking, climbing, trying to subdue/capture w/ sword, jumping out the window, booking it, taking a lethal shot. All paced out by HP. (But every roll fast and simple. You sneak? You just roll. You Go Aggro with your sword? You just roll. You hide again? You just roll. You shoot? You just roll.)<br/></blockquote>\n<p>Now back to the S-G audience. (I didn\u2019t originally think of S-G when I wrote the comment\u2026 but I wanted to bring it here, too.)</p>\n<p>My point is, I guess, that when you add all the detail of a typical conflict-level designed roll to a task-level roll\u2026 everything takes a lot of time. Fate Core has a similar thing going on to a lesser extent\u2026 and, Marvel Heroic Roleplaying, too?</p>\n<p>Compared to a game like The Shadow of Yesterday or Dogs in the Vineyard which also has pretty fiddly rolls\u2026 but there, the protocol resolves the whole thing.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464172/#Comment_464172" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-19T14:01:09+00:00" title="June 19, 2017  2:01PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bear in mind that that is only one way to play Blades, and the game explicitly tells you to dial up or down the granularity to suit your tastes.

After all the work it takes to get to rolling the dice and interpreting the results, sometimes it feels like it should really wrap something up, but then all it does is mark a few ticks on a clock, right?<br/><br/>Here's the thing, I think: a clock tick is never just a clock tick. It's always a change in the fiction, something always happens. The clocks are just for keeping track of larger things that are going on at the same time. So for instance, if you have a clock for the guards in the mansion you're sneaking through, then you roll the dice and you explore the place -- that's what happens after each roll -- but when do the guards raise the alarm? That's what the clock is tracking.<br/><br/>If you're in a fight where things could change a lot before either side goes down, then clocks might help you know when it's over. But if it's really just a momentary thing, then they'll get in the way. For example, if you're sneaking up behind someone to assassinate them, a clock would only get in the way of that. But would they shout out while you attack them, to alert those guards? Would they yell loudly enough? Would it only come out a moan or gasp? There's a lot of nuance here, and the 4-5 result on a controlled, risky, or desperate roll gives you the space to interpret it and see how many ticks on the "alarm" clock you should mark. If it's the first significant noise in the house, maybe the guards would only perk up their ears and say "eh? did you hear something?" But if there have been other noises (i.e. clock ticks), that means now they might be to the point where they say, "that was definitely something, we gotta go check it out!"<br/><br/>In a simple pass/fail system, it would be up to the GM to just decide what the various factors are, whether you should roll again and so on, without having much in the system to support them in those decisions. That's okay, and some people like that better, but anyway, those are some of the tradeoffs I see. <br/><br/>Hope that's of some help in thinking about it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464225/#Comment_464225" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-21T07:33:50+00:00" title="June 21, 2017  7:33AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2017 7:41AM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" rel="nofollow">Kayfall</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Hope that\u2019s of some help in thinking about it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/></p></div></blockquote>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" rel="nofollow">Kayfall</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>Hi, I\u2019m not a Blades expert, but somehow I still feel like I get what you\u2019re talking about.

Most RPGs are some sort of conversation, but Blades puts creative collaboration, negotiation, and agreement between players at the forefront.<br/><br/>The rolls themselves do not take much time (obviously); it's the discussion around the rolls, and that discussion time will vary widely from group to group. The system bridges the mechanical/fictional divide in a way that leaves a vast, fruitful void, and that void is filled with discussion that works out the details. Most things are open to interpretation, which can be really exciting for the right group, because the payoff for more creative buy-in is greater player investment and engagement.<br/><br/>The conversation can be as brief or drawn out as a given group makes it; at one end of the spectrum the GM could move things from roll to roll just as swiftly as in any PbtA game, and at the other end the conversation could extend a fight between a handful of people in a room over several hours. I would argue that the Rollplay crew is enjoying that conversation and John is cued into that, which is one reason it takes longer. It's just as easy in Blades to say, "Okay, you're going into this nasty close-quarters fight with the bodyguards. Roll Skirmish, +1d for teamwork, and we'll see how things are sitting when the dust clears." You could choose to make that fight one roll if it felt like the right thing for the rhythm of your game.<br/><br/>It's this very open bridging of the mechanical/fictional divide, with very crunchy bits in service of a fluid, player-driven narrative, that some of us find so appealing about Blades. The tradeoff is that each group has to find it's own way of having the conversation, and developing and maintaining a consistency to that conversation is one of the GM's biggest tasks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464239/#Comment_464239" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-22T15:08:49+00:00" title="June 22, 2017  3:08PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So in Dice &amp; Cloud terms, what I'm hearing when I watch the show is a lot of 'Dice' talk. Trying to read you charitably, Jason, I get the vibe that it's supposed to be a lot of 'Arrows' talk (i.e. talk about <i>how</i> the 'Cloud' map to the 'Dice' and vice versa).<br/>The fruitful void \u2014 the Blades system have all these hungry hooks that need filling from consulting the 'Cloud' (the shared imagined space).<br/><br/>But\u2026 what I'm hearing on the show is a lot of talk pretty much centered in 'Dice'. "Do you want to Push? No, I've already taken so much Stress. But I'll spend my Foresight. OK we'll say that you anticipated this somehow. Haha, yeah, right\u2026 down to every last blow"<br/><br/>But even if they <i>were</i> spending a lot of time on 'Arrows' talk\u2026 I understand that that's a sign of a flexible system but to me it'd possibly be even boringer than spending it on 'Dice' talk. At least, with 'Dice' talk, at least you're talking about an interesting game of resources and transactions. About managing your Stress, figuring probabilities, placing bets, profiting and losing. That sort of talk is something all of the RollPlay Blades crew seem to enjoy. But with 'Arrows' talk, it'd be all "Oh, this abstract thing represents this", and "This concrete thing represents that" etc. Usually 'Arrows' talk is something I want to get oven with pretty quickly.<br/><br/><br/>In general\u2026 my own preference is do do primarily "Cloud" talk. The world of "Dice" is something I want to <i>consult</i>, in a straightforward, obvious way. Like a magic eightball. Our most used 'Dice' thing in D&amp;D is definitely encounter checks. "Do monsters show up right now? y/n"<br/><br/>Again, I'm a strong believer in Fortune at the End. That means that the random component, the 'Fortune', isn't followed by a lot of clarification and discussion like increased effect, consequences etc. It's just "Can she see you behind that corner? y/n".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464240/#Comment_464240" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-22T15:10:56+00:00" title="June 22, 2017  3:10PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess the Magic Eightball itself, with it's eight answers, isn't what I'm looking for \u2014 I wanted two answers, y/n.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/admanb" title="admanb"><img alt="admanb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/admanb">admanb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464245/#Comment_464245" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-22T22:18:41+00:00" title="June 22, 2017 10:18PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's worth mentioning that Bloodletters -- the show John Harper has been running since the early days of Blades -- uses <i>way fewer</i> clocks for major conflicts. It seems quite possible that the use of clocks in RollPlay Blades was a conscious choice targeted towards the players and audience of that show, who have more experience with D&amp;D and such then PbtA-style games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464258/#Comment_464258" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-24T01:24:06+00:00" title="June 24, 2017  1:24AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting discussion.<br/><br/>I haven't played Blades yet, but I got the impression from reading the rules that there would a lot of what you (Sandra) call "Dice talk", and it turns me off a little, too.<br/><br/>I don't mind all the Fortune-in-the-Middle stuff, but I only want it when it's directly connected to fictional happenings.<br/><br/>(Although I think that there are subtler, long-term effects from many of these mechanics which are less obvious: for instance, giving players more means of adjusting the outcomes of die rolls means more player agency over the course of a game, which does change the general direction of play over time. Mechanics like the Devil's Bargain mean more complex, messy situations where the heroes make compromises, which also colours the fiction and the characters in a very specific way.
