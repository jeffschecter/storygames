No can do he said, any non vital use of computer power lead to excess head generation and excess heat generation had been the death of countless sloppy cargo haulers in the last decades. Plus, he hated the smell of sweaty crew. First mate K\xf6hler was not happy. How could they pretend they were on some planet when their dice would float around flaunting the fact they were stuck in zero-g for endless months to come? Add to that the fact that the best way to roll them they had come up with yet was shaking them in a cup of pudding till they stuck before reading, not only was it messy but seeing what side was up was ambigious more often than not. Just rolling them in a cupped hand and then holding them against a wall worked well till they discovered Grimes had a tendency to get just the numbers he needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_353484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353484/#Comment_353484" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-08T16:25:40+00:00" title="January  8, 2012  4:25PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>- I've heard of a game with magnetic dice,</i> said the first mate; <i>Great for rpg in zero-g.
