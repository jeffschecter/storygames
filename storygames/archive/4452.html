Maybe think of 2-3 quite different characters from that setting area.<br/><br/>Secrets are trickier, they can be more abundant, but they are mostly a variation of the "Bonus die" central Secrets.<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100699/#Comment_100699" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T07:58:41+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  7:58AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like, if I were making Dragonlance gnomes in TSOY, I'd make a few funky secrets. Then when it comes to keys, I'd probably only have 1-2 secrets.<br/><br/>One would show off the fact that they love complicated invention (with a buyoff of "create an invention that works as intended").<br/>The other might emphasize, I dunno, a gnome hivemind or something.<br/><br/>I find the setting of Dragonlance otherwise generic, so let's move over to Dark Sun. If I were converting it to TSOY, I'd probably have 1-2 unique keys for each city-state, which perhaps show off the Stereotypes that other people from the setting have about people from that city-state.<br/><br/>The greek-roman analogue place (damn, forget the name now) I'd have like a Key of Nobility, Key of Slavery, perhaps a Key of Patrician, and emphasize a general world-setting Key of Treachery.<br/><br/>Nibenay (the India/Cambodia-analogue) I'd have a Key of Our Culture is the Best, Key of Alien Mysteriousness.<br/><br/>Raaj (the Jerusalem-analogue) I'd have a key like "The Key of Poverty", "Key of the Downtrodden", or "Key of the Righteous Templar".<br/><br/>Hope that helps. Focus on:<br/>Races<br/>and<br/>Distinct Cultures/Nations in the setting, not the "setting as a whole".  If your setting is nothing more than a single nation/culture, then maybe up to 2 unique keys max.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100705/#Comment_100705" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T08:13:11+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  8:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy is right that the best way to start is to flesh out the races and cultures in terms of keys, by focusing on the stereotypes. Once you have those, they, along with the stock ones from TSOY, may well cover everything. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the one other thing to consider is if there are any "setting themes" that you want to see. Like, let's say we're playing in the Midnight setting. All of the cultures are subjugated, none are in open rebellion (I think... let's assume that's the case). But rebelling is a big part of play. So you may want to put out a Key of Rebellion, just so that players have to consider it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that it's quite easy to make up new keys, and players should be encouraged to come up with new ones. The only real reason for having something like a setting-specific key like this, is to make the option somehow thematically charged. That is, if you put Key of Rebellion out there in front of the characters, then not taking the key begs the question of the characters of whether or not they are in compliance or even collusion with the Dark Lord. Or are they in Rebellion, but just not getting XP for it? Basically it forces that question into the open so that it becomes central to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a setting in mind? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100711/#Comment_100711" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T08:21:42+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  8:21AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>... until I was basically making Keys for very generic character motivations, at which point it seemed I could have just allowed players to define their own keys ad hoc.<br/></blockquote>\nA couple of these can still be useful to give the players a springboard.

For that reason, it's sometimes useful to create like-minded keys, to provide options in a long-running game. <br/><br/>For example, Key of Love, Key of Fraternity, and Key of the Guardian are all very similiar in concept- a 1/2/5 Key that is based on your character having someone he cares about and who influences his actions.  The character can have these separate keys at the same time or in sequence, giving them three possible relationships instead of just one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RPL" title="RPL"><img alt="RPL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RPL">RPL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100737/#Comment_100737" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T09:07:18+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  9:07AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2007 9:09AM by RPL.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Mike an Andy,<br/><br/>You have to define from the start where are you going to focus the themes of the game, the way I see it in TSoY you have a lot of inter/intra-racial and culture clashes. So the keys (and the rest of the crunch) are racial and culture based.<br/><br/>However when a friend of mine showed me some Iron Kingdoms literature and asked me if I would help him make a TSoY game out of it, the first thing we had (and still have) to define was were would we want to focus the setting-clashes, the way I see it Religion (instead of Culture) and Race would be the way to go, because I think there is a lot of that one can explore in that setting <b>Edit:</b> so our keys should focus on things and beliefs from each particular religion and race.<br/><br/>So if you could make a very short list of the thematic conflicts you would want you game to have, and them start to build some opposing forces it becames easier to outline the Keys.<br/><br/>Hope it helped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100843/#Comment_100843" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T12:56:01+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 12:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2007 12:56PM by DevP.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>There's so much glorious buy-in from people who make their own keys.</blockquote>\nSo is this a common thing?
