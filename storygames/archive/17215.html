I had never used this playset before. There are so many playsets that usually when I play one my reaction is \u201cThat was great \u2013 I hope to do it again someday after I\u2019ve gotten through the many, many others on my to-play list.\u201d With Transatlantic, though, my reaction was \u201cThat was SUPER great \u2013 I\u2019d gladly do that one again anytime!\u201d <br/><br/>The background of Transatlantic is that you are on the maiden voyage of the Leviathan, a luxury cruise ship, in 1932. As part of the established write-up, the captain is secretly trying to win an award for crossing the Atlantic in record time. It\u2019s not clear to me that this detail will factor into all (or even most) Transatlantic games, but given our particular Setup, it did \u2013 big time!<br/><br/>Here are our characters and Setup elements:<br/><br/><i><b>Ashley Tarrington (me)</b></i>, an American male in his early 20\u2019s.

Rider Simons (of the Yard) and his young, American bride, Mabel, are on board the maiden voyage of the luxury liner, Leviathan, for their honeymoon. Rider is grouching and grumbling the entire time, and a bit seasick. <br/><br/>This is a relief to Mabel, since it will give her a chance to sneak away and see her old (male) friend, Ashley Tarrington, whom she has secretly been in love with since they were teenagers. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley has also been in love with her all of this time. They were good (platonic) friends in high school who had planned to go away to college together, before Ashley changed his plans, hurriedly leaving for New York to try to get his big break on Broadway. His attempts were unsuccessful, and he ended up working as a magician\u2019s assistant on this cruise ship, a humiliating job that usually involves him making childish jokes as \u201cthe Amazing Randy\u201d performs his feats. <br/><br/>Neither Ashley nor Mabel has ever spoken of their love for the other aloud, but they\u2019ve recently begun writing to each other again, and old feelings and hopes have rekindled in both of them. In fact, Mabel has maneuvered matters so that her honeymoon with Rider is aboard the very ship on which Ashley is working. But Mabel is not particularly bright about her manipulations \u2013 her husband, Rider, thinks that \u201cAshley\u201d is a female friend, and Ashley doesn\u2019t even realize she\u2019s married, thinking she\u2019s accompanying female friends on the voyage. How long can such a ruse last?<br/><br/>Mabel and Rider attend the Amazing Randy\u2019s performance that night without Rider figuring out that \u201cAshley\u201d is male \u2013 given the fact that Ashley goes by the name of \u201cAsh\u201d while onstage. However, there\u2019s plenty more to keep Rider\u2019s attention. First, he recognizes the Amazing Randy; he\u2019s not sure from where, but he believes it may be from the stack of wanted-criminal photos back in England. Matters get even worse when Ashley selects a member of the audience to take part in one of Randy\u2019s tricks; Randy actually steals the young woman\u2019s pocketbook right in front of the crowd; he\u2019s quite sneaky about it, but the keen eye of Det. Rider Simons (of the Yard) notices it! <br/><br/>But a pocketbook isn\u2019t the only thing the young woman was carrying. Because of the way she was sitting, when Ashley selected her from the audience, he didn\u2019t realize she was holding an infant. When she reluctantly comes up on stage with the baby, Randy (more interested in stealing her pocketbook) agrees to continue the magic trick with the woman and her child. Once the pocket book has been stolen, Randy puts them both in a large black box, mother holding infant. He closes and then opens the box \u2013 they are gone! The audience applauds. He closes and then opens the box again \u2013 the mother is back\u2026 but her child is gone! The audience gasps! This is not part of the trick!<br/><br/>The shipboard staff manages to cover up the missing child, in large part because the captain is clearly more interested in winning his coveted speed award. But the crew secretly enlists the aid of Det. Rider Simons (of the Yard) in the search for the baby. Rider is particularly suspicious, given his recollection of Randy\u2019s face along with what he saw Randy do with the mother\u2019s pocketbook. Rider is even more intrigued when he sees that one of the lifeboats on deck is missing. Could this be connected to the missing infant? <i>(Spoiler alert: It\u2019s not. We never really explained why the lifeboat was missing, but it does make a return appearance in Act 2!)</i><br/><br/>While Rider is investigating the mystery, Mabel is consoling Ashley, who (like Randy) is distraught about the child\u2019s disappearance. The two stare longingly at each other and finally admit that they have always loved each other. Shockingly, this admission is overheard by an irate Rider, who has returned to question \u201cAsh.\u201d Rider then realizes that \u201cAshley\u201d the woman is actually \u201cAsh\u201d the man! He berates Ashley for loving another man\u2019s wife and then punches Ashley right in the face! Rider storms off, and Mabel chases after him. Ashley realizes that the only woman he has ever loved is now married to another man, a better man. He knows he has lost her for good.<br/><br/>Near the end of Act 1, we are let in on a magician\u2019s \u201ctrick of the trade.\u201d The Amazing Randy has employed a man named Mr. Patel to assist with his tricks. There is a trap door underneath the black box on the magician\u2019s stage. For this particular trick, Mr. Patel is supposed to help the chosen audience member down through the trap door when Randy closes the black box for the first time and then return them back above when Randy closes the black box for the second time. Clearly that did not happen with the infant! Randy confronts Patel about the missing infant, but the hired man claims innocence; he returned mother and child to their proper place, he swears! <br/><br/>Act 1 ends with the voyage growing rockier and rockier as the Captain attempts his ill-advised attempt to beat the racing record.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390485/#Comment_390485" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T20:34:25+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  8:34PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 8:42PM by jda1974.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Tilt</b></span><br/>* Mayhem - A frantic chase<br/>* Paranoia - A sudden reversal (status, fortune, sympathy)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Act 2</b></span><br/>Ashley is on deck of the now-severely-rocking ship. Everyone else is in their cabins for safety. Ashley thinks back to the last time he saw Mabel. They\u2019d just graduated high school together, and she believed they\u2019d soon be attending university together. But he broke the news to her that he was leaving the next morning to pursue his dreams of becoming a Broadway star. He had a talent, a passion, a need to be in theatre. And he couldn\u2019t let university or his parents\u2019 expectations or his\u2026 \u201cfriendship\u201d\u2026 with Mabel deter him. He left her, weeping, to go become a star. And now look at him. No money. A humiliating job. And the love of his life married to another man. At that moment, he decides to end it all, climbing up on the ship\u2019s railing to jump off \u2013 when, suddenly, they hit a huge wave! The ship jerks to a severe angle, and he falls back, hitting the nearest wall. He suddenly forgets about his own selfish suicidal desires. What the devil is wrong with the ship? He has to get to Mabel and make sure she\u2019s safe!<br/><br/>The ship is now at nearly a 45 degree angle. Amidst the chaos, Rider continues his search. He finds the elusive (but still Amazing) Randy and bluffs, saying he remembers Randy\u2019s criminal photo from the Yard. He questions Randy about the child, the pocketbook theft and the missing lifeboat. Randy claims to know nothing (in fact, he only knows about one of those three subjects \u2013 the missing pocketbook). But Rider puts him in the ship\u2019s holding cell anyway, and goes on to continue the search for the child.<br/><br/>No one is manning the holding cell given the looming disaster. Mr. Patel, Randy\u2019s unseen stagehand, pays him a visit and finally comes clean; Mr. Patel has, in fact, stolen the infant. Now that Randy\u2019s been implicated in the disappearance, Mr. Patel demands that Randy pay him a significant portion of the money Randy has stolen from various passengers over the years; in return, Patel will see to the infant\u2019s safe return and Randy will no longer be a suspect. <br/><br/>Ashley hurriedly arrives at Mabel\u2019s suite. She is alone, but not for long. Rider soon arrives, and the two men get into a fight. This time, Ashley is the one to punch Rider out. Ashley and Mabel rush off; they are on the higher side of the ship, which is not where they want to be since only lifeboats on the lower side will be able to launch off of the ship. Given all the throngs of panicked passengers, Ashley, who knows the ship relatively well, convinces Mabel that they make their way through the bowels of the ship as a shortcut to the other side; even if there\u2019s some minor flooding, they can come out on the lower side without having to fight through the crowds.<br/><br/>What Ashley and Mabel do not realize is that Rider has been following them. <i><b>A frantic chase </b></i>ensues in the bowels of the Leviathan. Rider ultimately pulls out a gun and forces his wife and her love into a walk-in galley freezer, where he locks them in. In the freezer, Ashley and Mabel find the body of the missing infant, frozen to death. <i>(you were warned) </i><br/><br/>Randy has let himself out of the cell (he is a magician, after all), and he and Mr. Patel of them go to get the kidnapped child, which Randy believes is still alive. Mr. Patel leads Randy through the ankle-deep water of the Leviathan\u2019s bowels to the walk-in freezer. Randy is confused, even more so when Mr. Patel starts to push him inside, laughing that once Randy is dead, Mr. Patel can easily find Randy\u2019s stash of stolen money and valuables. But Mr. Patel doesn\u2019t realize that Ashley and Mabel are inside. They push their way out and overpower Patel, locking him inside. <br/><br/>\u201cWhat about the baby!?!\u201d Mabel cries.<br/><br/>\u201cScrew it!\u201d says Ashley. \u201cIt\u2019s dead!\u201d<br/><br/>This attitude leaves Mabel stunned. She is even more stunned when they get to the deck and she sees Rider, caringly loading child after child after child into lifeboats, regardless of her own safety. This, coupled with Ashley\u2019s coldness regarding the dead child, causes her to have <i><b>a sudden reversal </b></i>in her feelings for the men.<br/><br/>At this point, the ship is clearly reaching the sinking point. There are only two seats left on the remaining lifeboat. Ashley begs Randy to let Ashley and Mabel take those two seats. Before Randy can even protest, Mabel loudly announces that she will not go; she is to remain with Rider no matter what. She loves Rider and never should have chosen Ashley over her husband! She rushes to Rider\u2019s side and helps him secure and cast off the last of the full lifeboats. <br/><br/>Ashley dejectedly gets into the lifeboat with Randy, and it casts off. Mabel and Rider watch the lifeboats sail away, waiting for the inevitable in each other\u2019s\u2019 arms. <br/><br/>But then\u2026 they see it! The lifeboat that Rider had noticed was \u201cmissing\u201d earlier in the voyage is lazily floating up towards the ship; it must have somehow gotten loose, and fate has sent it to rescue them! Parts of the deck are now fully submerged, so they are able to easily navigate to the lifeboat and their chance for safety!<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Aftermath</b></span><br/>But, alas, safety is not meant to be for Rider. After using his gun to force Ashley and Mabel into the cell, he must not have secured it properly; as he\u2019s getting into the lifeboat, it goes off, and he shoots himself in the stomach. He dies in the lifeboat, in Mabel\u2019s arms.<br/><br/>Ashley and Randy\u2019s lifeboat does get to safety\u2026 safety for Ashley, anyway. Randy is not as lucky. It seems Rider has radioed ahead about Randy\u2019s elicit activities. The authorities are waiting for him, and he is hauled off to spend the rest of his life in jail.<br/><br/>Mabel is distraught after Rider\u2019s death. The years are not kind to her, and those who survived the ship\u2019s sinking heard her confess to trying to leave her respected policeman husband for a mere ship\u2019s entertainer. She is left sad and alone, shunned by society.<br/><br/>Ashley is a broken man. He never finds love again and never finds success in the theatre; it pains him to know that his high point was performing as the Amazing Randy\u2019s assistant. Many year later, destitute but still seeking culture, he begs to volunteer as an usher at a popular new Broadway play, a play he could have starred in had fate been kinder. Amidst the scoffs and insults from high-society ladies and gentlemen, he settles in to watch the performance (standing, naturally, since the volunteers are not allowed to sit). The lights go down, the scene opens and the star comes out. He is shocked to see it is Mr. Patel.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
