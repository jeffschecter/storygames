Like, designing an encounter and let it eternize because players aren't hitting the right answers or are in a bad dice day?  I know most of the time we all perceive this at the table and start pulling our own emergency protocols, like GMs fiat to make it go foward, helpful npcs and clues that pop out of thin air or get gracefully inserted and save the day. Or like players who go a bit out of character to push the story fowards or just plain attempt to breake the world to find their own fun.<br/><br/>Ok, basically I don't mean to rant at poor solutions from any side, nor praise the good solutions and intentions nor enumerate all possible in-game, houseruling and out-of-play solutions at all. I'm aiming right now just for one of those solutions and I would like to know if you have ever used it, to what degree of success and if you ever made an habit of using it.<br/><br/>And that's breaking the fight. Ending the boring combat or dungeon crawling scene with a totally diferent situation, viewpoint, atmosphere. Either as a GM or as a player. Here's my experience with it.<br/><br/>Our campaign had a good start with an scene <i>a la</i> "Hangover", where the PCs awoke in a tabern not knowing what happened... in the past 5 years. They find out their check was payed by an stranger who was drinking with them last night and go to check up their trunk at the stable. They find several strange things, like a wanted poster with their faces on it... as it seems they are now accused of kidnapping a princess. Oh, and on the bottom of the trunk they find the head of said princess. Anyway, they start to run from kingdom to kingdom only to find they have done more bad than good on those five years everywhere and then... well, the campaign started to go somewhat flat. It was kinda my fault as a GM but I still hadn't got a clue about how to solve it.<br/><br/>For the next session I had a random dungeon generated and a couple of events that I was hoping would work, but the dungeon was taking ages to cross... so in the middle of it and without finishing the pursue of an NPC who seemingly had some clues about what were they into in those five years, players make an stop and came up with the most radical solution ever. They started their own cult, took over the entire town, made the dungeon their main base of operations and forged an organization to make an stand against all the kingdoms and powers in the shadows that had used them. Instead of running they prepared a "welcome party" and I found it so amusing I totally rolled with it. We had loads of fun.<br/><br/>Later in that campaign we went into "Microscope" mode to roleplay what had happened in the ancient past on the setting, which also became a really fun way to explain the players an important piece of the setting, with massive battles almost turned into a single roll conflict resolutions. Again, this made for a great change of pace and later we kept changing back from micro to macro management and back again as situations required.<br/><br/>So, why don't we use this more? Why aren't we engraining more such options into games rules? Why is that "conflict" in RPGs has just become a synonymous of combat and competition? I say, let's breake the friggin fight more often!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409024/#Comment_409024" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-14T13:29:47+00:00" title="March 14, 2013  1:29PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The key words there are "the story." What story? Whose story?<br/><br/>I suspect you mean "the GM's story," which suggests that the players are merely along for the ride. As you suggest, this can be tricky to handle. The players don't do the "right" thing. The dice don't support the direction the GM wanted to go. The fun can come to a grinding halt.<br/><br/>In book advice about this kind of thing, you'll often see topics like:<br/><br/>* How do I keep the players on track?<br/>* How do I keep the players engaged?<br/>* What do I do when the dice ruin the fun?<br/><br/>There are a couple different philosophies about this. One basically says that the job of the GM is to make things fun, and that the rules aren't perfect and were never meant to be complete, so the GM has to ignore them here and there to keep things on track. Another philosophy says that the game rules should strive to be more complete so that the GM isn't responsible for the fun in the first place. <br/><br/>Personally, I fall in the middle somewhere. I think some rule systems are just broken and should be improved. On the other hand, I don't discount that the GM is a valuable part of a good (GM-ful) gaming experience.<br/><br/>I assume, in your example, you were playing D&amp;D or something close. Those games are more or less about fighting things to earn XP, then spending XP to improve so you are better at fighting. In 4E, this was tuned so perfectly that it's fairly difficult to get players to care about anything else. In earlier versions, it was less perfectly tuned for that, so there was more wiggle room, but the reward cycle still strongly rewarded leveling, which encouraged XP-oriented adventures, which discouraged anything that wasn't rewarded with XP. Depending on the GM and campaign, you might get as much XP for being mystery detectives as fighting orcs and looting gold, so there was no incentive to go into the dungeon.<br/><br/>Now, if your players were having a blast traipsing across the continent and finding out their backhistory and all these (alleged?) misdeeds, then suddenly they are thrust into a dungeon for more than a couple hours, it's no surprise they changed the music. Forget dungeon crawling, limited environments, meaningless encounters, torches and ten-foot poles. Back to social encounters: a new cult, a town takeover, and taking on the world! And "we had loads of fun." Of course you did.<br/><br/>How much did D&amp;D or whatever you were using really support that kind of freewheeling, continent-crossing play? Probably not a whole lot. I have fallen into the same pitfall as you, throwing meaningless combat encounters or dungeons at players when I run out of ideas. It's because that's where all the Situation support is in the D&amp;D rules. The basic situation of a D&amp;D game is, "You and your mostly-trusted friends are at the entrance to a dungeon, full of monsters guarding the treasure you seek!" If you want to play that kind of game, it will make you supremely happy. If you do not, you will fumble around and make the fun yourself, and the rules won't help all that much.<br/><br/>Look, at some point you switched to Microscope, which gave you the kind of support you wanted for the game you wanted to play! Enough said. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I love D&amp;D. I play D&amp;D. I've played just about every version of D&amp;D since Moldvay. I still run 13th Age campaigns, and that's basically D&amp;D. I still struggle with getting the game I want out of it, though, because I don't want to focus on dungeon crawls or set-piece combat encounters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409028/#Comment_409028" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-14T14:29:57+00:00" title="March 14, 2013  2:29PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the characters just didn't have any motivation to live.

So what if you found a new rule stating something like "<i>whenever you use more than 40 dice rolls to resolve an scene, introduce a story twist that makes the previous challenge unimportant. Change the pace if you must.</i>"?\n<blockquote><br/>I assume, in your example, you were playing D&amp;D or something close.

It had more of the anime-like philosophy of "whatever looks more epic goes" so xp wasn't awarded for monster killing and looting but for epic roleplaying instead. Hmm... perhaps if you try playing Wuxia using houseruled D&amp;D you'll get closer to the kind of game we're into.\n<blockquote><br/>Now, if your players were having a blast traipsing across the continent and finding out their backhistory and all these (alleged?) misdeeds, then suddenly they are thrust into a dungeon for more than a couple hours, it's no surprise they changed the music.

It isn't totally oriented to just dungeon crawling, but since the original Anima is somewhat based in D&amp;D, it isn't exactly fully oriented to world-wandering. However I do love the totally crazy and fun game mechanics I've found in this forum, so I try and hack them whenever I can. Microscope has been used for setting creation before, so I was confident it would do it.\n<blockquote><br/>Don't get me wrong. I love D&amp;D. I play D&amp;D.

Our group actually went into Anima running away from a 3.5 campaign poorly mastered, which in turn kinda made us hate old school dungeon crawling. It took us a few years to finally come to terms with it and now we're trying Pathfinder. However we still can't play old school right, we're still kicking doors and our GM is rolling with it instead of killing our characters left and right. I know the old school fun isn't there, but it's a part of the training you've got to take to finally get to enjoy it. But hey, what kind of games do you enjoy more then, and why?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409036/#Comment_409036" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-14T16:53:39+00:00" title="March 14, 2013  4:53PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I think the characters just didn't have any motivation to live.

D&amp;D isn't built for that, as it's name implies. Not that the rest can't be houseruled easily. But yes I've found too that things as aspects, motivations and objectives for PCs, either suggested by the GM or the player herself are key to make the campaign work. Otherwise the GM has to work his ass off to stablish links between the PCs themselves and between the PCs and the world, which is the less efficient way to go if you've got at least one old school player at your table.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
