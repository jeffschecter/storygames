They had raided a warehouse and had jacked a few vehicles that were being stored there. Now with a half dozen bikers, a couple of modified trucks and an armored Semi with a .50 cal mounted to the roof.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hocus was driving one of the stolen vehicles and had an el Camino gaining on it. Not normally a problem when you are driving an armored SUV, however in the bed of the el camino is a guy with an RPG and he is about to turn the Hocus into a bunch of toasted scrap metal.<br/>\n<br/>\nLark (the Hocus) decides that she is going to try and distract the driver because she doesn't really have much room to maneuver. She decides that she wants to use Augury (a couple of her flock are in the vehicle with her) to isolate the el camino's driver from the Maelstrom. She rolls a 12 and I ask her why she what she is intending to do once he is isolated. She shrugs and tells me "I'm just gonna let come back." after clarification she says she wants the maelstrom slam back against his psyche after having a single moment without the little whispers that are the constant drone of the maelstrom.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has succeeded in her roll and has given me a good idea of how she wants this to go down. Also, this is the first time anyone has really come up with anything definite about the maelstrom and how it works in this world. So I was thinking of the way that the maelstrom affects the Quarantine when they are first coming from stasis. And I figure there is no real reason that this should not work. So the driver screams as the maelstrom smashes out his sanity, he swerves and the RPG fires into the bed of the el camino.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my big question is whether this is how Augury is supposed to be, or is commonly used? Either way, please give me some examples of how people <b>have</b> used it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334111/#Comment_334111" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T16:25:56+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  4:25PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good to me. Do you have a Quarantine in your game? If so, you could have thought of it as the Maelstrom's return giving the NPC psi-harm, which might have done exactly what you had happen (i.e. BOOM!).  But, yeah, sounds like you did fine just focusing on the fiction (which always works!)<br><br>Augury's done all sorts of things in the games I've played:<br>-- removed someone's mind from a computer matrix<br>-- opened a window into the past<br>-- freed someone's mind from ghosts<br>-- destroyed the network of the spider aliens<br>-- etc.<br><br>It really depends on what your Maelstrom is like and what the player using Augury wants to do.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
