                    I recently posted an entry on my blog <a href="http://rpgtalk.net/lisap/weblog/251.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> about how I thought RPG's are a social hobby and yet there are so many self-proclaimed anti-social people involved in them.  I got some great feedback/comments but I want more!  *laugh*  So I decided to put the link here as well since not as many folk may read the post and be able to give me any input, ideas, etc. with regards to this issue. <br/><br/>It's just such a noodle scratcher for me that I really want to understand it better.<br/><br/>Lisa P                </div>

<p>Oh, that store thing, it fits my experience to a T. I note in my ever-expanding brain-slot <em>"Etiquette Lost to My Generation"</em> and <em>"Social Skill Lost on My Generation: Smalltalk"</em>.</p>
<p>The status quo's depressing, but whenever I feel I'm in one of those bad shop situations, I do the "Lisa P on 2nd Day" shticks. Just treat the staff like Really Interesting People, trying to make Great Conversation.</p>
<p>The staff at a gaming shop really set the mood for the place. And, since the cultural trope "Gaming is a lonely hobby" is so strong, this Islands-of-silence thing is the default mood for a gaming store that doesn't do anything about it.</p>
<p>Some stores even excel at being bustling, full of people, and yet cold, devoid of social life.</p>

<p>Well, Lisa, I don't see anything terribly surprising in what you experienced.  I wouldn't find it surprising in an RPG store, or a grocery store, or at the beach or on a ski-lift or ... anywhere.  One day you mostly waited for other people to unilaterally break the ice, and it didn't work.  Another day you broke the ice yourself, and got better results.  Isn't that pretty much par for the course?</p>
<p>My dad is <strong>so</strong> good at this.  Going on a ski-lift with him and another skier is like a mini-lesson in getting to know people, <em>every single time</em>.  He's got like five minutes, and by the end he's always saying "Well, Tyler, it was great meeting you!  I hope that infection clears up, and that you and your labrador can enjoy the rest of your vacation.  Ski safe, now, you crazy kid!"</p>
<p>Then I'd go up a two person lift with another person, and we'd both be silent and uncomfortable the whole way up.</p>
<p>I only had to have that lesson repeated a couple hundred times before it finally sank in:  people who will take the first step are rare.  If you are not one of those people then good conversations will be rare (because they will occur only when you encounter one of those people)  But if you are (or become) one of those people then (for you) good conversations will be common.</p>

<p>I agree with Tony, but amend his statement as: people who will take the first step are rare <em>these days</em>. For the last several decades, people in general have become more distrustful of of strangers.</p>
<p>I have a few other random observations that may have a bearing on the topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Overstimulation. Modern city life is increasingly stressful, with lots of required socialization in addition to the relationships you volunatrily choose. As a result, people in urban environments are much choosier about whom they will speak to.</li>
<li>Fear of  <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cat+Piss+Man" rel="nofollow">Cat Piss Man</a>, or of becoming him (or being mistaken for him. No gamer wants to approach a stranger and have their actions mistaken as creepiness, nor do they want the (repeat) experience of approaching a stranger and discovering too late that there's something creepy about them.</li>
<li>Although the majority of people are extroverts, it's my guess that gaming attracts more introverts than normal.</li>
<li>High-end autism, Asperger's Syndrome, Avoidants, Schizoid Personality, and other social disorders may also be more common among roleplayers than among the general population, at least based on annecdotal evidence. The theory is that roleplaying is an easier form of socializing than other methods. However, most of these types have trust issues, which may inhibit them from approaching strangers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I may be completely off here, but those are the things I thought of immediately when I read your blog.</p>

                            The behavior Lisa described is normal in most stores.  In fact, game stores are <em>more</em> social than other stores.  Do you really expect to strike up interesting conversations in the grocery store?  In a clothing store?  In the book store?<br/><br/>Sure, you can strike up a conversation with people in any of these settings -- but the 60-year-old ladies at the supermarket look at me funny when I try to tell them to use glutinous rice instead of instant rice for their chinese food night.  The fact that customers in game stores won't look at you funny for butting in makes the place more social, not less.<br/><br/>Also, throwing around crippling clinical diagnoses without some capital letters at the end of your name is... rhetorically problematic, let's say.                        </div>

<code>I may be completely off here, but those are the things I thought of immediately when I read your blog.</code><br/><br/>I think you hit it head on.  You bring up some good points that I'll have to consider...<br/><br/><code> Do you really expect to strike up interesting conversations in the grocery store? In a clothing store? In the book store?</code><br/><br/>See but here's the thing... that happens to me all the time.  I'm constantly having people talk to me in grocery stores, yarn stores, book stores, music stores, and more.  It seems -only- game stores and comic book stores are where I have this issue this drastically (well at least that I notice).  <br/><br/>Just last week, Eric and I went into Ultimate Comics in Durham.  The guy said "Hello, do we have any comics on hold for you?"  We replied that no they didn't.  The clerk them promptly went into his cubby area (as it really was a cubby) and didn't say another damn word the entire time we were in the store.  <br/><br/>This is why I ask... it just seems like it -should- be a more social place and it's not.<br/><br/>Lisa P<br/><br/>*edited because I kept thinking of things to add*                        </div>

                            Josh, while I agree about tossing around pop-psych willy nilly, I do agree with Talysman's assertion that anxiety about being engaged by or mistaken for a creep  is a real barrier to casual social interaction in any setting.  <br/>
<br/>
I'd argue that in the larger world, for not-particularly creepy people the mistaken-for end of the spectrum, (they "look at me funny") is the larger reasonable anxiety, and that in a gaming store, or at a Con, the engaged-by end of the spectrum prevails.                        </div>

(And anybody, anybody jump in and tell me that I'm dead wrong but) Is it possible that people approach you in public because you're a woman?  My personal experience is that I'm rarely if ever approached in public, and anecdotal evidence bears out that other men have the same experience, but that it's surprising to women.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that this is the result of a cultural stance towards the sexes, rather than any real inherent difference.<br/>
<br/>
How this applies to the gaming hobby, I'll refrain from speculation at the moment.                        </div>

<code>Lisa ... do you have other customers striking up conversations? Or customer-service reps striking up conversations? Or both?</code><br/><br/>It's both usually, but with a bit of a slant towards other customers more than the clerks.  <br/><br/><code>Is it possible that people approach you in public because you're a woman? </code><br/><br/>It could very well be that, that is the case.  But I've seen it happen to Eric too.  Even when he was on the other side of the store.  He's told me about it even when he's out on his own and checking out stores.  *shrug*  But I will admit it happens to me more often than it does to him.   <br/><br/>But see, I thought the same thing... that maybe all those guys in the store were not talking to me because I was female.  But when that other gal came in, I got the same from her and she responded the same to everyone else in the store.  She talked only to her friends and no one else.<br/><br/>On a quick side note- I was just discussing this topic with a gal in my office.  Her slant on it is that maybe because of my years in sales is why it seems odd to me.  She didn't find it that odd at all.  She said she's rather used to walking into stores (of all sorts) and not talking to a soul.  Ever. *shrug*<br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>

                            I realliy dislike talking in stores, even game stores, when I'm shopping. This is because I dislike shopping, I find it degrading, and want it to be over as soon as possible.  I talk a blue streak on busses, planes, etc., though.<br/>

                            I left on comment on your blog, but I'll duplicate it here for discussion: <br/><br/><i>In my experience, tabletop gamers in particular tend to be introverted -- preferring to hang out with a handful of their friends in a structured activity, rather than a big open event like a party or hanging out at a bar.  For example, one of my players is painfully shy.  She's very nice, but she doesn't come to our parties, sticking to structured activities like soccer and our games.  Unsurprisingly, larpers tend to be more extroverted, liking more a big open arena of interaction. <br/><br/>There are gamers who are nastily cliquish, but I've made a lot of good friends through gaming (although never through meeting at a game store... hmm...).</i><br/><br/>On reflection, I suspect my own store experience may have a fair amount to do with my own introversion.  (I also think that many people misestimate extroversion as the norm, simply because they talk to extroverts more in daily life.  Obviously, introverts are less likely to talk to you on the street.)                        </div>

                            I read your blog, and I enjoyed it, and I don't know what to tell you about the specific situations that you were involved with. I can tell you from a retail management perspective  that the clerk wasn't doing a good job if he outright skipped you.  I was an assistant manager at a $25 million a year store with over 200 employees and a corporate line leader responsible for one line over 22 stores for seven years, and from that perspective, I could see that it could range from any number of things from a bad sales associate to a sales associate having a bad day to a customer giving off a leave me alone vibe to anything really. To recognizing a customer from past visits and not wanting to deal with that person... It could have been the day.<br/>
<br/>
We used to have secret shoppers come in and end up reviewing one of our top sellers badly one day and then later, he'd get a good review, or the same day that I observed a sales presentation from a sales associate that was outstanding, they were shopped poorly. It's pretty hit and miss.<br/>
<br/>
From observing some sales pitches or people talking among themselves when another customer would jump into the conversation, like you did with the Bang! guys, I can tell you that their reaction is pretty typical. People in the shopping situations that I've observed get very uptight when a stranger asks a question or jumps in to add an opinion. I should note that in certain areas of the store this was more prevalent than others. On more than one occasion a customer would say to me or the sales person they were with, that guy was weird after they left. Examples: Less Open -&gt; Camping, paddling, optics, knives, gift shop, fishing electronics, collector guns, women's clothing, shoes, bikes. More Open -&gt; Climbing, fishing not electronics, regular guns, golf, team sport clothing, exercise.<br/>
<br/>
The above seemed in my experience to hold true even for employees in the store, but not dressed in their work clothing.<br/>
<br/>
Whether these observations hold true for gaming stores, I don't know. The hobby store I used to shop at in my old hometown of Iowa City seemed pretty friendly. The owners approached everyone, every time I was in their store, and they were always friendly. In my town now, we don't have a gaming store, but of the last couple that I went to, one was overly friendly with a poor selection of games, and the other with the gaming room seemed less friendly and cliquish --- not to mention the really annoyingly loud guy standing right in front of the door and stinking up the place. (No really, he was there. ) But in both places the clerks asked if I had questions the second I walked in. Again, this could just be me too, because I still smile at and sometimes say hi if I get a smile back when I'm in stores -- a habit from retail sales.                        </div>

<p>Grr. I tried to made a post to your blog, Lisa, but apparently my browser ate it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the gist of the comment was, the whole lack-of-socializing thing didn't really seem to be a thing about game stores to me -- more something about stores in general. When I go shopping for books at Quail Ridge or Borders, or run over to pick a head of lettuce up from Kroger or Harris Teeter, I'm most likely not going to get too chatty with the other customers and servicepeople unless I already know them.</p>
<p>But, then again, I'm not known for hanging around in game stores. I've got a pretty limited perspective on the matter.</p>

                            This does vary enormously between stores, in my experience. Three different stores I've visited locally often enough to have a good sample: one is very impersonal and unwelcoming, and definitely has that cliquish atmosphere. Another is busy, bustly, and friendly in that "retailer" way. Customers there are somewhat more outgoing and chatty, but still in that Midwestern reserve way. Third shop is a hole-in-the-wall, but the owner and his wife are friendly, have a great memory for people, and seem to go out of their way to introduce customers with similar interests to each other.                        </div>

                            Ironically, role-playing has immensely increased my social confidence.  I was far more introverted before I got back into gaming in college.  Now I have incredible confidence in my ability to entertain, improvise, listen carefully, respond conversationally, and basically handle any social situation that's thrown at me - even if inside, part of me is still saying, "OMG!!! TALKING TO PEOPLE IS SCARY!!111!!"<br/><br/>I agree with whoever said, above, that someone has to take the first step; I'm pretty successful at talking to people because I'm a 'first-step' taker.  Although I'm quite shy, I'm only shy in certain situations.  I've got no problem striking up conversations with strangers, unless I'm in a situation like a cocktail party where there's nothing obvious to talk <i>about</i>.  But just today, I got into a talk with the guys at the next table at my local coffee shop about a screenplay they're writing, and then got into a half-hour discussion with a staffer at my local comics store about their role-playing section and what he's hoping to do with it over the next few months. <br/><br/>(Speaking of which: NYC folks, Forbidden Planet is interested in expanding their game selections, but the guy who's in charge of the role-playing section isn't sure how to do it, how to tap into the NYC gaming community, or how to make sure the games will sell.  He wanted to talk to some of us about getting indie games in there, but it should probably be someone with more business experience than me because, well, the games have to sell.  Contact me if you want to be put in touch with him!)<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            The trouble with this whole idea is that every bit of evidence is completely anecdotal.<br/><br/>I'd have to say my experience doesn't mesh with Lisa's.  I rarely if ever have conversations with strangers in shops or public situations.  I have on a number of occassions had conversations with strangers <i>in gaming shops</i>, that I have not initiated myself.  Its not frequent, and it wouldn't surprise me to stand in a gaming shop for 30mins and not talk to someone, however.  I just don't tend to have many conversations with strangers.  It's not the way things work round here.<br/><br/>(For the record, I don't consider myself to be at all anti-social. I am confident and fairly talkative)<br/><br/>There are too many factor's here between the highly personal experiences to generalise some principle of gamer anti-socialness I think.<br/><br/>But never the less an interesting post!<br/><br/>Drew                        </div>

<p>I know I'm not talkative at my local game store when "im just dropping in to pick up a thing I've been planning on getting, 'cause I don't have 'talking mode' on then.

<p>When I'm there hanging out, I'm not generally there to expand the clique, but you've made me curious about trying to. I'll experiment and come back with thoughts.</p>
<p>Something that I've bandied about with Josh, and Jon's mentioned similar ideas, is a games shop / comic shop / cafe-lounge, with like low cafe tables and warm dark walls and a library sort of thing and cafe sorts of refreshments and food. I think that a substantial change in the atmosphere of the place - making it a hangout rather than a place of business that accidentally has table space now and then - could have some effect on the socialness of those there.</p>

                            Gamer lounge would be pretty cool, Shreyas, if you could make it not a money sink. As it is, I'm not sure how those LAN party places stay in buisiness.                        </div>

                            First of all, the primary source of income can't be the gaming.  Coffee shop first, lounge second, geek hangout third.  Anywhere that coffee shops work, this place will work.                        </div>
