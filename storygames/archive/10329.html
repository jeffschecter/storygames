It's a disease. (Not my idea, but I can't find a link.)</p>\n<p>It starts out as just a hunger, a vague ache, maybe a wart, but it gets worse and worse. Animals with the disease just keep eating and growing. Their bones lengthen and thicken, and their skin becomes barklike, rippling into gnarled masses or shearing off into plates.</p>\n<p>In the wild, most creatures with the parasite die of natural causes, but those that find a shelter to hole up in can incubate it until it reaches the next stage.</p>\n<p>That's where you get dungeon fauna - dire animals, with their weird growths and their misplaced aggression, are just regular animals with the parasite, with an endless gnawing hunger in their bellies and an unrelenting pain in their stretching limbs.</p>\n<p>After a while, they must return to the surface. The hunger is too strong! Soon they are stories tall, unrecognizable, lumbering beasts. This is the most dangerous stage, where they leave a mindless wake of destruction as they seek more and more nourishment.</p>\n<p>Most tarrasque-infected beasts are put down at this point, but the few that survived it, from prehistory, obscurity, or simply eating everytone that tried to intervene, gradually lose the capacity for locomotion. They become living mountains of flesh, immortal, hungry, and helpless.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
