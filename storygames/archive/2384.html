                    I'm playing in Cinematic Unisystem with one group right now. I'm also considering using Unisystem for a Hellboy game.<br/><br/>Has anyone ever tacked on Keys to Unisystem? Did it work out?<br/><br/>If you were going to do it, how would you go about it? Basically, I have tons of experience with TSOY but little with Unisystem. I don't even know if it is a good idea, but I can't begin to know without talking to someone with more Unisystem experience.                </div>

                            Keys seem like they'd work (for what they do in TSOY) with any system that runs character advancement on small amounts of "improvement points" - like GURPS or Storyteller. <br/><br/>I've used them to replace the "end of session" XP in a game of Hunter, and it seemed to work out fairly well. Characters change as you go, which means you have to be flexible as a GM, but Storyteller is almost as easy as TSOY to create opponents on the fly.<br/><br/>You might have a problem with lacking a Transcendence mechanic, once the characters max out their stats - but that can be negotiated, i'd imagine.<br/><br/>That said, i don't actually know anything about Unitstat!                        </div>

Yeah, do the thing your Key says to do and get XP. Change based on the Key buyoff, and you get paid even more.<br/>

I'm glad to see it can be tacked on to other games with little effort. I wasn't going to bring Transcendence in, thankfully, so less work there.<br/><br/>Andrew Morris might be upset that you've confused Unistat with Unisystem, but I think I know what you mean <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I think it'd mesh fairly well.  As it is, the XP awards in Unisystem are fairly generic and flexible.  It recommends 1 XP per session as base, 1 to 2 per session for conflict resolution (teamwork, combat, creative thought), 1 to 2 per session for staying in character and moving the story along.  And then 1 XP at the end of major story arcs, 1 XP at the end of the "Season Finale".<br/><br/>The only issue I can see is that Key rewards as written (I'm looking at the free Keys download pdf) might let characters gather well past the 1 to 5 XP/session rate recommended in Cinematic Unisytem rules.  From what I recall, each individual XP is worth more in CU than TSOY.  This would result in much faster character power gain unless you tweak the Key returns or the XP costs for advancement.                        </div>

I forgot to mention this: They way i did it with Storyteller was to keep the idea of Key XP translating into advances (at 5 XP per), and then equate each "advance" with a change in a stat dot. You probably have to fiddle with the translation rate to match up with the advancement speed you want...                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>What would happen if Keys fed into Drama Points instead of XP?<br/><br/>Also, how bad would it wreck the system to have characters grow rapidly?</blockquote>
Hmm, good question.  For some character types (the non-White Hats in Buffy/Angel), each Drama Point is actually worth 2 XP so in that respect they're getting even more value.  However, DP are more transient and are intended to flow back and forth.<br/><br/>I think Keys tied to DP would help a couple of things with respect to Cinematic Unisystem.  First being that some conditions for earning them are somewhat setting-specific.  Example, in Buffy and Angel, you're rewarded for making witty quips and snappy come-backs, as to reflect the tone of the television shows.  Putting this into a Key instead (Key of Smart-Ass) could fit better into certain settings.<br/><br/>Second, it puts more power into the hands of the players to determine when they should earn DP and takes a bit of burden off the GM.  For instance, the last Fallout session we ran, I missed several opportunities for awarding DP because my brain was too distracted by planning what was going on and what would be happening next.  I ended up awarding them at the end of session, which is not what I want to do and it's not what I plan to do in the future.  Hopefully.  By giving players more clearly laid out conditions for earning DP, and by making them much more customized and individualized, you're helping them think more about how their character should act instead of relying on the universal DP rules which reward everyone the same.<br/><br/>As for rapid power growth, I don't know.  I haven't run a long-term CU so I don't know that I can comment on that.  Certainly you can always scale the power or number of their opponents, but that might be satisfying only up to a certain point.                        </div>
