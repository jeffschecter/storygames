It's a story game about death, life, roadside memorials, questions, and answers, and it uses scrapbooking as a game mechanic.<br/><br/>If that sounds interesting, register at the <a href="http://kivagames.com/forums/people.php?PostBackAction=ApplyForm" rel="nofollow">Sipapu forums application form</a> and post a message <a href="http://kivagames.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3" rel="nofollow">on the DH thread.</a><br/><br/>We'll be putting more on the site as we have more to put up there; in particular, look for an announcement of a <b>BWBR</b> playtest program (with free beads!) and a game design contest with an actual prize. Oh, and sometime I'll put up a nicer site design.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
