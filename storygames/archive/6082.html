Let's shout out to the people who've been kind enough to take our projects and interests and make them their own. This is good.<br/><br/>Why am I doing this? Because I' have been the recipient of so much undeserved goodness from the community. <br/><br/>Right now I've got three groups playtesting Principia with me. Three! That's a huge embarrasment of riches. Thanks Brandon, John, Phil, Ben, Alexis, Ben, Ping, and Trey. Tuesday's session produced so many good ideas that I was up till 3am making notes. Today Ben's bringing over his Ninja Game to run it for us. And Ben has been playing my dungeon game and giving feedback like crazy too. Also, shout out to Vincent for sharing his games with the community. We had a blast playing IAWA and Poison'd, and we're gratified that we were able to contribute something to the discussion on both. The Seattle community is booming. Every week there's new stuff happening on <a href="http://localrpgscene.org/indienw/" rel="nofollow">The Northwest Circle</a>. We've got Go Play NW coming up in a couple of months. People are running demos and hooking up for playtest sessions. Also, a shout out to Luke, John, Ron, and Dave for getting me started doing artwork for their games.<br/><br/>Edit: Credit the right person for the interview, duh!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135808/#Comment_135808" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T08:37:19+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  8:37AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, this thread is pure win.<br/><br/>I'd like to thank Charlotte for keeping me excited about design, and Jamey for spotting me when there was just too much static in my brain. My guinea pig crew of Alex, Nick, Dan, and Quee is the most diverse array of gamers one could ask for, all shockingly enthusiastic about revising mechanics in media res, tweaking and polishing, all the while developing compelling characters with heartbreaking tragedies. I've taken a design from frustratingly incomplete to playable and sassy in the span of an evening because of the powerful motivation and confidence these guys pour into me.<br/><br/>I'd also like to thank the good sir Hammack for inspiring all the madness I'm working on right now, the Ryans, Stoughton and Macklin, for each reminding me what it is to humbly design for fun, Matt for calling when I needed very much for someone to call, and Mr. Morningstar for bridging that gap between human being I respect and cool guy I know.<br/><br/>And, as always, I'd like to thank my hetero life partner George for listening to me bitch about my game designs and bitching right back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135813/#Comment_135813" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T08:47:14+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  8:47AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomorrow, I get to meet some of my favorite gamers at the Conpulsion convention in Scotland.

Outside of that local circle, I've gotten help in person from Keith S, Luke Crane and Dro Radek (who have been a fucking geyser of Helping Other People), Fred. And folks that have helped me with game stuff from more personal connections (livejournal, emails, etc) like Chad Underkoffler and John Harper, which I reciprocated in kind (Stranger Things, Dead Inside, and SOTC playtesting)<br/>Back in the day, when I was puttering around with nascent design ideas, Ron Edwards and Mike Holmes were big help, but unfortunately I have not helped back so much.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135825/#Comment_135825" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T09:38:39+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  9:38AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ogre is rocking the joint here in Seattle, organizing meetups and demoing lots of hippy stuff to the public and generally being the gamer-about-town.<br/><br/>Sophie and Ed just playtested my <a href="http://bhsow.wikispaces.com" rel="nofollow">Beast Hunters wargame.</a>  It was good and weird: Sophie narrated Ed's Star Destroyer into an impound yard and then Lord Ximu, Ed's megalomaniac sentient probe droid, manufactured a bunch of clone crewers and used them to bust it out.

It's good to remember that we're all human and our shit still stinks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135893/#Comment_135893" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T19:01:56+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  7:01PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2008 7:43PM by Ry.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike Holmes, Paul Tarusov, Lance Allen, Jarrod, Ryan Macklin have all been a huge help in looking at my designs, especially in tolerating my scattershot always-seeming-to-be-designing-something-slightly-different-each-week-even-though-its-the-same-damn-project behaviour.  <br/><br/>*** I almost forgot E Tage Larsen who did up awesome logos for me for play now and TGCHNN.<br/><br/>I owe everybody who has joined <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/play_now/" rel="nofollow">Play Now</a> - I'm glad these games are happening even if I can't find three hours to string together for gaming right now. <br/><br/>I also feel tremendous debt to everybody who contributed to the <a href="http://www.greathundred.org" rel="nofollow">great hundred project</a>, which I've had to take a break from but which really is cool and will only get cooler over time.<br/><br/>I owe Erik Weissengruber, Kate Bullock, Sandy Mackay and Rob 'Valvorik' Harper for showing me there really is a local gaming scene here in Toronto.<br/><br/>Of course I owe Vincent Baker for writing In A Wicked Age.  That game is ridiculously good, and it does so many things I've been dying to make RPGs do for ages.  Also, Eric Provost solved so many of my design problems just by producing Red Box Hack, it's totally brilliant.<br/><br/>But my biggest debt is to Justin D. Jacobson and Andy Kitkowski.  When Luke and Vincent talked about how years ago they found a community that embraced their ideas and really wanted to see them flourish, I thought "That's me, last year."  I never really gave Story Games a second glance, but one day Rob 'Valvorik' Harper pointed me there and I saw <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4311&amp;page=2#Item_15" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.  Instead of having to argue for the design, I suddenly had this tremendous feeling of... <i><b>I'm home</b></i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136046/#Comment_136046" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-23T14:15:13+00:00" title="March 23, 2008  2:15PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a ton of people who help me all the time, directly.  My local crews and my extended circle of friends here in NC.  People who will punch me in the eye if I need an eye-punching.  A wider circle of friends and acquaintances, some virtual and some physical, who I get feedback from and bounce ideas off, and who playtest for me sometimes.  An even wider group of peers, smart people, and mentors whose work informs my own and who make themselves available for advice and commiseration.  Thanks, y'all!  In return, I try to be a public voice for positivity and enthusiasm, I read and critique and sometimes playtest for my friends (not enough playtesting), I have formed relationships with cool people who I am actively helping in various ways.  I'm keeping it sorta vague, but if you're reading this, I almost certainly owe you my thanks and will do my best to return the favor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136123/#Comment_136123" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T10:29:21+00:00" title="March 24, 2008 10:29AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2008 10:30AM by Adam_Dray.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not even going to try to thank all the people whose games I've read and played and from which I've stolen countless fantastic ideas, or all the people who run forums or post inspiring blog entries. I do want to thank specific people who have given me personal time.<br/><br/>Thank you to Jon Eisenstein, just a normal guy (not one of those designer weirdos) who is Verge's biggest fan. He never misses an opportunity to ask me about the game, to jump into a playtest, to spend extra time with me talking about what works and what doesn't.<br/><br/>Thank you to Tony Lower-Basch and Sean deArment, who were willing to playtest Verge with me when it was a very young game, and who weren't afraid to break the hell out of it and tell me why it broke. And suggest really cool fixes. Thank you to Ben Lehman and Joshua A.C. Newman for a late-night playtest that helped me see a lot of problems and solutions. Thank you to Fred Hicks who has a keen eye for fun, and whose playtest comments not only pointed me in the right design directions but also gave me the push I needed to get stuff done. <br/><br/>Thank you to all the other people who have taken time to playtest this game, with me or without me. I have a list somewhere!<br/><br/>Thank you to Ron Edwards who saw something interesting in one of my posts and decided to arrange a phone call with me to talk to me about the design one evening. His advice is always laser-accurate.<br/><br/>Thank you to Nathan Bolt and Lee Cerolis, two upcoming artists who took a chance on me and helped me with interior art. I won't let you down. Thank you to Jake Richmond for a beautiful cover and for putting up with my crazy ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
