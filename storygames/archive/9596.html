Some people agreed to playtest is twice last night, so here's how it went:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, this is a turn based humourous fantasy RPG where the stereotypical Heroes (Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, etc) sit on stage in a court of the Royal Palace and, before an audience of serfs, air their grievances with each other and try to pin the blame for who was responsible for their failure on their most recent quest. Imagine the Fellowship of the Ring going straight onto the Jerry Springer show after getting out of the mines of Moria to sort out who was responsible for Gandalf falling to his death (ok, yes, I know) and you're picturing this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanically, players have a stack of chips in front of them determined by the 'level' of their character and they use these to bid against taking the blame; the basic maneuvers on your turn are to bid a chip into a shared stake then pass to the player on your left or duck out of the current act and take a chip from the stake. Each character type also has some special abilities that allow them to do things like reverse the turn order, raise the bidding, pass directly to a target player and so on. At the end of each act, whoever is left holding the buck must roll an attribute die against the current stake, with their result determing who gets the blame and who gets the credit for what happened in that act.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first playtest involved just myself, Scott Dorward and Robin Poole, so we decided to try a GM-less variant of the rules. The game was very slack and limp though: for those of you who know Mr. Dorward, even he found it hard to get inspired! The story involved a pregnant princess and a potential paternity suit against one of the Heroes, but it developed in a very patchy and uncertain way; it was enjoyable, but not great. Mulling it over afterwards, and comparing it to a playtest of a prior draft played about 3-4 years ago, it was suggested that the GM actually was a vital component of the game, since he provided an audience for the players to bounce their confessions and accusations off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just so happened that, in a nearby room, another group were missing their GM, so we recruited them into a 5-player GMed game and started again. This time it flew: as GM, I was able to add colour in the form of the audience heckling the Heroes and the Magistrate questioning them or suggesting framing for acts &amp; scenes. Also, with more players, the stakes were much higher, making it less likely for any player to succeed at an attribute roll; this created some intense competition amongst the players as they worked to stitch each other up without getting left holding the buck. Also, for some reason, the final act became a bit of a double entendre contest once the idea of stealing an ancient sacred bell called the Great Dangler was introduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few more tweaks and suggestions were made as a result of the playtest, so today I will be mostly hacking away on my laptop...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212826/#Comment_212826" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T05:00:16+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  5:00AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds silly and fun.
