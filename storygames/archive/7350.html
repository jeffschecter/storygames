It's cathartic in a very straightforward manner:  a replaying of the basic fantasy of "If they push me just <i>one inch further</i>, they'll be sorry!"<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters come in worried about consequences and risks ... and then at a certain point they realize that the world is too chaotic for them to defend themselves ... and once they stop worrying about consequences and risks, they become terrifying and wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nTFOS provides simplistic characters who can be <i>hurt</i> a lot, but who cannot be effectively <i>disempowered</i> ... and an environment which keeps throwing more and more stress at them indefinitely.  My reading of <i>Maid</i> is that it does the same, only in a much more directed and explicit way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith both games, the world is deliberately cartoony.  Playing this sort of thing in a more "meaty" world would be pretty horrifying and unsettling.  But in these games, when you totally flip out and your eyes glow red, and you start hunting people with a chainsaw, the response of "Oh no!  Jason-sama has lost it!  We're all doomed!" is fearful in the same way that I'm fearful when my kid decides that he's a monster chasing me ... it's good to be scared, but everyone's actually safe as houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163258/#Comment_163258" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T10:31:17+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 10:31AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Tony.

Ryo Kamiya (Maid RPG, Yuuyake Koyake) and Inoue Jun'ichi (Tenra Bansho Zero, Angel Gear, Alshard ff, Beast Bind, etc.) are among the most innovative game designers there, but conflict resolution, stakes, GM-less games, etc. are still unknown there. On the other hand they've had games with (for example) scene framing and mechanically significant character relationships for a while now. There most definitely is innovation in the Japanese scene, but it's along its own vectors.<br><br>I do, however, think that Maid RPG especially is a game that benefits from a strong GM. Equating the Game Master with the Master of the House is not accidental, and I think the game is at its best when the GM is enjoying role-playing a master who enjoys having pretty maids fawning over him.<br><br>And yeah, the optional seduction rules (for those of you who have the rulebook, they start on p. 69... and totally not on purpose) change everything by letting you more or less become the "Master" of another character with a successful die roll.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>I think the only anime trope that's<em>completely</em>necessary is the idea of the long, slow fuse of temper suddenly exploding into violent action.<br><br>Now ... there's a lot of inside jokes, and I suspect that if you played it with people who were versed in anime and who picked up and ran with those inside jokes (keeping them "inside" to the anime contingent in your group) then that would be really, really annoying.  That's a social issue that I worry about with the game, frankly.  I don't think, however, that it would be a problem with<em>all</em>people who were unversed in anime.  The in-jokes would just be more wierd/meaningless noise in the system.</br></br></blockquote>\nI think Ben and Tony are analyzing the game much better than I could, but I will add that in some places the game becomes *extremely* intertextual. In the case of the item table there were items we had to take out or severely modify simply because very few if any English-speakers would comprehend what was going on. When Kamiya-sensei sent me a list of what items were referencing what, something like 70 or 80% of the items referred to some other anime, TV show, etc. I don't know how necessary knowing about the references it (frankly I suspect I'm too immersed in otaku culture to fully grasp what it's like to be outside of it), but for example if you roll 44 on the Post-Apocalyptic Random Event table, it's certainly helpful to know what the heck the Fist of the North Star is. But outside of the item table, I think you could get away with just re-rolling or reinterpreting anything you really don't get. Make the North Star Assassin more like the Marvel character if you prefer, and run with it.<br><br>On the other hand, for someone who is immersed in otaku culture, being in on the references is one of the joys of the game, and something that RPGs in English have largely neglected to even attempt thusfar.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163318/#Comment_163318" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T12:49:56+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 12:49PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>but for example if you roll 44 on the Post-Apocalyptic Random Event table, it's certainly helpful to know what the heck the Fist of the North Star is.</blockquote>Please tell me this entry wasn't one that was removed or modified, because if it wasn't, you may have just sold me on the game  I'm not hugely into anime and such, but I loves me some Fist!<br><br>incidentally, if i should decide i'm intersted in this game, when/where/how will it be availble to order?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163331/#Comment_163331" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T13:17:12+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  1:17PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say I find the whole concept (including the source material) semi creepy, but I'm always up for subverting things, and I also must admit it sounds really detailed and fascinating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163346/#Comment_163346" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T13:43:49+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  1:43PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2008 1:45PM by Ben_Lehman.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip:<br/><br/>Maid RPG did not evolve in the American RPG design environment.

It's <i>different</i>.<br/><br/>Long answer - and this is from a read, not AP, so take it as you will.<br/><br/>1. It's got a player-GM relationship that's really not quite like anything else I've ever seen. My Paranoia reference above is as close as I can get easily, but it's not quite right. Particularly once you put the Seduction rules into play.<br/>2. Connected to that, the GM has a defined role within the fiction. That's pretty unusual.<br/>3. Random charts. This is territory that is under-explored and pretty fertile. Taking the unexpected and incorporating it is a skill that we don't usually exercise in RPG to this extent.<br/>4. It's sexy (or at least, it can be). Not many games play with that, and VERY few in a comical way.<br/>5. It's a peek into a very different RPG -verse, that's developed largely in isolation from what we think of as the RPG culture.<br/>6. Comedy RPGs are scarce. Good ones are scarcer.<br/>7.

For example, there was an "Akumetsu Mask" item. It's sort of a mask made of gunpowder that lets your character kill herself to eliminate an enemy, and then come back for no apparent reason a while later. Pretty much no one got that it was a reference to a manga called Akumetsu, about a guy who went around killing what he perceived as wrongdoers, and replacing himself with clones each time he died. On the other hand, Andy added a "Desu Note" item, which plays off of Death Note, "weeaboo" fandom culture, and the form in which Suiseiseki (of Rozen Maiden) has become a meme on 4chan, all things far better-known to Americans than Akumetsu. It wasn't that we reduced the intertexual qualities of the game, but rather we shifted them closer to the American audience.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>but for example if you roll 44 on the Post-Apocalyptic Random Event table, it's certainly helpful to know what the heck the Fist of the North Star is.</blockquote>Please tell me this entry wasn't one that was removed or modified, because if it wasn't, you may have just sold me on the game  I'm not hugely into anime and such, but I loves me some Fist!<br/><br/>incidentally, if i should decide i'm intersted in this game, when/where/how will it be availble to order?<br/>That one we definitely kept.<br/><br/>Ordering will be through the <a href="http://www.maidrpg.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a>, hopefully within the next few weeks.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>What if you're an anime fan who has always been creeped out by the Japanese maid fetish?

Will this game be too Maid?<br/><br/>It might be. Sort of depends on your level and type of squick. I think it probably works just fine if you either (a) get all subversive with it, and play it as a <b>send-up</b> of the maid fantasy, where the Master is almost always going to heartily regret his slightest (even unintentional) creepiness (which, incidentally, is a big component of most of the best uses of the trope in manga and anime) or (b) just roll with it and let it be over the top. I think it'd not work so well if you're just unhappy with the concept.<br/><br/>I do think that the game derives a good deal of its humor from the tension in the servant/master, male/female, and labor/management relationships. And, of course, farce. If you take those elements out, I'm not sure you'd be able to find the funny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163468/#Comment_163468" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T18:52:56+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  6:52PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite>Dunno.

Anything you find in Maid you can totally find in say Teenagers from Outer Space (I call Maid a spiritual successor to that game) or TOON (random d66 tables).<br/><br/>I know that some folks from the S-G crowd picked it up and loved it, which is awesome. I've had a lot of fun with this game, with all sorts of players. But the thing is, as expected, the majority of people who bought the game were <b>anime fans</b> (anime fans/RPG players), not people looking for the most innovative game. Probably 80-90% of the folks. People would come up to the game, and Ewen and I could tell within seconds if it was something they'd be interested in or not. Lots of folks just had a chortle, which is totally cool by us. But a lot of folks, a LOT, came up to the table, and we had a conversation like this:<br/><br/>Them: "Oh man, I have to get this game (for myself/my friend told me to get it, etc). I heard about it online."<br/>Me: "Really? Great! If you don't mind me asking, where from?"<br/>Them: "From X"<br/><br/>Where X equaled:<br/><br/><b>Majority</b>:<br/>Gaia Online<br/>4chan's /tg/ boards (and to their credit, they felt much the same about the general atmosphere of the place as I did, so that made me happy)<br/>Anime BBS I've heard of<br/>Anime BBS I've never heard of<br/><br/><b>Minority</b>:<br/>Some RPGNet thread<br/>Your Story Games thread, Andy! BTW, when the hell is Tenra coming out??<br/><br/>I actually expected that to happen, and that made me happy, as if all was right in the world.<br/>I can't sell the game to everyone. And I totally don't want to. I am fine selling this book as a joke, or to folks who want to give it a look but aren't sure if they'd get a group together or not, but I'm just not interested in plugging it as something that it isn't. <br/><br/>The game isn't all that innovative. Folks looking for it will totally be disappointed.<br/>However, it does what it is well: A fast, pick-up game about crazy anime maids and their crazy silly adventures. Later, in the material you realize that you can do dark/gritty tales, realistic tales and the like, but then you also find out that you can go equally in the other direction, with cyberpunk of post-apoc Maids, time-travelling mansions, etc. <br/><br/>Every other aspect of the game works towards that goals: That's what all the randomness is about. Using it is like generating ingredients for the Game Chef contest: Within a few sections - be it rolling up a maid, a mansion/setting, or a collection of events - most folks go, "LOL, I can see that", and boom they're off playing.<br/>The 9 or so scenarios are great fodder for play, or to help people get inspired to make their own.<br/>The REPLAYS appearing in the book, in full, are I believe the first instance ever or full replays making their way into the English RPG world. So that *format* is innovative. And again, it's all about showing how the game is run so people can get an idea of what to expect.<br/>Costumes, Items and the like serve as a double of "get your play moving in crazy directions", as well as "easter eggs for people who have seen some crazy anime/manga". The random items list, more than any other section of the book, is IMO totally "cute reading for folks flipping through the book, not as much use in play as everything else" (although Ewen regularly uses the random tables with great success, I personally don't feel it as much).<br/><br/>I don't want to run Star Wars using this game, but you can totally use it to run cross-genre stuff, where there's one central character and the others serve that character. Harem/Gyakku-Harem comedy anime to the likes of Fruits Basket or Ouran High School Host Club could be run. I totally think that The Wallflower is totally a Maid RPG setup with the main girl as the master, but I also think that that anime is total shit aside from like 2 scenes, so I don't blather about that one much.<br/><br/>Anyway, in game I see cool social stuff happen. GM as Master can be a really fun experience. Player as Master introduces a lot of cool social stuff that happens at the table.<br/><br/>It's really fun, and I'm glad that some S-Gers have dug it (John Marron is an enthusiastic whirlwind!), but in truth, while I love the game and the kind of fun I have with it, and there's room for some cool, perhaps even deep stories (especially if you play up traumas and seduction), it's not really what people on this side of the fence expect.  It doesn't really fall on a plane of "hippy-traditional", which we all tend to look at when looking for the new hottest mechanics, playstyles, etc.  It falls more on a plane of "anime focused/not-anime-focused", which kinda goes past all that. I'm not surprised that folks into anime are picking it up. As Jerry G said, "They <i>get it</i>". Not to say that not "getting it" is bad, it's just different, that's all. I love the anime subculture in some ways (it's VERY enthusiastic and inclusive), and equally dislike it in other ways (very hyper-obsessive, tons of inclusive speech/knowledge and social patterns, etc), and those folks are the ones who seem to get it the most.<br/><br/>Maybe if there's a few AP reports in the next month or two, people will be able to get if they can enjoy the game or not. There is no problem, from my POV, with people waiting months or more to decide if they want it or not. I'd rather folks get it knowing that they want to play it, rather than some "It's talked about on SG" thing (my joke to Tony was "<i>Well, Tony, Ben says that the game is awesome, so you have to buy it. Is that how this works?</i>" :-) )<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163517/#Comment_163517" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T22:03:59+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 10:03PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy and I have different opinions about Maid.

You can totally do a friendlier My Life With Master, or even a creepier one if you want (horror-themed, seduction-based). <br/><br/>I also like the homages to console games like Disgaea. There's an intro scenario where the maids are demons who live in this castle/dungeon for 1000 years, where the has been no master since some incident long ago. The maids are like, dusting the flagstones, feeding gelatinous cubes, resetting traps, etc when a maiden waif, pure of heart, stumbles into the dungeon. The maids all decide (and yes, they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> decide. There is no choice in this matter, no "but I want to stab her in the face!" RP-ing here) that this girl will be their new master, so they both have to help her from the shadows, curry favor, and keep her alive.<br/><br/>It's like a classic adventure, but with bizarre goals, robot/vampire/yakuza maids and random events.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163535/#Comment_163535" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T22:45:52+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 10:45PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Costumes, Items and the like serve as a double of "get your play moving in crazy directions", as well as "easter eggs for people who have seen some crazy anime/manga".

Some of the references you simply will never find in English, and others are largely unknown even in Japan (true easter eggs). One of the interesting ones that I found AND KEPT was called "The Only Neat Thing to Do". In Japan, this James Tiptree short story is the bees knees, and is getting high reads in otaku circles, probably because of the SF-homosexuality-suicide crossover stuff. I totally didn't pick up on it until the author pointed it out to me (and in fact, we mistranslated the title, both me AND Ewen, which is like a one-in-a-million thing, because we didn't know the refernce). I added the author's name to the reference in the English version.<br/><br/>Thing is, you can find summaries and reviews of this short story in Japanese on hundreds of sites. In English, there isn't even a decent summary of the story, ANYWHERE ON THE INTERNET. (!!!) Here's one from one website:<br/><br/>"Coati Cass is a rambunctious teen runaway who discovers: an unseen, unknown species; the trail of two missing Fed scouts; the promise of a miracle; an intimate friendship in the utter void. . . and a nightmare that detroyed the Lost Colony, and threatens all intelligent life."<br/><br/>Here's another:<br/><br/>"A little girl and an alien have a lesbian relationship and jump into a sun".<br/><br/>That's all I could find. So I worked with what I had.<br/><br/>Another section was about giving the maids "Accents". You roll on a chart, your Maid might have an accent.<br/>In the original text, the main references were to Chinese, American, and a few others. Thing is, you can *totally* do a non-offensive Chinese accent in Japanese with the quirky "-aru" suffix, something common to anime and manga (but not real speech, interestingly enough: But it's totally not racist, either). Any way we cut it, leaving that as-is, asking people to "act like a funny Chinese person" would have been fucking horrible IMO. I'd walk out of a game if another player was doing the "Ching Chong Ding Dong" Rosie O'Donell bullshit trying to be "funny". <br/><br/>Also, there is no Osaka accent in English. :-)<br/><br/>Otherwise, as Ewen mentioned, all the original material will be available online at some point for free, if people really feel the need to include them in the random item tables and the like. It'll probably be in 5-6 months or so, once we get done with a million other piddling things. But we will have it online.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163574/#Comment_163574" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T06:38:59+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  6:38AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>So here's the thing: It's really not innovative.

I've studied some languages, though not particularly extensively, and yeah, I know there are concepts that are difficult to describe outside of their language of origin, and there are certainly things that don't have specific words in other languages.<br/>I mean, I like the cow/salmon example.  I was totally on board the first time you used it.  But this time?  we HAVE words for water.  And fins, and gills.  And if we didn't, the concepts could probably be explained, using other words.

And also, there is some definite "this is coming from a Japanese mindset" stuff which can be explained, even in this thread, but there's too much to explain when I could be doing other things. Like, I could turn it into an academic essay, which I just don't want to spend the time doing right now (maybe in a few months, if I have some downtime).<br/><br/>The quickplay (which Ewen is working on, SLOWLY, so don't expect it for a few months) will have some, but not all, of these properties.  Lessee if I can break it down quickly.<br/><br/>Character generation is all random ("roll or choice", but I usually stick with what I get. Although I do reroll if I get cat ears/elf ears, cause I find that uninteresting to my tastes). Chargen takes about 2 minutes, tops. Ewen notes that the only thing you really decide about your character (if you want to do it all randomly: I can also see playing games where "Everyone gets a Magical Power, so roll on that sub-chart") is your character's name.<br/>Basic: Everyone plays a maid, the GM is the master.<br/>Optional: There are rules for butlers (higher stats, but a limit on social things they can do), master PCs (low low low stats, but can command the maids), sempai/head maids (bonuses and drawbacks to relationships), stuff like that.<br/>Random roll tables that help generate events for genre (action, gritty, comedy, romance) as well as setting (fantasy, SF, cyberpunk, Old Edo).<br/>There are replays, and they are varied: The first replay details a "random roll" game with crazy hijinx and even some "funny-sexy" moments. The others show off how scenarios are played, with examples that include deeper roleplaying."<br/>The Maids are rewarded with favor if they do things for the master. It's an Xd6 roll, where X depends on what you are doing (completing a mission, doing something nice, seducing, etc).<br/>If the players are bored with what's going on, they can spend favor to shake things up by forcing random event rolls.<br/>Seduction rules: (optional) there's this economy of relationships, where the Maids can gain stress by losing rolls, but they can form strong relationships with each other to regain stress (or break the relationships to send the other player into a tailspin of anguish and despair). These mechanics are pretty simple, but their results are extremely varied and profound, both to the characters and how the players work. This is the stuff I think Ben is talking about the most when he says that they can't be explained. I can say about this much on them, but more than that basically means writing a few paragraphs (but I invite anyone with the game and some play experience to describe it).<br/>Stress is a mechanic that's central to the game. Normally if you gain too much, your character "freaks out" for a number of real-time minutes ("I'm 7 points over, that means for the next 7 minutes of time (sets stopwatch) I have to roleplay binge drinking"). Depending on the optional rules used, stress could end with the maid being forcefully expelled from the mansion/game, or going into a deep end on a relationship (stalking, attempted suicide, lover quarrels etc). Balancing this with trying to do things, especially with the fact that stats are generally low, takes a lot of creativity. Figuring out how to do things without losing huge amounts of stress, I find tantamount to using a wizard in old-school D&amp;D to use non-combat spells to get past puzzles and encounters in new ways not thought of before. Or doing the Amber style "setting things up so that they happen without a contest" method of roleplaying.<br/><br/>Basically, the game is laser focused not on a kind of playstyle ("all romance/seduction, all the time" etc), but on getting people playing in 10 minutes or less. After that, based on the core and optional rules, there are other things that emerge when you add in rules like Seduction, Trauma, Complexes and the like. They make the game slightly more complicated rules-wise, but definitely deeper play-wise. Not that you're going to be crying by the end of a session or anything (unless it's from laughing too much).

There's a scenario called "Maids Take the Stage." It's in the printed book rather than being a web extra to come out at some indeterminate time mainly because Ben championed it. In it, the maids are women brought to compete to marry a young man who will grow up to wield enormous power. Physical conflict is strictly prohibited, so the thrust of the scenario is the PC maids trying to find opportunities to make a good impression and get a seduction in place on the Master as they progress through a total of 11 randomly-determined scenes of different kinds of housework and encounters. Where a conventional adventure module might have notes on eventualities for if the adventurers can't find the lich's phylactery, this one addresses the possibility that maids might form couples, ignore the master, and in the epilogue get married themselves.<br/><br/>You can play Maid RPG in a relatively traditional style, but a lot of the scenarios point to a style that's more like having some crazy indie game grafted onto it (MLWM and Bliss Stage spring to mind). When I think about it from that angle, I'd really like to see what the Story Games crowd might come up with for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163692/#Comment_163692" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T10:46:09+00:00" title="August 20, 2008 10:46AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Ewen, Andy!

There's obviously a parallel evolution in the way that we talk about games. The actual plays included in the book are very strong and impactful and do not match the way we talk about RPGs over here. If anything, they remind me of the Magic: the Gathering tournament reports that used to be gathered and bound into books back in the heyday.

My thought is that something in the vein of Love Hina would require some extra work and extra playtesting, but could definitely be done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163748/#Comment_163748" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T12:38:34+00:00" title="August 20, 2008 12:38PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe this belongs in another thread, but I just want to chime in on the translation/localization thing.<br/><br/>I work with this sort of material every day (I edit manga scripts translated from Japanese). I'm constantly faced with the question of how to interpret certain passages for an English speaking audience, and I have to make a great deal of judgement calls based on who is the audience for the work, the actual content, and a lot of other factors. Do I include notes under the panels? A glossary? Nothing and let the readers work for it? I do all of these at different times for different reasons. I should also note I speak and read Japanese myself (I don't do the translations, but J-knowledge helps a lot).<br/><br/>Frex, I work on a comedy manga, and there are a lot of gags and puns that quite simply won't work and are meaningless and not funny if presented literally. Some of the jokes even depend on a knowledge of Japanese kanji characters with double meanings. There just isn't a way to get this across with a literal translation. I could just go with the straight literal translation, but trust me, you wouldn't laugh, and if you have to explain a joke, it just isn't funny. So, I or my re-writers have to re-work the joke. We try to keep it in the spirit of the original as much as possible, but if you translate it literally, it makes no sense. The same thing happens with cultural references to things non-Japanese readers simply aren't going to get, like gags based on popular Japanese celebrities and/or their antics which are unknown outside Japan. So again, it has to be re-worked. And since so much of comedy is cultural (while just as much is perhaps, universal) that's just how it goes. It goes both ways; I remember numerous occasions watching comedies in the movie theater in Japan and laughing at the jokes while the Japanese audience around me was silent - the humor just didn't cross over, despite the subtitles (sight gags OTOH, almost always work).<br/><br/>So, my point is, I'm sure Andy and Ewen are facing the same sorts of choices and difficulties when they translate J-RPGs. I'm quite sure they want to preserve the original content as much as possible, but they also need to consider their readership. I haven't seen Maid, but in some cases, I expect they've left some cultural references intact and maybe provided notes, and in other maybe they've reworked it. The audience for the Maid RPG, if they're coming from the majority of the sources Andy cited (anime BBSs) may be deep enough into the anime/manga/J-stuff that they don't need any explanations, but they also need to consider their RPG/S-G audience that may not have this background (the part of the Venn diagram where these two demographics meet is a sweet spot though).<br/><br/>That's my .2 cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163948/#Comment_163948" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T23:48:54+00:00" title="August 20, 2008 11:48PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread was very helpful, thanks!<br/><br/>Now I want to get The Maid RPG and run Shadowrun with it.
