We can play through the scene with a minute level of detail if we want, but we can also kind of skip ahead to resolution without many character choices.  Once we know what you want and have any idea at all of how you're pursuing it, we can resolve.  In my experience, play doesn't speed along with no detail, but it does sometimes jump to resolution as soon as we're clear on what's at stake, with whatever preceded that often being color or set-up.<br/><br/>Now zoom in a little more, let's say Apocalypse World.  We're still looking at what my character wants and how they pursue it, but now we have some varied options or incremental steps that require decisions and can change the options before we answer "Did I get what I wanted and how'd that turn out?"  For example, we can follow a sequence that's just like Dogs in the Vineyard -- start with manipulation, see how that goes; if not good enough, escalate to threats; if <i>that</i> doesn't work, break out the lethal force.  If my character attempts to solve every problem with immediate murder, or if my character's so good at manipulation that they never need to escalate, then perhaps this doesn't play out very differently than Primetime Adventures.  There's certainly the potential, though, that we begin roleplaying and the rules interject at a more minute level.<br/><br/>So now let's zoom in further still.  What about good old fashioned skill checks?  What about attaching probabilities to every minute task you might perform en route to your goal?  I may come back to that, but for now I'd like to try a different angle.  Let's take the same leap from PtA to AW, one where we break "get what you want" into smaller related chunks, and apply it to AW.  Let's break Seduce/Manipulate and Go Aggro and Seize by Force into the interesting decisions that push us, tiny step by tiny step, farther into commitment or animosity or moral hazard.<br/><br/>Help wanted!  Here's my very first brainstorm:<br/><br/>Negotiate - agree on the terms of a mutually beneficially arrangement<br/>Deceive - convince them of untruths that will elicit your desired response<br/>Toy With - manipulate their emotions to the point where they're desperate to do what you want<br/><br/>Threaten - imply or state that lack of cooperation will be met with ugly conflict (verbal at the very least)<br/>Manhandle - push them, corner them, knock them down, grab them, hit them without intent to injure<br/>Coerce - promise death or worse to them or their loved ones for non-compliance<br/><br/>Attack to Dominate - achieve complete control over them<br/>Attack to Wound - hurt them but don't kill them<br/>Attack to Kill - kill them<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455760/#Comment_455760" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-24T04:04:02+00:00" title="August 24, 2016  4:04AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first thought is that those sound like different approaches or different techniques, as opposed to different steps which elicit different decision points.<br/><br/>Is that what you're going for?

The only really useful insight from that, I think, was that under high-stress situations broken down into short time intervals, you could make Observation and Action mutually exclusive, to an extent, such as making decent Observation an option on "choose n" moves.<br/><br/>I think that making Go Aggro a distinct category of submoves is probably not necessary here? After all, it's just negotiation where your leverage is immediate violence. Fictionally, the main difference between Go Aggro and Seduce/Manipulate is that the target of Go Aggro can take immediate physical steps to negate your "promise" of nonviolence. If we're breaking that down into constituent components, then we already have the components of negotiation and violence from our breakdowns of Seduce/Manipulate and Seize by Force.\n<blockquote>My first thought is that those sound like different approaches or different techniques, as opposed to different steps which elicit different decision points.</blockquote>\nThat was my first thought too, but I don't think it's necessarily true.

This would work in games where we're interested in both the character's day-to-day struggles and their broader impact on the world. <br/><br/>I'm picturing an epic fantasy where the choice is between "Do we want to see if Lady Playercharacter convinces the Lord NPC to marry her, or do we want to see if Lady Playercharacter's army conquers this territory?" <br/><br/>Gangster games would work well too.

But, like, 2d6+stat or something. You can use 2d6+stat for everything at all levels of abstraction, but if you want to play a tactical spatial combat game then you'll want mechanics that define how you can move and when you can and can't hit other things with your attacks. If you want to play a game where your character advances over time you need mechanics for gaining XP (or whatever) and what that does to you. That stuff is rightfully specific and probably not very "reusable" anywhere else in the game. Rolling 2d6+stat to see whether you level up isn't as engaging, not in the same way.<br/><br/>Edit: Cross-posted with Potemkin.

The AW MC is more likely to say, "Best way out?  Behind those pillars at the back."  The OSR GM, not bound to give a similarly guaranteed useful answer, is more likely to give a bunch of details and let the players interpret that for themselves.  Props to the AW move for ruling out that situation where the GM goes on and on and doesn't usefully convey <i>anything</i>, but I certainly wouldn't consider it a paragon of zooming in.<br/><br/>One simple tweak to Read A Sitch to zoom in more would be to replace all the questions with more detailed ones, like "What information can I use to determine the best way out of here?" or "What way out of here is most obvious?" or "What here escapes quick and easy parsing?" etc.  Not sure if those'd be satisfying for the current "read a charged situation" trigger, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456011/#Comment_456011" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T00:35:56+00:00" title="September  4, 2016 12:35AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, It's taken me awhile to parse what you're getting at here, and I'm not sure I have it right, but I think it's true, as touched on above, that a couple things are being conflated here that I think could be separated more neatly, namely (1) granularity of focus and (2) granularity of the steps of escalation.<br/><br/>For granularity of focus, Where Dungeon World has hack and slash, you could instead write a set of moves or actions, all related to "sword dueling to the death" like:<br/><br/>Rest your hand on your sword hilt, ready to draw<br/>Draw your sword<br/>Make a quick thrust<br/>Take a defensive stance<br/>Feint<br/>Goad your opponent into rash action<br/>Let loose a reckless series of blows<br/>Turn aside a blow<br/>Circle your opponent, looking for an opening<br/>Try for a killing blow<br/><br/>And you could give them each non-overlapping triggers so they exist as sort of a constellation, without hierarchy. You don't have to do one before the other, in other words. You could also a sort of semi-hierarchical constellation, where success on certain actions provides bonuses to others.<br/><br/>Also, the granularity of what specific action is happening is not necessarily the only vector on which you can "zoom in." Like, you could zoom in on motivation (lash out in anger, lash out in fear, lash out with malice, lash out to protect) or on some other piece of context (fight someone with blond hair, fight someone with brown hair, fight someone with blue hair) without getting into what a specific action looks like "on screen." And I think that's an equally fine focus, just pointed at a different thing.<br/><br/>Or you could have a set of moves, like in Dogs, that represent a hierarchy of escalation, like<br/><br/>When you want something, ask for it<br/>When they won't give it to you, charm them<br/>When they won't be charmed, lie to them <br/>When they don't believe you, threaten them<br/>When they don't fear you, beat them up<br/>When they stand resolute, take their life in your hands<br/><br/>You could also place certain of those moves on the same level with other, hierarchically, like a flow chart:<br/><br/>When you want something, ask for it<br/>If they say no, charm them OR lie to them OR threaten them<br/>If they still say no, punch them OR shove them OR grab them<br/>If they still say no, take their life in your hands<br/><br/>Still really not convinced I'm actually responding well to your premise, sorry if I'm missing something.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456013/#Comment_456013" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T01:29:49+00:00" title="September  4, 2016  1:29AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2016 1:35AM by David_Berg.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like a lot of those ideas, Dirk!

These are both times when we <i>could</i> say, "Okay, whatever, now what do you <i>do</i> with your sword?" but instead, we don't -- we look at the tiny little moments and see, not just what they look like, but also how they matter.

Visual detail is much more my preference -- I would hope to know at some point what my opponent's hair color is, and if some rules remind us to mention that, I'd consider that value added.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456015/#Comment_456015" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T02:06:45+00:00" title="September  4, 2016  2:06AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, cool, glad I'm in the right area.\n<blockquote>...but instead, we don't -- we look at the tiny little moments and see, not just what they look like, but also how they matter. Are there stakes in "rest your hand on the hilt?" Yes, yes there are, if you look closely enough.<br/></blockquote>\nSo, perfect, yes. The function of the zoom is not necessarily to give higher resolution on something we're already looking at, it's more to call out a detail that we'd otherwise breeze past. I'm totally into that.<br/><br/>The question it raises for me, though, is do we want that fine a focus every time someone draws a sword? I can imagine that working in certain more stylized forms of storytelling, but it seems like it would really suck the magic out of those subtle moments if we zoom in every time it happens. <br/><br/>Is there a way to attach some toggles to the zoom? <b>An idea:</b><br/><br/>A deck of cards with moves on them for really zoomed in shit:<br/>Look someone meaningfully in the eye<br/>Lay your hand on your sword hilt, ready to draw<br/>Tell a lie to a stranger<br/>Watch someone from a distance<br/>Search an area, hastily<br/>Etc, etc, maybe 15-20 of them<br/><br/>At the start of each session, draw three of them. Those are the ones in play. When you trigger one, do what it says, then discard it and draw a new one. Maybe some kind of tangible reward for triggering them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456024/#Comment_456024" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T16:04:39+00:00" title="September  4, 2016  4:04PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm torn.  <br/><br/>On the one hand, I am a fan of varying the zoom as per the momentary interests of the play group.

We simply can't travel in slow-mo, no matter how interesting the scenery. Secondly, the conclusion needs to be satisfying. Either both parties back down and we continue to ratchet up the tension toward another moment of conflict, or the conflict is decided with a suitably meaty outcome - who could stand a mexican stand-off where everyone walks away with a few bruises? <br/><br/>If someone wants to float a Seven Samurai scenario, I'll definitely come play. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456086/#Comment_456086" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-08T15:00:29+00:00" title="September  8, 2016  3:00PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to stop in and say that this thread kind of demonstrates what I was trying to get at in the other thread (and was having trouble articulating). Maybe mechanics shouldn't be what we use to get more detail out of a zoomed in scene. Maybe there needs to be an emphasis on helping people describe the scene. The argument for mechanics in the other thread seemed to be a discomfort in the GM deciding too many things on the fly. I'm not sure that's necessarily a true problem. <br/><br/>I will say this though, I think there might be a non mechanical but procedural method to come out of this. Many of the specific mini-actions could become prompts, or questions to tease out more details without having a roll for each one. <br/><br/>Sorry if this off topic, just been looking at this occasionally.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456095/#Comment_456095" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-08T18:25:10+00:00" title="September  8, 2016  6:25PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Have you seen Vincent's "question-based" minigames, from the swashbuckling game he was putting out through Patreon?

I found it very inspiring in terms of game design. It's impressive how you can jump between centuries and very detailed dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>A "zoom-mechanic" I use often: during game-play, each player may propose a "zoom-out/in". If the group accepts, the game-play takes place at a finer/coarser granulity. Example:<br/>1. PCs are attacked by a group of mooks. A player suggests to zoom-out. The scene is decided by a simple resolve die. GM/players narrate outcome of scene accordingly.<br/>2. PCs try to break into a vault. GM wants to resolve this with a simple dice throw. A player suggests to zoom-in and "wait, let's play this scene out in detail". Group agrees and first need to tackle the guards, then the security system etc.<br/><br/>Finally, classical RPG play already uses various zoom levels, i.e.:<br/>Zoom out: Downtime or between campaigns ("hey, let's go to Chicago", "in the meantime, Nancy got divorced and starts a new business").<br/>Zoom in: Social encounters in campaigns ("you encounter a group of travelers", "you negotiate with the local mobster").<br/>Zoom in more: Overcome obstacle ("you climb to the roof", "you find a buyer")<br/>Zoom in more: Move-by-move combat/conflict<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456112/#Comment_456112" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-09T04:12:37+00:00" title="September  9, 2016  4:12AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2016 4:22AM by Dirk.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Dave,<br/><br/>Have you seen Vincent's "question-based" minigames, from the swashbuckling game he was putting out through Patreon?

The lists of questions do an excellent job of prompting and highlighting small moments, and it gives the player control over where/how much to zoom since they're the one picking the questions.<br/><br/>(In summary, there's a script of questions for certain types of encounters wherein players take turns asking each other questions chosen from a list.

That's exactly what the pacing dial I mentioned is for!  <br/><br/>As for Microscope, having recognizably-labeled zoom levels is handy.  I might wanna do something similar when integrating super-zoomed-in play into larger play.\n<blockquote>Archipelago has a "more detail" move that is similar to what's being drawn out here.</blockquote>Yeah!  This thread is an expression of my fatigue with being the only one at my Archipelago table repeatedly hitting that button.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>This is where we can have fun with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly showdowns and meticulously imagined brinksmanship.</blockquote>And Tarantino stuff.

My initial idea of chopping bigger moves into smaller moves probably didn't illustrate that very well; not every component of every action is equally interesting.  That said, I don't expect that calling out the right tiny moments is hard.  It may be as simple as representing them in the rules, and not representing other stuff.\n<blockquote>the conclusion needs to be satisfying. Either both parties back down and we continue to ratchet up the tension toward another moment of conflict, or the conflict is decided with a suitably meaty outcome - who could stand a mexican stand-off where everyone walks away with a few bruises?</blockquote>\nNot sure I follow you there.  I figure the default output of a micro-moment is a relevant change in position.  Which probably does serve to ratchet up the tension just by virtue of having the situation neither end nor turn static.  But "meaty outcome" seems pretty zoom-independent to me, except perhaps that in zoomed-in play it takes longer to get to one.  I am 100% cool with that, in part because of that building tension.  Maybe we're on the same page?

A list of zoomed-in questions to ask sounds fun.  Lemme turn some of our ideas into questions:<br/><br/>- How close does your hand get to your sword hilt?<br/>- How do you phrase your threat, word for word?<br/>- As you peek around to glance over the room, what do you expect to see?<br/>- As you begin the seduction, where do your eyes go to?<br/>- What part of your body do you use most to sell your feint?<br/><br/>Hmm, yeah, I could see a list like that being constructive.  It allows the game designer to specify things like nuance and degree which are worth making it into the fiction but aren't traditional triggers for mechanics.  Although, I guess an asked question from a list is in fact an opening to roll some dice.  I wonder if it'd be fun to define outcomes relative to what's described?\n<blockquote><i>How close does your hand get to your sword hilt?</i><br/>Answer, then roll.<br/>Good roll: they think it's farther than that<br/>Okay roll: they see that<br/>Bad roll: they think it's closer than that</blockquote>\nUgh, that's a weak example.  Let's try again:\n<blockquote><i>As you peek around to glance over the room, what do you expect to see?</i><br/>Answer, then roll.<br/>Good roll: you notice features both more and less favorable than that<br/>Okay roll: you see that, to the extent that that's plausible<br/>Bad roll: you effectively see nothing, as the clash between reality and expectation is too jarring for a glance</blockquote>\nI dunno.  Still seems like maybe "when you bring your hand near your sword" and "when you try to assess a space with a quick glance" would be better.  What applicable upsides did you see to the "it's a question" aspect of Vincent's thing?\n<blockquote>"I press in close, our blades pressed between our bodies; what do you whisper to me?"</blockquote>I guess in a "tell a story" (as opposed to "embody a character") game I might like this.  And I guess zooming in for detail could be a tool for that sort of game.  So I'll try to keep an open mind.

It's effectively free points for zooming in, which is exactly the kind of mechanical incentive I hoped we'd come up with here.<br/><br/>I think there might be a tricky balance here -- we don't want players taking on boring drudgery for the sake of success -- but as long as the "zoom for points" options are also enjoyable, then we're probably good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456141/#Comment_456141" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-10T07:23:05+00:00" title="September 10, 2016  7:23AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think there might be a tricky balance here -- we don't want players taking on boring drudgery for the sake of success -- but as long as the "zoom for points" options are also enjoyable, then we're probably good.</blockquote>\nIt might self-balance. If a player cares enough about success to go through "drudgery" to get it, it's probably worth spending the time on. You could also require that everyone at the table agree to the zoom, and judge if the descriptions are adequate, so if someone else thinks they're cheesing it doesn't happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456147/#Comment_456147" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-10T15:00:12+00:00" title="September 10, 2016  3:00PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One potentially interesting way to handle that would be to make the "zoom in" an action which can happen more or less, depending on the participants wishing to make it so.<br/><br/>For a simplistic illustration, you have four "levels" of zoom, and any given player can only "zoom in" by one level.

And you could effectively choose to "zoom in" by choosing certain questions. Each one adds detail to the fiction and then demands further detail. They were also always two-part - one player adds one thing, the responder adds another. So, that's nice for interaction.<br/><br/>I'm totally with you about "being the only person to ask 'more detail, please', over and over again".

If a description isn't actually zoomed in, then you can't benefit from it.  Cool.\n<blockquote>. . .  any given player can only "zoom in" by one level. So you only get the fourth level when three players all agree it's necessary . . . It could be more granular, though, like spending points or choosing game actions which add detail. Each player who does it "magnifies" the action view.</blockquote>Hey!  Idea!  What if any action/question can be pre-empted by a more zoomed-in action/question?  So as long as you can form a meaningful question to ask, or identify an action which can be rolled, you can continue to zoom in, in the hope of playing to your own strengths.  <br/><br/>My socially skilled guy and your combat skilled guy are about to have a knife fight.<br/><b>You:</b> I try to stab you!  I'll roll +Melee.<br/><b>Me:</b> Wait!  As you begin to move, you notice a fierce look in my eyes!  I'll roll +Intimidate.<br/><b>You:</b> Wait!  My knife-drawing is actually faster than conscious thought or recognition -- I might complete the strike by reflex before I've even registered your glare!  I'll roll +Speed.<br/><b>Me:</b> Wait!  In the microsecond where your hand grasps the knife, even though you don't consciously notice it, the aura I've brought to the interaction we just roleplayed is putting a tiny crimp in your usual fluidity.  I'll roll +Charm.<br/><br/>So then the Charm roll goes well, granting a penalty to your Speed roll.  You now have to incorporate that into your narration.<br/><br/>The Speed roll goes well despite the penalty, so you say, "As my left hand gestures while talking, my right hand slips unnoticed to my back pocket.  My fingers clasp the blade's handle, but initially slip, and you see beads of sweat.  This isn't normal!  Clearly this interaction has me off balance.  On the second effort, though, trained reflexes prevail, and the blade is out and moving forward faster than the eye can follow."<br/><br/>So then I have a penalty to my Intimidate roll from your Speed.  I roll poorly.  I say, "There will be an utterly chilling look on my face, I assure you!  But you won't notice it until you've completed your attack."<br/><br/>Then, finally, you roll Melee -- unmodified, because my Intimidate failed, thwarted by your Speed.  You roll well, and stab me, and you narrate that, and then you narrate how you notice my glare immediately thereafter.<br/><br/>Could be interesting, right?  We'd have to outlaw "before that" pseudo-zooms, though -- to pre-empt, you actually have to look at a <i>smaller</i> increment of time, not a <i>prior</i> increment of time.  And to agree on what that means in context, we have to agree that "I try to stab you!" includes drawing a knife in the first place, etc.  I think it'd probably come down to what's been narrated before the first action that proposes a roll.  If we already roleplayed your quickdraw and my stare before you ever said "I'll roll +Melee for the stab", then maybe zooming in is no longer an option.<br/><br/>Selene, I'm curious how close this might be to how you envisioned your shifts in zoom working.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456155/#Comment_456155" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-10T16:46:39+00:00" title="September 10, 2016  4:46PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2016 4:46PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, Vincent's thing sounds neat!

I'm not sure how to keep it from just happening for every action, however. Perhaps if there was also a penalty cost to doing so unsuccessfully, and the faster action got a bonus? (So that, for example, trying to forestall someone stabbing you by talking to them could theoretically work but would be hard to pull off and disastrous if it failed...)<br/><br/>WmC questions/responses are good a <i>adding to the fiction</i> - we build new material. "Here's another thing we can talk about!" They move things forward, for the most part. More material isn't necessary "zoomed in" - it could also push us forward ("Ok, so once you make it around the corner, you see a car which could get you there much faster!" -&gt; both skipping over the current moment and offering a faster way forward to the next moment.) Vincent's questions are more about "zooming in", however - they forestall action by forcing us to answer specific things first. In other words, you have to go through "I pull you close to me. Do you whisper in my ear or push me away?" before you can get to your desired outcome (like stabbing the opponent). That's why I thought they were relevant to this particular thread.<br/><br/>I think a very interesting hybrid of those two things could really work, though!

Distinct zoom levels could i.e. have their own mechanics on each level. A seamless zoom in/out mechanic could be used flexibly in various gaming situations by GM and players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456185/#Comment_456185" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-11T20:02:35+00:00" title="September 11, 2016  8:02PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Legend of the Five Rings RPG's <a href="https://philgamer.wordpress.com/2010/07/29/lets-study-l5r-4e-the-art-of-the-duel/" rel="nofollow">duelling rules</a> come to mind.

Could be a fight, an argument - whatever the rules are supposed to adjudicate.<br/><br/>* Each player has a certain amount of resources, which they spend on rolls. It's helpful to spend it, but you have to be careful when and how much - it's not easy to replenish. There's a cap for how much you can spend on each roll.<br/><br/>This means that the more rolls something involves, the more expensive it's likely to be (at least, if you're interested in winning).<br/><br/>* When the conflict starts, the attacker/initiator may name up to three Details (you may name none at all). Details are statements of fact about the fictional space/situation which could be involved in the conflict. <br/><br/>In the case of a physical fight, Details can be tactical positions or environmental details. (1. "There is a fire extinguisher on the wall." 2. "The left corner of the room is the only area uncluttered enough to freely swing a weapon." 3. "It's starting to rain, making the floor slippery." 4. "Two startled but hungry-looking Venusian lion-beasts are watching from about 50 feet away.") <br/><br/>* The defender/target may now similarly name from zero to up to three Details.<br/><br/>This means that any given conflict will have from 0 to 6 Details, but with neither opponent controlling the total number of Details involved.<br/><br/>* Once the conflict begins, you may try to gain an advantage against your opponent by interacting with each Detail. A Detail can end up in your favour, against you, or neither.<br/><br/>For instance, you might try to grab the fire extinguisher, or scratch your opponent, releasing the scent of blood into the air and attracting the lion-beasts.<br/><br/>* Once all the Details have been dealt with in some way, the next roll resolves the conflict.<br/><br/>This means that if you want to spend time and resources on a conflict, you should name more Details. If you don't, you should name none.<br/><br/>A simple contest no one worries about will have no Details, and resolve in one roll.<br/><br/>In a complex/weighty contest, though, you'll have six Details, which means it will take seven rolls to resolve, and probably lots of resources spent by each party.<br/><br/>(Ideally, interacting with Details would be optional, but weighted somehow, so you would want to interact with those that are relevant and likely to help you, but ignore those which are a stretch or not likely to be in your favour.)<br/><br/>This does a lot of things we've been discussing in this thread - add fictional detail to our shared imagined space, make players consider the actions of their characters in more detail, get us to describe more of the blow-by-blow, and lengthen the process of playing out the sequence.<br/><br/>I like how the checks &amp; balances work against each other, so long as the particulars of the moves, rolls, and resources are well designed.<br/><br/>However, it's also limited to conflict situations and two parties. I would love to see more "technology" for creating more flavour and detail in more general "free play" - those are rarer, in my experience. Sign in Stranger does this well by making all the players fundamentally <i>curious</i> about those details, and then making it <i>fun to find out</i>. But, by the same token, you can easily ignore that once you've moved on to other concerns - I'd imagine that after a month on a foreign planet, no one is too concerned about the colour of the flowers growing beside the landing pod anymore.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20752/zooming-in-via-mechanics" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20752/zooming-in-via-mechanics" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20752/zooming-in-via-mechanics/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20752%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20752%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
