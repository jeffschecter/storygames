                    (Given a tag so the idea can be reused.)<br/>
<br/>
This is most obviously relevant to <i>Exalted</i>, but certainly shouldn't be considered exclusive to it:<br/>
<br/>
Let's discuss how the genre of heroic epics and how to emulate them through play. Interpret this broadly: as designers, GMs, and players; viewing a game through the lens of the genre; viewing an instance of the genre through the lens of a game; going into side-discussions about the genre on its own (though trying to pull it back into play, when possible.) Here are the things that the [Genre Workshop] thread wants to do:<br/>
<br/>
1) Deepen our understanding of the genre: identifying the neccessary elements of the genre, identifying common tropes of the genre, identifying sub-genres (the Old Testament is not Homer is not Itihaasa, &amp;c.), learning more about the classical instances of the genre. Post a summary of your favorite heroic epic, with commentary focused on things of interest to play, or link to a summary and commentary that you favor.<br/>
<br/>
2) Apply that to play situations. Which is the whole point, of course. Specifically, mechanisms, whether as tips to the players, or to the GM, or things a designer (or GM imputing houserules) can do. Trope --&gt; Tip is the simplest way to go about this. This discussion is semi-inspired by an idea of Pseudophedrine's posted to RPGnet, wherein he said he gives all mooks names and makes sure to put them into the narration to produce a more Homeric feel.<br/>
<br/>
(It goes without saying that all proposed mechanisms should be subject to criticism of a friendly nature. Or at least here on S-G it goes without saying.)<br/>
<br/>
3) Raise issues to be adressed by the above/ relate actual play experiences where you were attempting to emulate the genre/ &amp;c.<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Basically everyone here is smarter than I, so my contribution will be more questions than answers. 2, 3 and 4 are also mainly <i>Exalted</i>-related; feel free to translate the terms into those of the game of your choice/take the opportunity to pimp the awesomeness of your game of choice in its handling of said issue.<br/>
<br/>
1) More than other genres, epic poems have a very strong presumption that the events take place in the past relative to the reciter. Is narration in the past tense a good way to approximate this, or is that just too weird? Are there strong reasons to adopt third-person narration for players or is that just too minor an issue to matter?<br/>
<br/>
2) Epic heroes are mammals. Epic heroes flip out and kill people and/or do generically stupid things out of passion. In <i>Exalted</i> we have Limit Breaks to cover this, but what additional tools (whether formal rules or just GM's techniques) can be used to get their timing "just right?" Sometimes a Limit Break creates a scene on its own - Akhilles' Valor in itself demands that people respond - but others require more precise timing - Arjuna's Compassion going off at any time other than the Critical Battle would be kind of lame. Should there be some sort of incentive for one's character to fuck herself over? Something else?<br/>
<br/>
3) For an actual play example of the genre done spectacularly right, I figured I should link to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=6187411&amp;postcount=44" rel="nofollow">this</a>.I'd quote in full if not for post length restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
The author, for the record, reccomends stringently applying the Virtue and Limit Break rules to get the given sort of result.<br/>
<br/>
4) For the game I may or may not be running, I'm replacing Motivation by Intimacies in the following way:<br/>
<br/>
a) No Motivation, but more Intimacies: A starting number of "I love (individual person)" Intimacies equal to Compassion, a number of "strong belief/social ideal" intimacies equal to Conviction, and a number of "I hate (individual person)" intimacies equal to Conviction less Compassion.<br/>
<br/>
b) Max number of Intimacies in each category equal to [Willpower + starting formula], like for all Intimacies under old system.<br/>
<br/>
c) Whenever your character comes across somebody, you can declare that they retroactively know each other, take an Intimacy, and describe their story - why she loves or hates him. You can also say that they've never seen each other but she falls in love with him at first sight, adding him as an Intimacy.<br/>
<br/>
Does this seem about right? Does taking out Motivation break the engine of player-drivenness? Should I fit them into the experience system and make them more fully Key-like?                </div>

<p>Can I reply to this in the form of a link? <a href="http://njyar.thesmerf.com/goldenchain.html" rel="nofollow">The Golden Chain</a> (lame working title PLEASE HELP) says of 1 (and sort of implicitly of 2, because I tend to think of story forms as kind of poorly-described play procedures):</p>
<p>Trope: There's a subgenre of hero epics that are identifiable, superficially, by a certain kind of audacity and use of ritualised language. People and monsters are mammals, and mammals flip out and <em>say horrible things to each other.</em></p>
<p>TGC is pretty straight-up about this, forcing you to speak in formulas and ritual epithets more or less constantly. I think your idea of speaking in the past tense is worth trying, but it is a little delicate without the support of a less subtle procedure; that's why TGC has you open the game with the tonesetting declaration of threats:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Left-Hand Hasan chooses Rainwater Jaguar as his enemy, and declares, <em>"Rainwater Jaguar, you have devoured Layla-and-Ferzeen-whom-I-loved-in-the-nighttime, and for this I will tear you open with my hands and free them from your shredded bowel!"</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>To this, Rainwater Jaguar answers, <em>"I have already eaten every one of Ferzeen's bones and made soup of Layla's tears, young Hasan, and you I will roast on the stones to feed my cubs!"</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The forced structure of this is intended to get you thinking in that mode of talking.</p>
<p>Trope: There is no hero without a <em>thing to be a hero about.</em> (This is sorta what Motivation is in Exalted, but not all the way, I think...)</p>
<p>In my made-up instance of the genre, all the heroes are interrelated; when one hero messes up, that's what causes someone else's treasured thing to be destroyed by a monster that already exists, which makes him take up arms and be a hero. Sometimes a hero fails badly enough that the things he cares about turn into monsters.</p>
<p>Trope: Heroes are messed up. In Sol Invictus, we found, after many sessions of unintentionally not using the Virtue and Limit Break rules, it didn't matter; I will dig up the thread in the morning...</p>
<p>I think that Motivation is a flag, and like all flags, I don't think you need such a thing in a group that already communicates its desires and interests effectively.</p>
<p>Sorry about the poor structure of this post; I am sleeeepy...</p>

                            I understand that this might just be the lit student in me talking, but I would pay money right now for a mechanic that supports the creation of epic similes in play. I seem to remember Exalted having stunts -- one possibility could be that stunts must be described in terms of an epic simile. But that seems weak, compared to a mechanic created specifically to harness the awesomeness of a twenty-six line comparison of our hero and a duck.<br><br>I think this would be most appropriate as one of many techniques that aim at altering the way players speak about the action and about their characters -- which would obviously only appeal to certain groups, since a lot of people get very stressed about having to come up with good narration "on the spot." Requiring that they follow elaborate literary conventions with which they may not be familiar and which they certainly have not internalized would probably make this worse -- though in some cases having strong mechanical guidelines about how to speak can help a player struggling with that same issue.                        </br></br></div>

                            Alright, what I say no pertains only to Greek and Roman epic.<br><br>Things that come to my mind:<br><br>1.) Focus on the physical world. <br>In epics there is only few information on what a character feels or thinks. There is nothing like inner monologues or describing the world from a character's perspective. If a character's emotions are mentioned at all, they are simply stated - often connected to a resulting action. (This epic objectivity weakens over the time. Where there is almost no subjectivity in Homer, you will find more in Hellenistic or Augustean times.)<br><br><br>2.) Great detail vs. brief description<br>Sometimes an object is described over several pages. Sometimes lage parts of the narrative are done in one or two sentences. This is possible because the reader is exspected to know the story already. Comparisons to other myths are also a common feature.<br><br>This might be particularly difficult in RPGs.<br><br><br>3.) The catalogue<br>This tradition started in the Iliad where Homer names all the Greek ships. Catalogues of heroes entering battle are also common. Ovid makes a fun of this in the Metamorphoses where he names all of Actaeons hounds, which then devour him after he was enchanted by Diana.<br><br>Maybe this technique can be used as a kind of brainstorming in RPGs.<br><br><br>I'll think about this topic a little more. No it's time for PtA.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yes, I like what Stefan's saying: especially about the detail. In a game situation, there ought to be some sort of reward for describing not just a "dawn" but a "dawn, fresh and rosy-fingered".<br><br>What strikes me about, say, the Odyssey, is how non-linear the narrative is. Often, there's a huge flashback where a completely different story is told: the episode of the Trojan horse is told entirely in flashback. It's perfectly normal, when introducing a character, to tell a story to introduce him. So, again, in a game situation, you'd want this non-linearity: you can interrupt the scene you're playing to tell the story of <i>another</i> scene, long ago. That flashback scene should probably add traits to your character (or something).<br><br>What else? You'd want the interaction with the gods: so that the gods takes sides in your conflict. And you'd want fate to play a part in it too.<br><br>There were a couple of Greek Epic RPGs in the last Game Chef: Warren Merrifield's <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Champions_of_the_Gods.php" rel="nofollow">Champions of the Gods</a> and Per Fischer's <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Hubris.php" rel="nofollow">Hubris</a>.

                            On the subject of hexameter, I'll repost from a May thread where I mentioned my game in progress wine dark sea (and I'm glad icecream emperor is in the house). It's not supposed to be an epic game, more a post-epic, but still may be relevant.<br><br>"If players 'speak in hexameter' in describing actions they get bonuses to resolution rolls. <br><br>Dactyls etc. seemed too complex and fine grain so I'm using a simplistic version of hexameter. To receive bonuses, you have to state a sentence with six main elements (as in the six metrons or feet of a line of verse.)<br/><br/>Names count as one element. Major parts of speech each count as an element. All people and creatures in the game have Homeric epithets like 'Hector, breaker of horses.' Players have to include an epithet every time they name their character in a sentence. Epithets take up between one and three spaces in a sentence depending on their length. <br/><br/>Example: say that Odysseus has three epithets of different lengths:<br/>rugged (1)<br/>Sacker of Cities (2)<br/>Zeus's equal in his mind's resource (3)<br/><br/>During the game, his ship hits a reef and begins to sink. Here are 3 possible actions that combine his name, action description, and epithets that total 6 elements.<br/><br/>Odysseus (1), Zeus's equal in his mind's resource (3), Swims (1) to shore (1)<br/>Odysseus (1), Sacker of cities (2), rescues (1) his men (1) with ropes (1)<br/>Rugged (1) Odysseus (1) dives (1) to sea floor (1) to retrieve (1) provisions (1)<br/><br/>Hitting this hexameter zone gives you an automatic bonus dice and lets you activate any advantages associated with the epithet you included. (For example the rugged epithet might include a bonus you could use for Odysseus holding his breath under water.)<br/><br/>You can also narrate using your opponent's name and epithet and gain access to the epithet's disadvantage. Example, Odysseus and his crew are being pursued by an angry mob, so the GM narrates: <br/><br/>Bow-legged (1) Odysseus (1) waddles (1) as fast as he can (1) but still falls behind (1) the other mariners (1)<br/><br/>Credit for urging me to try to use grammar in some way in this game goes to the person who posts with the screen name emperor of ice cream"                        </br></br></br></br></div>
