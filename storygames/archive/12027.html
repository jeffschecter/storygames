While this can be a pretty tall order, it may just be a matter of having a simple dice mechanic, and boiling down actions to like five or six different broad abilities. That way, no matter what a child might dream up, they can define it as "an attack," or "problem-solving" or something like that.<br/>In a way, story games are perfect for this, since they already think outside the "box." D&amp;D and other more mainstream games, though, often try to place too many definintions and exceptions to things (move THIS far, can use this EXCEPT when..., affected ONLY by...).<br/><br/>Again, this is only my opinion...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269457/#Comment_269457" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T10:28:50+00:00" title="April 29, 2010 10:28AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kids do think outside the box.

Playing with them is inspiring imagination-wise, but can be challenging in the retain-their-attention area.  <br/><br/>Eppy &amp; I are working on a game for kids and adults to play together: Dread House, using the jenga tower for pulls to see if your character gets scared and runs out of a spooky haunted house before dawn.  We've played it with kids, who have loved it, but when the game ran over 2 hrs, we started to lose them. This game straddles the board game &amp; rpg line, too, which gave it a lot of structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269466/#Comment_269466" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T11:52:03+00:00" title="April 29, 2010 11:52AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wburdick</cite>A friend of mine plays "Warriors" with his kids and they like it.

Having an RPG as a promotional item, rather than a core, sellable product in its own right just plain makes sense to me, and has a whole bunch of advantages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269508/#Comment_269508" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-29T17:26:55+00:00" title="April 29, 2010  5:26PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting -- I hadn't thought about that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269530/#Comment_269530" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T01:37:04+00:00" title="April 30, 2010  1:37AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wburdick</cite>Interesting -- I hadn't thought about that!</blockquote>\nItr opens up a lot of possibilities, and also removes a lot of constraints at the same time.<br/><br/>For one thing, the game part doesn't have to be perfect or even complete.<br/><br/>For another, it can be short and even a bit vague <i>and that's okay</i>.<br/><br/>For a third thing, whatever game you come up with doesn't need to be definitive. A given property could have one or three or ten games related to it, each a bit different and focussing on a different aspect of the property. And each game could be short and focussed and still true to an aspect of the property.<br/><br/>Last, it opens up the game design on the property end in the sense that a designer no longer has to either buy rights to the property and gamble on acceptance by a paying public. That's all off the table. One need not write something like Redhurst Academy and promote it; Instead, you just write a Harry Potter game and get a check cut by the company for your efforts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269551/#Comment_269551" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T07:59:44+00:00" title="April 30, 2010  7:59AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's good to see a book publisher pioneering like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269597/#Comment_269597" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T19:57:03+00:00" title="April 30, 2010  7:57PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only drawback of that model is that one must be a good writer in order to draw any interest to the RPG adaptation.

At 4 she was playing Warhammer Quest, which is pretty easy to play (move and swing) but hard to win.  Back then attention span was an issue - we'd play for 15 minutes and then she'd be more interested in stacking the dice into towers.  This is before she even knew what death was.  ("you knock him out"). Just recently we've been playing Faery's tale which has a lot of good advice for playing with different ages.  She's almost six now and in a sore loser phase - play Sorry with her?  Forget about it.  So faerys tale suggests diceless and that works pretty well - "you can't hit him"  <br/>\nWe can use dice whenever the stakes are low, like if the faerys are in a tournament or something.<br/>\nUsually I ask first - "do you want to roll dice to see who wins?"<br/>\nOnce with FT she chose to use the last of her essence and fall into magical sleep to save the day - that was pretty awesome - but I don't think she could handle it if it was done to her.<br/>\nShe's usually passive "what happens next?  What happens next?"  but sometimes if I tell her "I'm out of ideas.  What do *you* think happens next?" she'll come up with some cool stuff, like:  "I draw a picture of a cat and it becomes real."<br/>\nshe loves character sheets - she likes writing down her abilities and drawing pictures of her characters.  <br/>\nThere's a couple "RPGs for kids" web sites that have advice that I've found to be really true, like:  kids love to pretend already, the hard part is getting conflict and dice in.  So sometimes we'll play "soldier" and pretend to shoot aliens (tranquilizer bullets, I tell her) and then we'll roll dice a la 3:16 to see how many we got.<br/>\nShe likes universalis, too - she likes bidding for scenes but usually doesn't know what to do once she's won - I've gotten carried away a couple times "the wizard banishes your cat to another world" and made her cry - it's tough to tell what negative outcomes will set her off and what she's ok with, so lately I always ask first.<br/>\nSo... That's my report on gaming with 5 year olds.  I think my daughter's pretty awesome, obviously.  (yesterday she asked a friend of ours "do you play role playing games with *your* son?").  My biggest problem gaming with her is that *I* get bored much quicker than she does:  if you can make a game that's as engaging to me as, say, Fiasco, without scaring her off, big win.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jamie                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283573/#Comment_283573" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T15:33:55+00:00" title="July 29, 2010  3:33PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Bill, that Warriors game looks pretty neat.

At that age they want explicit rules, since they don't have the experience yet to make judgement calls, and it would be up to the book to make it for them. That's one area in which computer games work really well, is there's no arguing with the computer, although in multiplayer there's accusations of cheating. If you have a very flexible framework for the game, there's always going to be a problem with cheating. That's also where having dice rolls for everything, and very limited GM judgement calls help. There's no thought that the GM is playing favourites, and any bad result can be blamed on the dice (therefore not ruining friendships). If we're looking at combat, keeping it simple, Final Fantasy 1 style helps, because it's just an attack roll, you know it's coming. If you have strategic combat going on though, a player could again feel their character is being singled out. Combat focus is also itself satisfying for kids since they're always told they're not allowed to fight in school, so it's something where they get to be grand heroes saving the day, rather than kids being told what not to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283941/#Comment_283941" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T17:40:34+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  5:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've looked over the adventure and I like it.

The monsters are also all quite interesting, each with a unique special ability. I'm also quite fond of the running the adventure advice - monsters attack characters with high hit points first, and don't attack the same character twice. That specifically touches on how kids can feel like they're being singled out if their character always gets attacked.

"A spiral staircase grows out of the forest and goes to a treasure box in the clouds."  "There's only one alien around the corner - I think I can hit him."

Cases in point:<br/>\n<br/>\n- We have a home corner, which is a collection of child-scaled play furniture and utensils, such as a toy fridge, oven, washing machine, etc. They will happily play houses and shops in there all day without any kind of adult input at all. By contrast, we have a whole cupboard full of boardgames, but they won't ever play those without an adult supervising to make sure the rules are used... though they do often grab the money out of the Monopoly to use in their games of houses/shops.<br/>\n<br/>\n- One of the games that a particular group of children always ask me to play is 'Monkeys', the rules of which are: the children are all monkeys and I'm the zookeeper. From this set-up, the children create tales of the monkeys escaping, dying, having children, being scared of visitors, accepting new monkeys into the zoo and so on, all with me following their lead and playing along with what they want to happen. If I ever try to inject any kind of order, logic or 'rules' into the proceedings, I generally get ignored, which is fine as I shouldn't be adulerating their play anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you're looking to get children into role-playing, then I think the more narrativist it is, the better: children want to create and imagine, not to be told "Your character can't do that."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284010/#Comment_284010" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T12:56:11+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 12:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hi Jamie,</p>\n<p>I'm forwarding you the PDF as soon as Gmail lets me in (don't know what's up).</p>\n<p>Kindly forget the somewhat...precious...working title.

I guess it wasn't exactly her first introduction to RPGs - we were telling Airbender fan-fic with homebrew traditional stuff of mine before that - but Faery's Tale is the closest she got to real roleplaying and her longest running campaign - we played every scenario we could find and made up some of our own.  If it had more modules or some sort of oracle for random scenario generation we might still be playing it, but we both ran out of ideas and then she discovered Harry Potter so our play turned to Hogwarts.

There were a number of FT adventures and supplements that were written, but never published. My business partner and I have permission to publish them. I like the idea about an FT Oracle.. Hmm.. will have to give that some thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286461/#Comment_286461" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T12:51:40+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 12:51PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard didn't go well the last time we played it with a child.  She had no patience for understanding the rules, and just told us what she was doing.
