Design what doesn't matter and all that. When it comes to reward mechanics, I've seen a good justification, that if you point the reward mechanics straight at the thing you want, people might only see the reward and not the thing. So there's a justification there. But the Fruitful Void is used in all manner of situations without much justification. Most recently, I've heard it said in  the discussions on ethics that ethical choice is more powerful when it evolves naturally from play that when it's forced by the mechanics. Why is that? Does anyone have any justifications, explanations, or evidence for it?<br/><br/>Here's an example: In my latest game, everey character has a Weakness, of the moral sort. Like "Greed" or "Anger" or something. You have a pool of dice you can use (and towards the end of the game, have to use) to win conflicts. At any time, another player can give you dice and compel you to do an immoral action of some sort. You can take the dice and be a jackass, or refuse the dice, and pay as many dice out of your pool, and resist.<br/><br/>And it's very powerful. It's not evolving naturally out of the fiction at all.<br/><br/>So for the people who are all about the Fruitful Void, can you give some justification or explanation? I've heard it said more times than I can count, but it's usually just assumed to be correct. What's so great about not using the mechanics to focus on the thing you want?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228558/#Comment_228558" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T05:35:54+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  5:35AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2009 5:41AM by Graham.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find I understand the Fruitful Void if I think about Dogs In The Vineyard.<br/><br/>Dogs is, at least partly, about judging people. Now, imagine designing Dogs so that it rewarded judgement directly. Something like this: every time you judge someone, you get a free token that lets you win a future conflict.<br/><br/>It'd be rubbish. You'd get players spouting judgements, but just to win the token. It wouldn't actually be fun. You wouldn't actually care <i>what</i> judgement you made. You'd just throw around judgements without thinking.<br/><br/>So, instead of rewarding judgement directly, Dogs pushes around the edges. It rewards things like escalating, which has a moral impact. It creates situations to provoke a judgement, rather than rewarding the players when they judge people.<br/><br/>You can make similar arguments with The Shab Al-Hiri Roach (which doesn't give you an extra die when you abuse your power) or My Life With Master (which doesn't have a Monster Die that you gain when you act like a monster).<br/><br/>With all these conversations on ethics and concepts, there's a temptation to overintellectualise. But, if you bring it down to the level of individual games, I find it simpler. With the Fruitful Void, it's just more interesting to provoke the thing you want indirectly.<br/><br/>I like your Weakness mechanic. Even then, though, you're not rewarding people directly when they show their weakness: as, for example, you would be if you just got an extra die when you used your weakness. You're doing something subtler, getting players to tempt each other with dice. It's more interesting.<br/><br/>There you go. That's my understanding of the Fruitful Void. Others will differ.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>P.S.

I've heard it formulated as "Don't make rules about the important things you want in your game, make the rules so that the important thing arises by itself."

Elizabeth is writing a game based on Burn Notice, a TV show about spies lying low in the suburbs why they try to figure out what went wrong on their last mission, and we were talking about how to do that.<br/><br/>She was saying that the spy life encourages the characters to treat everyone as resources to be used, people you can get favors from.  But one of the themes of the show is that, eventually, human connections develop and you end up risking your life to save some local kid from the mob, just because it's the right thing to do.  However, there's still this pressure, based on your training, to think of associates in terms of what they can do for you and what you owe them.<br/><br/>So I said: "You could probably get away with just building a favor economy for your game, where you trade favors around to various people. And over time, you have the GM present situations to the players that, according to the favor economy, <i>they should not get involved in because it's not worth it, mechanically.</i>  But as GM, you try to make the situations morally and personally captivating, such that players reject the purely mechanical cost-benefit analysis and <i>do what's right</i>."<br/><br/>In that case, the Fruitful Void is rejecting the mechanical incentives and putting your character at a disadvantage.  You're not designing for that.  In fact, you're creating mechanical incentives that push away from that.  But, still, that's what gives the game emotional power -- the fact that you're overcoming mechanical incentives and making a choice despite the costs makes that choice more meaningful.<br/><br/>There are lots of ways to use the Fruitful Void and I think Chris is right that's it's basically about leaving room for player choice / input on key decisions instead of mechanically guiding them to certain behaviors or outcomes.  Sure, it's not critical for every game, necessarily.  But it is a powerful technique that's important to have in your design arsenal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228590/#Comment_228590" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T11:17:35+00:00" title="August 29, 2009 11:17AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon probably already did read it, but for the people who are guessing what "void" we are talking about, this is a link to <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=119" rel="nofollow">the article who created the expression</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228592/#Comment_228592" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T11:26:06+00:00" title="August 29, 2009 11:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I always just thought it was a particularly sterile metaphor for the uterus.</p>\n<p>You know, the uterus of moral puzzles.

It's a family drama, mostly.  And my character's issue was Grief.  Yesterday was my spotlight episode, and we tried to figure out how to best address her issue.  It was very important to me that the way she ultimately deals with her grief would not be determined by the conflict resolution system.  It had to come out of the fiction and out of the character, as I envisioned and played her.  Sure, that fiction is structured to a good degree by the rules (including to some degree the conflict resolution system), but that point where she's in a situation and works through her grief?  That couldn't be a conflict.  If I had set up a "roll to overcome my grief" conflict, it would have been... much less meaningful.  As it turned out, she was faced with a tense situation and realized that even though her grief for her dead sister almost made her give up on life, she still cared enough about those loved ones who were still around to snap out of it (and try to save them).<br/><br/>So, not reward system related, but resolution related, in this case.  The choice had to be mine/hers.  The results of that choice, though, we left to the resolution system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229113/#Comment_229113" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T19:22:48+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  7:22PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always figured 'Fruitful Void' = 'Show Don't Tell'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229118/#Comment_229118" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T20:38:42+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  8:38PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Imagine if, rather than mechanics for swinging swords and casting magic, D&amp;D had rolls for, like, "kill the monster" or "acquire loot."

The Fruitful Void is the, uh, let's say "<i>global</i> sum" of all the parts of an RPG. The Void simply doesn't exist on the level of a scenario, it's bigger than that.<br/><br/>The Void certainly isn't something you "use"... and I'm tempted to say it's not even something you "do"... It's just kinda something that <i>is</i>.<br/><br/>In some ways I find the concept of the Fruitful Void to be much simpler than people want to make it, and in others ways more complex. On the one hand, it's simply the creative space allotted for players to make decisions. I think that's pretty much it (though you can argue that the concept implies a couple other ideas). But deducing a game's Void can be complicated, because you have to have a solid understanding of how *all* the little pieces of a game fit together and influence one another.<br/><br/>I'll also say this---the Void isn't necessarily tied to Creative Agenda, but there is a relationship between the two (at least in well-designed games). That is to say, in a thematic (-facilitating) game, there will most likely be some sort of moral/thematic issue at the center. In a Gamist (-facilitating) game, the Void will be filled with some sort of tactical concern. In a Sim (-facilitating) game the Void will be filled with, err... whateverthehell you want to say Sim-play is about. So a couple examples:<br/><br/>As has been said, Dogs isn't about judgment, it's about morality, right? Actually, I would define it a bit further and say it's about creating or discovering your own sense of morality, particularly as it contrasts with the other Dogs. Whenever you make a judgment, you're making a statement about what is and isn't moral. <i>There's a prostitute in town, shoot her (or him) in the face, that's obviously wrong</i>. What the GM is then supposed to do is press that issue from slightly different angles, to further define your judgment/morality. <i>Is prostitution wrong if the people *love* each other? What if they only *like* each other? Is the prostitute wrong if they're forced into it by some sort of pimp? What if the prostitute is "forced" by economic circumstances? etc.</i> But what happens over time is you'll reach a point where your judgments won't match the judgments of the other Dogs, and the ramifications of that will break up the party. That's also a statement of personal morality, because you're saying what personal ethics you're willing to bend (for the cohesion of the group) and which ones you aren't.<br/><br/>Now, DnD (3.x, I'm not familiar with 4.0): I have to disagree with Paul and say the Void is not about "<i>how swinging swords and casting magic create the context in which we can all agree that a fictional dragon was killed, or how the members of a spelunking party grabbed some expensive stuff out of a deep hole</i>". By-the-book DnD is about, uh, "how do I (or we as group) become the best combative (group) possible?" There's two aspects to this. First there's all the character building stuff, which includes leveling up and item collection. This is about the strategy of building an effective and versatile character. But second there's the actual tactical application of that character in combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229745/#Comment_229745" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T00:46:18+00:00" title="September  3, 2009 12:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, I do realize what the fruitful void is.

(Works of art or literature.)<br/><br/>An Open Work is one which (implicitly or explicitly) asks the reader to interpret it in his own way, and gives him affordances to encouage him to do so.<br/><br/>A Closed Work is one which assumes a single interpretation.  It's "baked in" to the work.<br/><br/>The irony is that Closed Works, which assume a single interpretation, are susceptible to complete subversion if you come in there with interpretative devices that they did not foresee.  If you come to a golden-age Superman comic or an early James Bond novel with Marxist assumptions, or, less academically, with the assumptions of someone from a third-world nation which recently achieved independence from colonialism... the brittle built-in interpretation snaps and the work becomes something totally different.  Everything will take on a different meaning without the built-in structure of assumptions supporting it.<br/><br/>But an Open Work is not brittle.  If you come to a Shakespeare play or a James Joyce novel with Marxist or post-Colonial assumptions, you will be able to make an unusual interpretation out of the work, but you won't *compromise* it in the same way, because it doesn't depend on a simplistic and univocal set of cultural assumptions to function.<br/><br/>I thought of this distinction, thinking about "showing and not telling" as Droog says.  The thing with showing and not telling is that people might not read what you show the same way you intended it.   You can tell somebody "this kid is a brat."  Or you can show somebody the child mouthing off to his mom.  The person might read that situation as a child standing up for his own needs in the face of crushing parental authority.  You can't be sure when you show, not tell, that what you're showing is going to tell what you would have told.<br/><br/>You can become more sure by making what you "show" an open rather than closed work -- that is, by recognizing that people can come to it with different assumptions and so foreseeing complexity and ambiguity in interpretation from the very start.<br/><br/>POWERKILL by John Tynes (<a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_powerkill.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_powerkill.html</a>) is a classic example of Eco's deviant interpretation of closed works, applied to roleplaying games.<br/><br/>POWERKILL doesn't work on Dogs in the Vineyard, because Dogs doesn't have a bunch of baked in brittle assumptions about reality for it to question.   Questioning all the things it questions is *totally legit* in Dogs, not a violation of the assumptions of the game.  Dogs isn't brittle like that.  Because it's an Open Work.<br/><br/>So... The Fruitful Void has something to do with the concept of the Open Work, in that they are both about having an open space where interpretative activity happens, which is foreseen by the surrounding work, driven by it, provoked by it, but not programmed by it; both demand that somebody bring into the void place what they brought with them, and foresee different things possibly being brought in by different people.<br/><br/>These things appear in my head and I gots to write them down, that is all.  I hope they are interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229804/#Comment_229804" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T08:35:05+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  8:35AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2009 8:35AM by Eric.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: edheil</cite>POWERKILL by John Tynes (<a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_powerkill.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_powerkill.html</a>) is a classic example of Eco's deviant interpretation of closed works, applied to roleplaying games.</blockquote>\nThat's good stuff right there.
