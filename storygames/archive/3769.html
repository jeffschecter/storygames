I often know the person who wrote it, at least vaguely, so I don't want to offend them<br/>2. If I don't like the game, I haven't played it, so it's unfair to pass comments<br/><br/>So here's a half-arsed solution. I'm going to retitle some games, then talk about them, and see if it's any use.<br/><br/><b>Hermione</b><br/><br/>This is the game that persuaded me to be <i>very careful</i> before spending money on indie games. It's not a well-known game, but it's one you can buy at IPR. I think it was at the Forge booth last year.<br/><br/>I first played <i>Hermione</i> last year. The game went OK: not <i>superb</i>, but OK. Later, at a convention, I felt the urge to buy something and, partly out of curiosity, bought <i>Hermione</i>. <br/><br/>It's a glossy, beautiful book. And there's a good game somewhere in there.<br/><br/>Problem is, it's barely more than a conflict resolution mechanic. It turns out all the setting and character stuff that got me enthused was added in by the person who ran the game. The game itself is an interesting project that needs a year or two's playtesting: at the moment, it's half-baked.<br/><br/>The writing is lazy. Really, the author should have known better: it's like a blog post. <br/><br/>Overall, it's not worth the cover price: bad writing; an average game that needed work before publishing.<br/><br/><b>Father Time</b><br/><br/>This one's a pretty well-known game, one I've seen mentioned a lot. It's not one of <i>the big games</i> that <i>everyone plays</i>, but it's a respected Forge game.<br/><br/>I've heard the game's great. Problem is, I can't read the text. It's so densely written I can hardly get a sense of the rules. It's...just...painful to read.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I've thought of running this. But then I try to read the text and...it's too much effort. Can't do it. Play something else instead.<br/><br/><b>Pursued by a bear</b><br/><br/>So here's an odd one. This game's great. It looks great. It plays well. I've played it a couple of times. You've seen this game mentioned quite a bit on forums.<br/><br/>The tragedy of this game is that, with a little more work, it could have been <i>genius</i>. As it is, it's a good, playable game, but it feels like it's been released a year too early. Some rules don't quite fit. Some things need tweaking.<br/><br/>This game could have been another <i>My Life With Master</i> or <i>Dogs In The Vineyard</i>. Indeed, it's halfway there: a good game, not quite together, released too early.<br/><br/><b>The Oracle at Delphos</b><br/><br/>Oh, man, this game is shit. Total, total shit. I cannot believe anyone charges money for this. But they do. It's on sale in my local games store.<br/><br/>So the <i>setting's</i> great. I love the setting. <br/><br/>But the author's taken a generic indie-ish resolution system, shoved it in, and hopes it works. The rules have <i>nothing</i> specifically to do with the central idea. It's all just traits and skills and shit.<br/><br/>And there's odd little rules floating about that just <i>don't make sense</i>.<br/><br/>Also, the layout is shit: courtesy of Microsoft Word. And the writing is <i>total shit</i>: puerile adolescent blog-post writing. It looks like the guy's written it once, then never looked at it again.<br/><br/>See...perhaps I'm being unfair, because I haven't played the game. But I don't want to. I can tell this game's shit. There's just nothing interesting about it. And the writing is so shit that I can't begin to read it.<br/><br/>___<br/><br/>...all right, and that's it. Obviously, that's an unrepresentative sample of what I've bought: for each four like those above, there's another four games I really like.<br/><br/>It's less use, of course, than naming names. But I hope it's vaguely interesting: at least you get a feeling of the sorts of reaction I have to various games I've bought.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84450/#Comment_84450" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T19:42:46+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  7:42PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            and yet the feedback you give during game design contests is well respected, with both praise &amp; constructive criticism<br/><br/>what is it about a game being published that makes you stop being honest/critical?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84455/#Comment_84455" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T20:03:51+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  8:03PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite><br/>So here's a half-arsed solution.

No?<br/><br/>Am I supposed to guess which games you're talking about?<br/><br/>I don't understand this.<br/><br/>Look. I know I'm not plugged into the core community. I'm not a designer, I don't hang the designers. I just like the games.<br/><br/>And I also know I am a strongly-opinionated mutherfucker, who just today told my best friend that the script he's been developing as a producer for a year is a piece of shit and he should dump the writer and move onto another project. I did it with love. I did it with more elaborate notes and words than, "piece of shit," but that's what I said.  (Three other writers he gave the script to said the same thing.)<br/><br/>I mean, why not call someone out and say, "Dude! Genius! <i>Right around the next bend!</i>"<br/><br/>I don't get this. I don't get any of this at all.<br/><br/>When I've done horrible work, I've known it, and the world didn't shy from telling me. You're obviously quite passionate about all this stuff. More importantly, someone who disagrees with you might be able to point out two or three things that makes you go, "Ah!"

Graham, while I respect the emotions that gave impetus to this experiment, I think its safe to say that it is a failed experiment. Witholding names to protect everyone's feelings leads to reviews that aren't useful and aren't really interesting. It helps me not at all to vaguely know that there is a game out there in indieland that you bought and didn't like.<br/><br/>I only see two ways you can viablly review games. You can give only positive reviews, which means reviewing games you have played and liked, games you have read and liked but not played, or the parts you like in games which also have negative features. Second, you can give positive and negative feedback, doing your best to be both frank and sensitive to the feelings of the designers. The only other way to do it (I guess there's a third way) is to just speak in the abstract, be vague about "the types of games you like" or "games that have scene framing" and not name actual games at all.<br/><br/>While I love the first type of review, I think there is a lot of that out there in podcast land. I would appreciate hearing more about things that didn't work or weren't quite baked. Of course, I'm not saying just "let her rip!" and trash games. But, I thoughtful discussion, one which points out the positive stuff as well and stuff that other people might like even if you don't, would be well received.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84472/#Comment_84472" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T22:55:51+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 10:55PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the problem with naming names is that we fear it might have a disastrous effect on game sales. Say I don't like Beast Hunters (I do like Beast Hunters). I don't like it's structure and I don't think it produces the effects that it says it does. But I'm a smart guy, and I recognize that this is just my opinion. It may well be that other people will play and enjoy the game and get things out of it that I didn't. hell, I've seen people play and enjoy it. So I don't like the game and I think it sucks, but I'm not convinced that other people will feel the same way. So it's just my opinion, right? And I'm certainly entitled to that. And I'm certainly entitled to share the opinion, and maybe it will even help Christian out. Feedback is good, after all. But then I remember that  know and like Christian, and I know that this community is pretty small and that opinion travels fast. I think maybe putting a post here or on my blog saying "beast Hunters sucks, here's why" might actually really hurt his sales. I don't want that to happen, so I don't do it.<br/><br/>This community (and other connected ones) are built largely around the concept of support and good will. The downside of this is that speaking negatively about a published game (especially one published by someone we all know) is still pretty taboo, even with the New Honesty. And we all know that word of mouth will make or break a game.<br/><br/>I think that if you really have a problem with a game (to the point where you feel like you need to warn people against buying it) then you shouldn't feel too bad about publicly saying so. If you are worried about hurting someones feeling, just send them a private email and share your thoughts.<br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84476/#Comment_84476" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T23:37:22+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 11:37PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say, after listening to tons of bravado over the years from the Indie RPG crew, this thread has depressed the fucking hell out of me.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84478/#Comment_84478" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T23:40:40+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 11:40PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not done yet.<br/><br/>For fuck's sake. <br/><br/>It's taboo to name in public when a product isn't working?<br/><br/>For fuck's sake.

I'm not saying it should be, but it certainly looks like it is. For some of us anyway. As I said before, I think a lot of it comes from not wanting to hurt feelings, and a lot of it comes from not wanting to sabotage a games potential success within this community. I think there's also a strong sense that anything that should be said should be said during playtest and peer review, before the game in question is released. With more and more games appearing every month this just isn't really possible anymore. At least not in the same way that it was 3 years ago. I think with the ashcans and waiting periods we're see a recognition of this overall problem and positive steps to solve it.<br/><br/>I think the thing to remember here is that it's fine to be constructive, and it's fine to be critical. No one wants to be rude though. And I think that for a lot of us there's a fear that constructive and critical will come off as rude. This is a fear we should get over. I know that some of us don't even have a problem with this.<br/><br/>There's also a glass house issue. I'm terrified to point a finger for fear that some one else will turn around and say "you can't really talk. You made Panty Explosion after all". I have a really fragile ego.<br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84480/#Comment_84480" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T00:02:12+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 12:02AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2007 12:02AM by John_Harper.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And now Chris is foaming at the mouth!

There are people who think the point of playing the cards in <i>Primetime Adventures</i> is to get a chance to shine and do something cool. Only when people pipe up about this stuff can a conversation take place and new points of view be examined.<br/><br/>So, maybe you don't like a game for some reason and it's a dumb reason.

I'm just saying that I think the idea that we might be ruining someones chances at success might (for some of us) hold us back from voicing how we really feel about some games. It shouldn't, but it does. I think that in a small and young community like ours this is pretty understandable. Or at least not surprising. As the community continues to grow and mature I think this will become less and less of an issue.

Constructive criticism is one of the things (not the only thing) that make these forums really sing.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite><br/>PS. This is actually a thinly-veiled slap to everyone who attacked Graham in this thread.</blockquote>\nI certainly hope Graham did not feel my comment was attacking him in some way. My intention was to dissagree, not attack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84509/#Comment_84509" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T03:45:50+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  3:45AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can be critical without being mean or rude, but yes being critical may cause hurt feelings.<br/><br/>When I first started posting at StoryGames with any frequency Andy appeared to tell me to name names and get everything out in the open.  I did that even though I was strongly disinclined to do so, and I've continued to do so.  If you value quality in small press games you need to do this, otherwise the happy group promotion of all things indie and story games attitude around here will continue to encourage folk to produce games that just aren't as good as they could be.<br/><br/>I think your concerns revolve around rejection by your friends and the community and a concern that criticizing a game you haven't played is unfair.  On the first account, I can't think of anything the community needs more than polite criticism.  It may be that an author decides they no longer care for you due to that criticism, but all social groups come with the risk of dislike on the part of one of the members.  Ultimately that's their problem for being unable to deal with criticism of their work from friends and fans, not yours for doing the best job you can.  As to criticizing a game you haven't played, just say that's the case.  This is how interesting and useful conversations get started, and if you're way off base someone will drop by the thread to let you know.<br/><br/>So, please, name names.  I want to see you continue your excellent, critical reviews of these games, but doing so requires you to let me know what you're talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84514/#Comment_84514" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T04:05:08+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  4:05AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, name names.

And my egotism.  It is interesting to see the things that are problematic for you. <br/><br/>Here's a suggestion - if you aren't comfortable with bald-faced criticism, which might be interpreted as rude, inflammatory, ill-informed, unprofessional, whatever, criticize through actual play reports.  Play the games and talk about them.  Your experience in actual play is valid, and if it is negative, that's still valuable feedback to the designer and potential buyers.  That is, unfailingly, what I do, and I'm very comfortable with it.  It almost always serves as entree to a discussion, either in public or private, with the designer as well.  I think the only problem with my approach is that I'm selective in what I play, so I'm talking about games that I fully anticipated would be amazing.  This leaves a conspicuous silence about games I'm not interested in, or don't think would be fun to play for whatever reason.  <br/><br/>I'm just offering this as a counterpoint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84520/#Comment_84520" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T05:19:25+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  5:19AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Silences aren't all that conspicuous.

Mortal Coil had the benefit of being a known factor (produced by a guy that everyone likes, even), and Ron called it out in a way that was not negative and brought attention to the game. If someone else that no one knew put out a game that no one had ever heard of and someone that is influential in the community vocally stated that the game sucked, was flawed, broken or unfinished... well, who knows what could happen? Again, I'm not saying we shouldn't criticize games, and I'm not saying we shouldn't do it publicly. But I do think that  many (if not most) of the people that make up this community have some issues with being anything less then supportive. I think there are a lot of different reasons for this, and I think that for some people it does come down to not wanting to potentially hurt a books chance at success just because they didn't like it.<br/><br/>Believe me though, I know that negative word of mouth can really boost interest and sales.

And if my game was truly horrible (and that's not what Graham said <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>, I really would rather have horrible sales and be pushed to make it better or pull it off the market.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84569/#Comment_84569" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T08:11:37+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  8:11AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>We could all just agree to make nice nice.

If it's sarcasm, I missed the tone, and the rest of this post will be moot.<br/><br/>There are bad games. If my game-in-progress were published today, it'd be a bad game. It'd get people all excited to play, then leave them stranded in an island of confusion with no compass. People would buy it and be let down. That's why I haven't published it yet. <br/><br/>Sometimes games get published before those kinds of problems get worked out. Sometimes the designers know there are problems and sometimes they don't. These are bad games. I'm not saying they can't be rescued, but you shouldn't give them your $15. <br/><br/>We should not support one another unconditionally. We should reward excellence, criticize failure, and pressure mediocrity.<br/><br/>If someone criticizes a game that people generally feel is excellent, I'm sure someone will speak up in its defense. That's a good thing. If someone praises a game that is a real stinker, I hope someone will stand up and call it what it is. Our games are not going to get better if we all make "nice nice." <br/><br/>So let's break out some tact, mix well with honesty, and make better games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

But here's the thing -- the "I can take it" thing happens only when there is already a solid body of positive comments about the game already being made.<br/><br/>Case in point:  The most recent <i>Gamma World</i> comes out, and pretty much gets nothing but bad reviews.  Sales tank.  People are talking about it, but very little good is being said, and the bandwagon rolls on and rolls <i>over</i> the product, crushing it.<br/><br/>This can also happen when simply nothing is being said, and then you shout into the silence that the game is "bad".  One voice, lots of silence = the only opinion.  <br/><br/>IME, it's only when a game has a mixture of praise and success going that the bad things don't hurt sales.  In those cases, the bad things said kick the game's fans into action.  Without fans, without established positive momentum -- without defenders, really -- those bad said things <i>can</i> be bad for the game.<br/><br/>YMMV.<br/><br/>Frex, I feel perfectly fine talking about how PTA doesn't work for me -- it has an established basis of success.  But I'm not about to beat on a published game (unless the author is specifically asking me for it) if the sales/success for it has been minimal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>New honesty for cowards - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="New honesty for cowards - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Here's another key difference, Fred.

Who are these folks that Jake is saying are being poltroons? Yeah, sure, Story-Games seems to tone people down with the part of the community that's always like, "This is a casual place, so don't attack peoples' ideas" (and we've seen how well I've adhered to that). But I think that most of the people I think of when folks say the "indie community" are pretty tough critics. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean even before Jared came on, we knew about him. And Ron? Man, he's the toughest critic around. To echo seriously Jared's comment about PTA, you can read my public playtest comments about PTA, which were pretty uncomplimentary - an opinion that I haven't changed to date even with some rules changes. I've actually shouted down some bad games into oblivion, just so that they wouldn't get published, becasue my opinion of them was so low. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've gotten some ferocious, and probably deserved critique of Universalis. Tony and I have fought like dogs over some of the differences between Universalis and Capes, for instance (very briefly, he feels that Universalis needlessly overcontrols some social aspects, and I think that Capes should have mechanical control methods of this sort). I've written pages of criticisms in rules editing mode for games like Shadows in the Fog, or, I may proudly state, for late editions of Burning Empire. <br/>\n<br/>\nLuke can verify that I was not nice with some of my commentary to him about the pre-production rules. He hasn't changed all of that, either, so I still have some sharp criticisms of the game (though, overall, it's pretty damn good). <br/>\n<br/>\nI've criticized many of the short-form RPGs that come out of Game Chef, out of a feeling of self-recrimination for having been somewhat the cause of them (the format promotes writing them). My opinion on the subject of whether or not certain games have sold at the Forge Booth or not is that I think that they should sink or swim on their own merits in Darwinian fashion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, a general recrimination gets leveled, but no names get named. Well, it ain't me, nor is it anyone I respect, who is doing what folks are saying is being done. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, except for Graham. Which I just can't fathom. Graham, I want for Universalis to be one of the games on that list. I want you to tell me that it sucks terribly. Why? Not because I relish hearing that. But because your integrity as a reviewer matters to me more than one person saying something bad about a game I've written.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, some people aren't going to like my games. In fact, you'd hardly be the first person to say that Universalis blows chunks. You wouldn't even be in the first hundred, likely. So, to some extent, too... get over yourself. Frankly you can't cause as much damage as you seem to think you can. Go ahead, do your worst. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut mostly just be honest.

If you've read my posts of late, you'll note that one of the reasons I'd love more people talking about what they don't like in a game is that I often see that people have mis-read or misunderstood certain rules that are producing no-fun. So, clearly, I often the believe the customer is often wrong.<br/><br/>I've learned over the years that some people will never be able to articulate why they didn't like something. I'm certainly not going to try to brow-beat it out of them. If they want to post criticism, they can post. And I can certainly ask for more details. But they minute someone who <i>can'</i>t articulate why a game isn't working feels that they're on the defensive, it's now about "sides" and we get that horrible, "Well, I'm sure the game works great for some people, but for me these three things clearly don't work," or whatever.  I mean, that makes no sense.  How can three (or however many) things NOT WORK AT ALL and the game still work for so many people?<br/><br/>But when people put their back up against the wall, they fight rather than talk.<br/><br/>My post was to encourage discussion of specifics -- which is a moving toward understand through shared details -- and not to frame the matter as the person offering critique as an "attacker" who now must "defend" against counter-attacks.<br/><br/>So, again, no.  Not at all.  The reading you brought to my post was completely at odds with my point.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86286/#Comment_86286" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T15:39:41+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  3:39PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Why does one have to be an asshole to be real?

In your post, you reassured eruditus no less than three times in a single paragraph that there was no need to defend, explain or otherwise elaborate on <i>what</i> and <i>why</i> in particular he wasn't fond of Donjon and Sorcerer's dicing system. I was afraid that the language I saw was indicative of some mindset that one should have a <i>carte blanche</i> to spout garbage at the top of one's lungs (not to say eruditus' post did) without any sort of justification or repercussion. You know, what we call "customer service", i.e. do a disservice to our reasonable customers by pandering to the unreasonable ones. It appears I was wrong, which makes me happy.<br/><br/>In my opinion, healthy critiquing must be a two-way street, and I have elsewhere defended my opinion that while all honest critique is important, if it's not well thought through it's near useless in this market. Other markets can use unfounded complaints <i>en masse</i> in data mining, to figure out trends in a market. For as much as I'd like to, I can't data mine Story Games or the Forge for any useful information. The statistical <i>n</i> is simply too low to reveal anything but anecdotal evidence, which isn't useful unless it's well explained and reflected upon.<br/><br/>I might also have reacted badly due to the fact that the game I'm working on at the moment use a basic dicing system ripped wholesale from Donjon/Sorcerer. With a single opposed roll / deal of cards (as in my case), I can determine the workings of any number of factors, determine degree of success, have a seamless system for chained rolls, and in addition control the degree of randomness (which seems to be what eruditus is complaining about) by varying the die size / cards available in the deck. It's not perfect, and can produce some odd effects, which is why in both games dice rolling will result in coolness regardless of success. These are all - in my mind - valid critique of his critique and warrants a response. I'm sure he <b>has</b> thought it through, mind, but his critique of the two aforementioned games will be near useless to a newcomer who hasn't played either game without an elaboration of his point.<br/><br/>This is why I prefer a model of "help me understand X" rather than "I don't like game X", even if you aren't willing to "understand" game X and will never play it again. The former invites responses from those who do enjoy the game, while the latter often just sounds like a personal gripe-fest, could easily be the result of a bad play group or lack of coffee, is unhelpful to outsiders, and kills communication dead or worse, brings it into hostile territory as the brigade of fanbois come over the hill to rescue their game.<br/><br/>Anyway, Christopher, sorry for the harsh reaction. Sounds like we're on the same page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86382/#Comment_86382" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T22:26:42+00:00" title="August  7, 2007 10:26PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2007 10:32PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We are. <br/><br/>I'll just add that one can't demand justification, and I have no idea what the "repercussion" to do so might be.<br/><br/>One can ask.

The game in particular that I was recalling having beaten to death was called Mageblade. It was a fantasy heartbreaker whose designer simply could neither decide what his game was about, nor had any idea how to write a rule to support anything that he did decide upon. Worse, even when he did have an idea, he could not write it down in a way that was interpretable to the reader. I didn't "hate" the game - the game was objectively unplayable, and publishing it would have been a travesty. Given that it had been worked on by myself and many other people who honestly tried to get the designer on the right track with a lot of effort, it being published with any association with The Forge would have done severe damage to the credibility of the community as a place that tends to produce good designs. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to see what the interactions regarding that game were, I'm sure you can search them up on The Forge. I don't think you'll see malice, but, again, solid critique about where the designer was going with his game (and not just from myself). Given it's lack of quality, I think that you'll see why it was that the game never got published. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86491/#Comment_86491" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T09:09:30+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  9:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, let's just say that particular line was "inspired" by your post, like the "Constantine" movie was inspired by the "Hellblazer" comic. That is, a very tenuous relationship.<br/><br/>I was really just trying to give the two extremes of critique - the helpful spurs along the way to publishing, and the unbridled vitriol. Not implying you'd be on either end of those extremes.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at is that it's not the reason <i>why</i> you critique that's important. You felt Mageblade needed considerable work and direction, and tried to do your part to elevate it. Someone else might've hated the whole concept with a passion, and is equally justified in critiquing. It's <i>how</i> the critique is presented that is important, IMHO. Even unbridled vitriol - maybe even especially unbridled vitriol - can be useful information, both for the designer and the general public, if elaborated on properly.<br/><br/>Christopher, I will agree to disagree with you on that. Much like the designer invited critique by publishing a game into an open market, the critic invited himself into having to present ample justification for his opinion by posting on a public forum. While "repercussions" may sound harsh, it's really just cause and effect. If you present an unfounded opinion and aren't prepared to justify it, the repercussion should be that nobody pays much attention to your opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86524/#Comment_86524" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T10:05:49+00:00" title="August  8, 2007 10:05AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>People... as in more than one?

I gues what I'm saying is that for me to criticize a dgame there has to be something about it that I really think is broken/flawed or makes it unplayable. Otherwise all I'm doing is reviewing and saying whether I like a game. I don't think there's anything wrong with reviewing, but it's not very valuable (in the way criticism is, anyway). So for me, I'm either going to love something and review it, or I'm going to find it seriously flwed/unplayable and criticize it. If it falls inbetween, I'm really not going to bother. <br/><br/>This is of course a seperate thing from not voicing criicism for fear of offending someone.I think that's mostly an unconscous thing, where this is more deliberate. <br/><br/>Sorry, I keep talking about my personal opinions on this.

People are watching the public fora. Anything said in public around the indie dialog will be noted. If you want to be a designer and get a seat at the table, I think there might be (unfounded?) concern that public criticism could damage that (it's been noted there is social currency in being one of the well respected game designers).<br/>2. If IPR's some-are-more-equal-than-others slogan is an indication, heavy-duty criticism could be seen as anti-community even if the commentor has no aspirations to join the design club.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87875/#Comment_87875" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-13T15:07:00+00:00" title="August 13, 2007  3:07PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2007 3:07PM by nemomeme.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thread.  I design and think a lot about games but haven't published anything yet.<br/><br/>I come down 100% on the side of honesty, but that can mean a lot of different things.  There's honesty within a community of designers and players with constructive intent and consequence.  There's also just people stating preferences.  There's a lot of honest commentary that isn't particularly useful, whether damning or praising.  I really like and play less than half the games I've bought.  But I can find effusive gushing on rpgnet or other places about just about any game I can name.  Buyer beware and all that.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of a half dozen threads here that try to discuss the roles of different fora.  Whether between Story Games and the Forge, or other.  Honesty is meaningless apart from context.  No one wants to hurt anyone's feelings.  Most designers want useful criticism which they can apply to hone their craft.  And different people have different thresholds for critique.  If a designer claims to value it, give it to them with both guns.  Doing it publicly or whether Story Games is the province for it are separate issues.<br/><br/>I recognized Father Time immediately.  I have a pretty good guess about Hermione.  The other two could be any number of games, fortunately and unfortunately.<br/><br/>Here's the thing about honest and thorough criticism (the only kind I find of much use): I can find good things to say about just about any game, and there are things I would really like to change about my absolute favorites.  Scope, context, and intent I think are the concern of those who seem to be in favor of something less than complete and public "honesty."  Well, that and sales, apparently.  Too much criticism is one-sided and more about advocacy.<br/><br/>While I agree generally with Graham's comments about Universalis, I'm really glad it was written and glad I bought it.  It's not an easy read, but it's influenced my play and design tremendously.  Having bought most of what IPR has to offer, I can see its influence on a dozen other games, all to the better.  Honesty about its perceived flaws in some contexts is not helpful, either to players and designers that might benefit from it.  Honesty directly to it's author is possibly helpful, depending on how well it's provided.  And then there's just being a bastard.  (not saying at all that's Graham's purpose)<br/><br/>Honesty should be well-rounded.  I think Contenders needs a lot of work.  I said so on my blog.  Its author responded to my criticism and similar criticisms of others, has provided some nice hacks, and I look forward to a second edition.  I also indicated truthfully that it helped provide one of the best times I've had role-playing in the last couple years.<br/><br/>I tend to try to err on the positive side of criticism on the internet whether I know the designer or not.  One is handicapped by the medium with regard for expressing intent or in permitting immediate emotive feedback.<br/><br/>Rambling now.  Bottom line: analyze motives for criticism.  If you have regard for others' feelings, ask your target whether they'd like public or private criticism.  Either kind can potentially be valuable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87914/#Comment_87914" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-13T17:00:13+00:00" title="August 13, 2007  5:00PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Oy.

Mike, you've obviously gotten more cantankerous in your dotage. During all of our discussions about Mage Blade (which I occasionally go back and reference) I never really got that you thought it was... lemme re-read to make sure I get it right.. "objectively unplayable, and publishing it would have been a travesty" and "it being published with any association with The Forge would have done severe damage to the credibility of the community as a place that tends to produce good designs". It's a pity too, because I would prefer to have gotten that in our discussions directly, either then or since. <br/>\n<br/>\nMage Blade isn't dead. If that was your intention, you've failed. What you did do, and what any harsh criticism should do, is make me realize my mistakes, and slow me down to the point where I could work on them. At one point, when I brought Mage Blade to the Forge, I thought it was close to completion, and simply needed polishing. Now the game has changed a bit, and while you may never touch it again, I still appreciate the honest efforts you put into it, and into me as a designer. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow back onto the topic at hand.. I think my opinion is fairly clear. Honesty, even harsh honesty, is necessary. Sure, it's harder to do to a friend once the game is a product, but it's still very necessary. My biggest issue, though not with the SG community, as I've only recently joined and have no real idea as to it's mode of operation, has been in trying to get that honest criticism during the design stages (outside of Mike's early efforts, and Lxndr's continuing willingness to discuss my ideas) of any or all of my games. But I suppose that's it's own topic entirely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3769%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3769%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>New honesty for cowards - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="New honesty for cowards - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Hi Lance!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Well perhaps I'm overstating things a bit.

But, well, you're making my point for me anyhow. The point is that you were going to publish, it would have been a bad idea to do so, we gave you criticism, and you held off. So, goal accomplished. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm saying is that you don't think that I was taking it easy on you somehow, do you? As is being accused here? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you now have a better version of the game, then great! Again goal accomplished. It's not that Mage Blade could never be playable, or should never be played, just that it should be the best game it can before you attempt publishing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nPretty simple. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, SG really is not the site for hard-core criticism. For that there's still the Forge, or Knife Fight, or Gamecraft, or any number of sites. This particular local community is supposed to be more laid back. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut SG is not the equivalent of the indie community, either. Lots of us are here, but were' elswhere as well. Andy developed this place specifically to be more chatty and sociable. If you want the hard-core stuff, go to a hard-core site. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88113/#Comment_88113" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T20:06:46+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  8:06PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mike!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have twice now tried to reply, and twice failed. Rather than take this as a sign that I shouldn't post, I will instead take it as a sign that I needed to think over this and be clear on what I was trying to say; IOW, not post when I have to run off to work, or to birthing class with my wife. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I'll briefly address you personally, Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't really know if back on the Forge you were taking it easy. I can't imagine why you should; None of the reasons given here to take it easy on a published game so you don't "mug your friends for money" as someone picturesquely put it applied in our situation. I wasn't published, and I had an unfocused product, and little ability to express what I wanted to express. Maybe, as I said before, you've just grown more cantankerous and blunt since then. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I won't pretend I wasn't just a little bit hurt to read your previous post. Not so much for the sentiments expressed therein, but because I came across them pretty much by chance, rather than directed to me. On the other hand, the overwhelming response was oddly positive. I dashed off my last post, and ran off to work. On my way in, I put on some energetic music, and somehow found myself in a better mood than I've been in for quite some time. Two realizations came to me. I realized that I viewed your opinions as a challenge. My response wasn't "Mike was SOOO mean!", it was "Oh yeah?" I've been working on the game in my glacially slow fashion, and I think it's got some good promise. It's still got a few systems that I need to redo before I'm ready to put it back out there, but once I do, I fully expect that there will be those who still hate it, and think it's broken. While I can't promise I won't get defensive (I certainly did during our Forge conversations...) I can promise that I will listen and consider every point made. Before I publish, Mage Blade will be a product that *I* enjoy playing, and that I am proud of. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my first realization; Criticism, even harsh criticism, from a respected source shouldn't be a crushing blow to your ego. It should be a challenge. You should look at what's said, look at your game, and ask yourself as honestly as possible if the criticism has merit, and if so, how it should be fixed. While I can see some merit to not publicly thrashing a game put forth by a friend of yours that you think has promise, especially when that game hasn't garnered enough of a fan-base to weather some bad press, that doesn't mean you should keep your criticisms to yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy second realization stems from my first; Silence is so much more deadly and disheartening than even harsh criticism. Believe me, it's soul-crushing to put something out there, hoping for good feedback (because that means that your game doesn't suck) and eager even for bad (because that means that people care enough to tell you what needs improvement) and to instead get... Nothing. I haven't published yet, because I'm a neanderthal and do all of my design on cave walls, but I imagine that it would actually be worse... You put out this thing that you think, you hope is ready, and maybe you'll see some sales, but when all that accompanies them is silence, well. As someone else pointed out, indie games are typically labors of love; If people were just in it for the money, they'd do D20 supplements, or better yet, keep their noses out of RPG design. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo Graham, you seem to be a respected reviewer. My guess is that pretty much anyone would be honored to have you shred their games, privately or publicly. Sure, it'd hurt.. But if they really care about the game they put out, they'll take it as a challenge, and try to make it better, somehow. How awesome would it be to get a bad review from a respected reviewer, only to turn around and have that reviewer give an honest and glowing review about another product where you learned your lessons from the first, or on the revised edition of that first, flawed product?<br/>\n<br/>\n...and that's all I got. It's a lot of words, but hopefully, I managed to get it right, this time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3769/new-honesty-for-cowards/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3769%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3769%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
