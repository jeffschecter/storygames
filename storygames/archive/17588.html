Lots of interesting approaches and solutions have been mentioned so far, and I feel like I have a number of tools as an AW MC to handle this kind of situation.<br/><br/>However, I'm surprised no one talks much about the opposite problem:<br/><br/>What if you feel the character should have a <i>better</i> chance of success? <br/><br/>What do you do then? How can you adjust the difficulty of the action?<br/><br/>I've seen two "solutions":<br/><br/>1. Make a softer move on a miss if the character is well-positioned fictionally.<br/>2. Don't ask them to roll at all; just let them "do it".<br/><br/>However, I'm not sure this necessarily does the trick. For one, the rules tell us that "when you do it, do it", which means that under many circumstances you wouldn't want to use option 2. And option 1 is not much consolation for a player character going up against serious opposition. (A very soft move isn't terribly believable for a very dangerous opponent, after all.)<br/><br/>In my very first game of Apocalypse World, I played a Brainer with -2 Hard.<br/><br/>I never went aggro on anyone in that game, because I was too scared (the odds of outright failure being in the 72% range, and the odds of full success only around 3%). I would have enjoyed some way for the MC to give me a better chance to succeed which didn't break the whole system. Instead, I found myself roleplaying my way around potential Hard-based moves, kind of like how a D&amp;D thief tries to avoid ever having to roll their thief skills.<br/><br/>I'm not sure this is optimal for the system in question.<br/><br/>Imagine that my character had a rival or an enemy: a hard-ass bad dude that he was committed to taking down. The Brainer couldn't just walk up to him and go aggro: he'd probably get killed. If he wanted to take him down, he'd have to set up a situation which allowed him for an automatic kill. However, if something went wrong and he didn't manage to get the drop on the "bad dude", I would still want his preparation or leverage (fictional positioning) to matter.<br/><br/>Let'say the Brainer got the dude cornered in a room and opened fire on him with an automatic weapon (go aggro). Would he really still only have that 3% or so chance to hit and kill him?<br/><br/>How do you handle this in your games? Do you have an intermediate solution between option 1 and option 2?<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398666/#Comment_398666" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T16:17:23+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  4:17PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2012 4:18PM by C_Edwards.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm wondering why, as a Brainer with a -2 Hard, you're trying direct conflict that uses +Hard. If you want to be direct w/o using Hard, there's always Direct Brain Whisper Projection which lets you use +Weird for Go Aggro effects. Like, if you wanted to go around shooting badasses, why did you take a -2 Hard, ya know? The limitations and abilities of our characters guide how we play them.<br/><br/>All that aside though, I think that I'd just go with something like the simple directive from Ghost/Echo. If the character is especially well-prepared or otherwise has an obvious advantage in the situation, take +1. Which, considering that stats only go to +3, is a pretty big deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398667/#Comment_398667" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T16:19:30+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  4:19PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2012 4:20PM by creases.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems to me to be a complicated question with many aspects that smarter people than me will do a better job answering. At first pass, I notice two things.<br/><br/>First, the consequences of failure should generally be interesting enough that you're still tempted to do things that might fail. This is on the GM, and it's part of making the world interesting and being a fan of the PCs. The thing about failed rolls in AW is that they are opportunities to push the plot along. Some of the best action scenes in the movies could be represented as one or two failed AW rolls.<br/><br/>Second, cornering a dude and opening fire isn't go aggro. The rules are pretty clear that in cases like that, a roll is pointless. You're just doling out harm. I don't see what's not satisfying about that, when you've put prep into fictional positioning that puts you exactly where you want to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398668/#Comment_398668" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T16:20:50+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  4:20PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you do something really easy, roll and add the appropriate stat.

Still, it could happen: for instance, if the Brainer is using a gang to attack their enemies... should they still be rolling at -2?<br/><br/>Still, it can come up in various situations. A certain fictional action seems very appropriate and likely to work (in the game fiction), but you're not sure you should actually do it because the dice odds look so poor.<br/><br/>It seems to me that it's a good feature of any ruleset when the "underdog" character can do something to even the odds so they can face serious opposition. In most games, there are some resources you can spend or some fictional positioning you can use, which translate into mechanical bonuses.<br/><br/>In AW, though, there is a sense that "those odds are as good as it's going to get".<br/><br/>If you don't like my example, how about a character with a low Sharp stat who puts a great deal of effort into getting information on a certain person or situation. (How about setting up some cameras to get a better angle on your enemy's position?) Wouldn't it be nice to give them a better "read" result?<br/><br/>Have you actually used the "+1" in play? It doesn't sound like you have, and I suspect, just like the "-1", this is a situation where a different solution might suit the nature of the AW better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398670/#Comment_398670" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T16:26:25+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  4:26PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall, what would this look like in our hypothetical scenarios?

That's the reward for having that sort of positioning. You get the honey jar without getting stung.\n<blockquote>If you don't like my example, how about a character with a low Sharp stat who puts a great deal of effort into getting information on a certain person or situation.

If we're having a charged exchange and I've been secretly spying on you, that info I gained from spying is going to guide what I say and do during that exchange, which will in turn guide your replies, which then allows me to target the questions I ask with the Hold from my "read" move in a more purposeful and focused way. And if you fail your "read" roll, well, having a low Sharp makes you pretty obtuse.\n<blockquote>Have you actually used the "+1" in play? It doesn't sound like you have, and I suspect, just like the "-1", this is a situation where a different solution might suit the nature of the AW better.</blockquote>\nNo, I haven't used it in AW. You're probably right about a different solution suiting the game better. I tend to favor the simple and easy to employ solutions over those that are more involved, but if someone else comes up with a perfect and simple alternative I'll be more than happy to borrow it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398673/#Comment_398673" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T17:00:32+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  5:00PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2012 5:03PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you <i>read</i> and act on the MC's answers, that's +1 right there.

Great topic. I can't address everything right now, but I'll answer your question.\n<blockquote>If you're a character in AW, and you need to get something done you have a low stat in, how do you approach it?</blockquote>\nIf I'm playing a passionate, driven character (and I probably am) I fucking go for it. I rarely play reasonable, cautious people, especially in the apocalypse world. Like Orly said, a miss means trouble, but it doesn't automatically mean failure, and if my brainer is going after someone with her shotgun, it's because she gives no fucks. When I kick in the door and let 'em have it with my shotty, maybe I get boned on that miss, but that NPC doesn't magically become shotgun-proof either.<br/><br/>(we're not 'rolling to hit' here, which we all know but I need to say it)<br/><br/>If my brainer is a timid, careful sort, then I hedge my bets. I avoid direct (non-weird) violence, I manipulate, observe, mind-fuck, and brain-whisper. Shit, man, the brainer is always the most dangerous character -- ap silent weapon -- with a look! When I need to get stuff done, I won't try to be a Gunlugger.<br/><br/>So, it depends. I play my character, not the stats (though, of course, as Jason said, one informs the other).<br/><br/>Also, as a player, failure is almost always fun. Protagonists fail. I'm not invested in my character's success as a primary goal. I'm concerned with <i>expressing</i> my character, first and foremost. Sometimes that means doing something 'stupid' or not ideal, because the character isn't perfect and strategic at all times. They're human.<br/><br/>There's lots more to say here, regarding preparation and modifying rolls. I'll be back. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398687/#Comment_398687" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T20:09:54+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  8:09PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My answer was pretty much Orlando Wilson's but there was something more I wanted to express.

Do I really care, but not really care about the consequences or what'll be trying to stop me? Or am I paranoid as all fuck and being real cagey? You don't roll for Reading a Charged Situation if the character isn't actually trying to read a charged situation, no matter if that's a mechanically prudent thing to do or not.<br/><br/>If I am being real careful and cagey, and just suck at it (and the situation is especially really deadly), then I might pander (as a player or character) for somebody to help me out, if I'm really committed to trying to succeed (-1 is WAY better than -2). Or I might just got for it, because the odds aren't that important and failure is at least as interesting as success (and maybe more interesting).<br/><br/>IMO, playing a character with integrity means not always doing the mechanically optimal thing, though it doesn't necessarily involve being stupid either (though sometimes it definitely does, or at least showing really poor judgment; like that thing Joe says in Monsterhearts about treating characters like stolen cars).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398768/#Comment_398768" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T14:13:08+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  2:13PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the player is able to fictionally position to rule-out a consequence, then that just ceases to be an option when it comes to consequences for failing that roll. If the player does something to fictionally improve their chances, then maybe a bonus is in order, but I prefer more concrete changes to the fiction.<br/><br/>Going back to the original example, if your Brainer corners their enemy and unloads, "you missed" isn't a potential consequence of a bad roll, but there are plenty of other things that could go wrong besides not hitting your target so I would still call for a roll. This is pretty much like the World of Dungeons Skill system.<br/><br/>If your Brainer saws off their shotgun to give it bigger spread, maybe a +1 bonus to your roll is appropriate. Or, you could interpret that change to mean +1 to damage if you do damage against an enemy from short-range. Or you could make it fictionally less difficult to "corner" the enemy since the gun has a wider spread.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398774/#Comment_398774" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T15:09:54+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  3:09PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2012 3:13PM by John_Harper.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, preparation!<br/><br/>There are several ways to get a bonus to a roll in AW, which have been mentioned here already. Help, reading a sitch and taking +1, some character moves, etc.<br/><br/>There's also fictional positioning, which is a big deal, and well-understood 'round these parts, I think.<br/><br/>There's a link between the two, though, that maybe isn't always obvious. I see people struggle a bit with this sometimes. It has to do with reading and then acting on the answers.<br/><br/>So, first, let's think of the read moves as workspaces, because they are. The player asks 'how could I get x?' and the MC tells them the requirements. Take your Hard-2 brainer. She decides to go murder a guy with her shotgun, and that guy is in a position to fight, and she doesn't want to fight because fighting is bad news for her and she's not throwing her life away just yet thanks. So, she goes out to his compound, hunkers down and she reads the sitch. And she asks "what's my best way past his ability to fight me?" And the MC answers, "Well, he's holed up in there pretty good, with his gang, too, but everyone has to sleep right? When they're out on a raid, if you hid in his room, you could murder him when he came back and went to bed."<br/><br/>That exchange is a kind of roadmap now. You want to make a preparation to get something (in this case, an enemy at your mercy) and the MC has told you the <b>best way</b> to do it. Sure, yeah, later you get +1 to a roll when you follow through, but that's small potatoes. You probably won't even have to roll once you achieve the position.<br/><br/>Of course, getting into position could be simple ("everyone leaves, roaring out on their bikes into the burn flats. there's no guard because, seriously who would go into that place on purpose?") or it could be dicey, depending on the fiction ("crippled Roarke is left behind, clutching the chains of the guard dogs in one hand, sucking on a bottle of that rotgut with the other"). But, because of the asked-and-answered structure of the read move, you know that hiding in his room and waiting for your victim to fall asleep is literally <b>the best way</b> to get him at your mercy.<br/><br/>(Aside 1: Are there any other RPGs that give you such a gift of effective preparation like that? The GM literally tells you the best way to do something. I can't think of any off the top of my head.)<br/><br/>(Aside 2: At PAX, I asked Vincent if there was anything he'd change about AW now, and he said he would tweak the 'read' moves. On a miss, you still get to ask one -- and the MC makes a hard move, as normal. I've adopted that as an official rule and I love it.)<br/><br/>There's still so much to discuss.

He has incentive to be sharp in play. He may not be the hardest badass in town, he may not be the coldest or the hottest, but his wits are a tool that can give him an edge, and he'll use it. And every so often he'll be a bit too clever and his wits will get him into trouble.<br/><br/>That guy with the Sharp -1? Well, he ain't so sharp. Maybe he's hard as sprung steel. Maybe he's not to be fucked with and he's like a one man killing machine. That guy? He goes charging in without hesitating, cuz what good can come from him hanging back? He's at his best when he's being a hard mutherfucker and not trying to be so smart. He's Hard. He's not Sharp. <br/><br/>Which is why I don't find modifying rolls very compelling. If its take a +1 forward because you had a conversation, or heard a thing in passing, or because you examined the door before opening it, I think the game loses something.<br/><br/>I also like that the MC isn't concerned with how difficult something is beyond whether the outcome is certain or uncertain. I like that the MC is occupied with how difficult something looks, rather than how difficult it actually is. I'd rather the dice tell me if it was too difficult after the PC makes the attempt, rather than figuring that out in advance. Sometimes something looks more difficult than it is. The MC doesn't know.

The stats are descriptors for a reason, and they play out just like they look they will. If the Brainer can stack bonuses to become an aggro machine, it takes away from his iconic playstyle. He's just <i>not</i> the dude that bumrushes a room with an assault rifle, and that's mechanically reinforced. If he manuevers himself into a winning position and shoots someone, then just let him do it; he's earned it. But if you follow the fiction through to its logical conclusion, you'll often find that bonuses are unnecessary. You either <i>do </i>it, or it's uncertain. If it's uncertain, then make with the dice. But if it's more logical that it would just <i>happen</i>, there's nothing wrong with saying so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399136/#Comment_399136" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T11:34:24+00:00" title="November 29, 2012 11:34AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I find interesting about the <em>specific</em> moves in AW is this: there is no move for shooting someone who can't threaten you.

And, as we've discussed in this thread, giving a bonus to a character in a beneficial position is not necessarily the best way to go or in the spirit of the rules.<br/><br/>That said, this thread got me thinking about dice combinations a few days ago, and I worked out the probabilities. Here's my favourite solution:\n<blockquote><br/><i>When your character has taken the time and effort to secure an advantage</i> which should improve their chances, the MC will give you an extra die to roll. The MC can choose one:<br/>* You've earned a meaningful advantage. Take a d4.<br/>* You've managed to garner an unusually strong advantage or assume a extraordinarily strong position. Take a d6.<br/>* You've positioned yourself in such a way that you have a truly overwhelming advantage over your opposition. Take a d8.<br/>Roll all the dice at the same time and add the two highest dice together to get your result.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is nice: an extra d4 gives you a little less than a +1 (on average, +0.7 or so), but tends to turn misses into partial hits without increasing your odds of a strong (10+) hit very much. Seems perfect for what we're trying to model.<br/><br/>The extra d6 is roughly equal to +1.45, and the extra d8 is more or less like adding +2.3.<br/><br/>So, if you want a "when you have an advantage" kind of mechanic, the extra d4 is a nice touch, meaningful (reduces your miss chance by about 14-15%) but not too strong.<br/><br/>Once again, I'm not sure this is necessary or desirable. But the math is nice! I'm putting together a sort of Apocalypse World hack using this right now. I'll post it when I have the time to write it up!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399265/#Comment_399265" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T13:58:15+00:00" title="November 30, 2012  1:58PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used 3d6 keep 2 in play a little bit, and more of the keep high for advantage than keep low for disadvantage. Statistically and extra die works out to be slightly less good than a +2 (before other modifiers), and tends to eliminate misses, in favour of 7-9 results, which you still get a bunch of. So I've noticed generally what Paul has, though I didn't try different-sized dice.<br/><br/>It worked okay, was pretty rare but a nice bonus. I wanted it to help counteract disadvantage, but there wasn't that much going on there, so I dunno.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399741/#Comment_399741" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T18:25:50+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  6:25PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just for fun, as a test of this concept, I've put together a "proof of concept" game using different die types in Apocalypse World:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17652/apocalypse-world-for-kids-the-bureau-an-aw-hack-with-different-die-types" rel="nofollow">The Bureau</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
