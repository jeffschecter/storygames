(puzzle, tactical challenges, alliances with NPCs?)<br/><br/>Was there consensus among the players in the direction the game was going?  Or was it always designed to be a somewhat adversarial campaign?<br/><br/><br/>These are some of the possible leading questions I came up with from the top of my head.

(They had just reached level 17 -- 9th level spells!  And this campaign had started at level 1 back in 2005!)<br/><br/>As we sat there, however, they kept talking about what had happened in the game, and what they were going to do next.  Then they turned to me and said, "Hey, can we use that artifact we found to ask a question about the future?"<br/><br/>I blinked and said, "Sure."  So we got the dice back out and roleplayed through it, with one player risking his sanity in order to get a glimpse (however vague) of what the future holds.<br/><br/>And then they had to discuss, in character, what it meant and how it affected their plans.  It took us a while before we got back to leveling up the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241242/#Comment_241242" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T10:40:17+00:00" title="November 10, 2009 10:40AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's more subjective, for me.

I can make at least one generalization, though.<br/><br/>Sometimes after seeing a really good movie or watching a good TV show, I find myself replaying scenes in my head after the fact, thinking about how awesome this part was, or what the implications of that part was, or how sad that scene was. And it's not always about the 'splosions and plot twists, sometimes it's more meditative. Solaris (the Soderbergh version) and Gattaca are good examples of the latter. Neither movie is "teh awesome", but I found myself turning both of them over in my head for a long while after I saw them.<br/><br/>So, it's not an absolute requirement, but pretty much any game that gives me (and hopefully everyone else!) that same feeling is probably a winner. My indie group tends to e-mail each other a lot after we get home from the game, which is a good gauge on how mutual the "good movie" feeling was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241263/#Comment_241263" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T11:33:08+00:00" title="November 10, 2009 11:33AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it when there is shouting and arm-waving and laughing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241291/#Comment_241291" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T13:11:51+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  1:11PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't get a sick feeling in your gut like you just wasted four hours of your life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241292/#Comment_241292" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T13:15:12+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  1:15PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We laughed so hard someone almost stopped breathing.<br/><br/>Everyone congratulated the winner for a job well done.<br/><br/>Something happened that made more than one person say "huh...that was pretty cool."

(And those accomplishments can be addressing premise, basking in the glow of genre, kicking ass, whatever.) After the game, the excitement comes from looking back at how many amazing things happened, and how every moment was well spent. I think, yes, I really want to do that again!<br/><br/>As you can guess, an unsuccessful night of gaming is the converse of all the above, and I think we all know what that feels like well enough that I don't need to explain further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anakusis" title="Anakusis"><img alt="Anakusis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anakusis">Anakusis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241914/#Comment_241914" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T18:25:16+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  6:25PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first answer would be a game where I had fun hands down.
