We set it up to provide a UK-based outlook on these things (although we are delighted to have contributors from across Europe, from the US, Canada, Australia and other places). <br/><br/>The Endeavour consists of two main elements: firstly (and most importantly) there are our forums where people can talk (much like Story Games, the Forge and other sites which have provided influence and inspiration) about their designs, give feedback to others, discuss publishing issues, give actual play commentary and so forth. <br/><br/>The second element is to give a collective presence for small-press publishers at UK conventions. At the moment (for logistical reasons and for other reasons that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll go into below) the \xe2\u20ac\u02dcconvention presence\xe2\u20ac\u2122 is restricted to those who set up the site, but there are plans to change this in the future.<br/><br/>So how has it all gone?<br/><br/>The site has been home for some excellent and productive threads, mainly in relation to conventions (attending them, running games at them, etc), publishing issues and games design (in approximately that order of activity). Taking a critical view, there has been much less actual play that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d like on the site and much less comment on AP threads than their should be. I myself am guilty of not giving enough attention to this part of the site. There is a \xe2\u20ac\u02dccore\xe2\u20ac\u2122 membership of the forums that does most of the commenting on the site, so that we\xe2\u20ac\u2122d like to see change and evolve in the future. Any site that maintains a relatively static membership is either going to die or simply become a venue for the same old mutual backslapping and self-aggrandisement.<br/><br/>In terms of a convention presence, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve had members at Dragonmeet, Conception, Conflagration, Concrete Cow and Conpulsion, in varying capacities. At most of these we had a stall selling our wares, talking about games and encouraging people to come to the site and see what we have to offer in the way of feedback and discussion. On the whole, our convention presence has been good in terms of sales and feedback. We have established the Collective Endeavour as something that people look forward to seeing at UK cons. <br/><br/>The past few months have been a period of finding our feet, particularly in relation to o9ur convention presence. In future, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re keen to evolve and expand this presence. We also would love to see some well design games coming out of the Endeavour site over the next few months. There are already some serious possibilities there that feature strong design, an acceptance of critique and a dedication to producing a quality product.<br/><br/>So, this has been something of a self-analytical view of what we have been doing over at CE. We\xe2\u20ac\u2122d all be delighted if you popped by once in a while, cast your eye over the threads and maybe offered your comments. <br/><br/>Any further thoughts and feedback on how we could improve things, areas where we are perhaps going wrong and so forth would also be heartily appreciated.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64874/#Comment_64874" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T04:06:12+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  4:06AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2007 4:58AM by Rich Stokes.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malc,<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone who uses the site, I think there's a lot going for it and a lot of problems.  I think most (if not all) the problems stem from the fact that there's a "critical mass" which a web forum needs to reach to get the momentum going which it needs in order to be a vibrant community.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem is that when a designer posts a design thread there, it's read by 5, maybe 10 other people who may or may not give some feedback.  Posting that same thread on Storygames or The Forge will get it seen by 10 times as many people and is thus more likely to garner a response.  So I'm seeing the same thread started by the same designers on all three forums.  And there's great discussion going on on all three sites, but inevitably people get more feedback on the other two sites and so the thread on CE tends to die.  Not the end of the world or anything, but y'know, it's kind of a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm guilty as everyone of not posting enough.  But that's not going to change, I only have so much time and quite a lot of work.  Also, I'd rather spend time designing and writing than talking about design right now.  That <b>will</b> change as Umlaut gets nearer to completion, but hey, rock 'n roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe publishing advice I've read there has been excellent as well.  It's great having people like Jon Hodgeson there to talk candidly from the artist's point of view for example.  Also the anglocentric view on Cons, printing and shipping is pure gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64875/#Comment_64875" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T04:30:29+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  4:30AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're entirely correct about the lack of a critical mass for the forums to really get up and running. The next 6 months (pretty much up to dragonmeet 2007) will be the telling period where the entire endeavour either continues and improves or falls over and dies. I'm certainly wanting it to continue, to improve, to grow and become much more than just a talking shop for a select few people.<br><br>As you say, the sections on cons and publishing are strong and give good advice from the UK viewpoint. Game design and actual play are weaker, in terms of what is being discussed and what is coming out of them. I'd like to see more posts, stronger critique and a focus on improvement and quality (especially in design).<br><br>Thanks for the comments.<br><br>Cheers<br>Malcolm                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64876/#Comment_64876" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T04:35:24+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  4:35AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also pleased with the first 6 months of the Collective Endeavour. <br><br/>We've run indie games at most (all?) of the main UK games conventions since December, and exposed our games to a much wider audience. We've spouted about games design to people up and down the country, opening their eyes to the fact that they too can write a game. And we've started to build a UK-based community of indie games design.<br/><br/>But ... we've got a long way to go. <br/><br/>Dragonmeet aside, where we met/sold to/demoed to A LOT of new blood, I get the impression that a lot of our convention presence is preaching to the converted. This is no bad thing of course, as it fosters a community, but it would be nice to embrace new gamers.<br/><br/>The forums generate some interesting discussion, but it's very much driven by a handful of us (mainly the core members). And I've noticed the symptom Rich pointed out, whereby threads are posted on multiple sites to maximise discussion. Not that this is a bad thing, but at times it can get confusing!<br/><br/>Some of the features of the website are utterly unused - the blogs section is infrequently touched (and I'm always unsure whether I should post a blog there or a forum post), as is the projects section, which has the potential to be quite usable.<br/><br/>But all in all, a good start, from my point of view at least.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
