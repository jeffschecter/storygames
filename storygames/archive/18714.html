What kinds of things did you roll for the most, and what were typical outcomes like?<br/><br/>Now imagine that you're looking at a transcript of that play history. Which of those common types of rolls could you group together into "basic moves" of sorts, and what would they look like?<br/><br/>For example, I'm pretty sure John Harper wrote at some point that, in combat situations, if you rolled a 7-9 you'd probably accomplish whatever you were trying to do <i>and</i> get hit by your enemies. That's a typical outcome on a 7-9 for some kind of "in physical combat" move. But what about the miss and 10+ versions?<br/><br/>(If you have any GM/MC moves that aren't covered by the original AW/DW MC moves, tell us about those too!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420031/#Comment_420031" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T05:48:26+00:00" title="August 14, 2013  5:48AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you try to find something that is possible to be found: it might take a long time, you might find more than you wanted to or something else might go wrong.

Thanks!<br/><br/>Nick,<br/><br/>I'm not necessarily suggesting that we codify these things. But one of the interesting things about WoDu is that - I suspect - every group will, over time, gravitate to *different* types of regular move-use, or rulings, if you will. So wouldn't it be fun to examine that, to compare notes?<br/><br/>The answers won't necessarily look like regular AW moves, either. There might be stuff like, "roll+stat when you [...] except under these circumstances, where you don't bother rolling [...] but when <i>this</i> happens, don't bother, you generally just get some bad news instead. And if someone's sick, then go with the Die of Fate instead."<br/><br/>Thinking about standard uses might also get you thinking about when those "typical" situations <i>don't</i> apply, you know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420042/#Comment_420042" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T09:47:11+00:00" title="August 14, 2013  9:47AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WoDu's die mechanic as written is highly context and <i>outcome</i> dependent, and doesn't encourage the kind of constrained choices typical of AW/DW Moves.  In Dungeon Girls/Kids, I've tried to steer toward the most credible and interesting outcome or complication in a given situation for a Failure/Mixed Results outcome.  Successes constitute a payoff, with Crits delivering payoff with extra heroic advantage or oomph.  I use the Die of Fate to inspire interesting parameters ("How many orcs ARE there in that cave?") or answer questions like "Is there really treasure here?"  I don't use it as conflict resolution at all.<br/><br/>Combat is the one area where more standardized Move-like methodology could prove useful, but even that isn't necessary.  I don't always deal damage on a Mixed Result, but frequently try to pose an immediate threat or disadvantage, or a bigger complication the character can see start to unfold.  For me, a Failure means "Hurt 'em now."  A Mixed Result means "Turn up the threat or suspense," which <i>could</i> mean "Hurt 'em now" if doing so seems the best way to ratchet up the dramatic tension.  This principle isn't that different from non-combat situations.<br/><br/>It seems like you're asking for examples of use cases that might distill into useful principles.  That's cool, but I like the free-flowing judgment calls that go with WoDu.  Moves are fun because they drive the player to choosing among constraints, balancing advantages with costs.  WoDu doesn't do that, but drives the question "What's the most interesting outcome that could happen in this moment?"  Maybe most or all die mechanics purport to do so, but WoDu makes it much clearer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420055/#Comment_420055" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T11:52:21+00:00" title="August 14, 2013 11:52AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Everyone usually forgets the Die of Fate when talking about WoDu.
