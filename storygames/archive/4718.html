Marketing isn't just advertising, it addresses target audience, market placement, distribution channels, promotional campaigns, ongoing product support and product pitches.<br/><br/>The contest challenges you to find alternatives to a standardized and mundane marketing and publishing market. I have significant fears that the indie community might lose its diverse approach and slip into taken-for-granted homogeneity. I fear that the larger RPG community has already done this in many places.<br/><br/>The contest is basically to design a kick-ass business plan for a game. Here's how the Elaborate Ploy Design Contest works: you take an RPG and design a marketing plan, that covers the following sections:<br/><br/><b>Pitch and Executive Summary</b><br/><br/>Develop an introduction to your game. This can be a pitch, a back cover blurb, an introduction to the game, or part of an executive summary included in a business plan. It can also be multiple things \u2013 several pitches designed for different audiences, etc.<br/><br/><b>Research and Development</b><br/><br/>Outline how the game will be developed. What part will playtesting have in the game's development? Will you be unleashing an Ashcan, beta, preview edition, Gencon edition, or similar half-developed version of the game?<br/><br/>How will you gage market interest as the product is developed and released?<br/><br/><b>Form Factor </b><br/><br/>What shape will the product* take? Will it be a physical product, a PDF, an audio file, a Youtube video? Will there be multiple forms released? If so, how will they differ and how will the form support each iteration of the game?<br/><br/>*Product does not imply <i>commercial product</i>. That is only one option.<br/><br/><b> Budget and Profit Projections</b><br/><br/>Include some detail about how you see money fitting into your equation. Will this be a free game with only in-kind support? Will the game have $400 of art and a $500 printing budget? Will the game cost thousands to release the way you envision?<br/><br/>Talk about convention costs, distribution costs, and price point.<br/><br/>This section doesn't need to be long, but it must be included.<br/> <br/><b>Advertising and Promotion</b><br/><br/>How will the game be promoted? Will there be extensive online advertising? Will there be a heavy con presence? Will you and two other people get in a van and do a promotional tour?<br/><br/>Word of mouth counts as advertising. Account for it. Peer and industry reviews counts as advertising too.<br/><br/>Talk about what kind of advertising and marketing the game will have. Think about more than just putting up web banners*, because advertising has a much bigger scope in this definition.<br/><br/><br/>*Although that can definitely be part of it, and I'm not knocking it!<br/><br/><b>Ongoing Support</b><br/><br/>Discuss how the creator, the publisher and the gamers will support the game. Will the be a huge, active fan community? Will their be ongoing supplements*? Will there be free previews, character sheets, and game materials?<br/><br/>Ongoing support and Advertising can be totally separate creatures or blended together and indiscernible from one another. An active player community and online resources are great advertising. A good advertising campaign draws attention to the ongoing support the game has.<br/><br/>*If so, this should also be included in the form factor and profit projections.<br/><br/><br/><b>To recap, that's:<br/>-Pitch and Executive Summary<br/>-Research and Development<br/>-Form Factor<br/>-Budget and Profit Projections<br/>-Advertising and Promotions<br/>-Ongoing Support</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106430/#Comment_106430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-03T14:39:44+00:00" title="November  3, 2007  2:39PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You will develop a comprehensive marketing plan which includes the six components above. There is no minimum size, but the maximum length is: twenty pages (if written), twenty minutes (if audio), something of equal depth (if a web site, interactive medium, mind map, etc). You are not constricted by form, so long as you keep in mind two things:<br/>a.) It needs to be possible to send this to me, or link me to it. (It can't be such a large file that I can't accept it in my inbox).<br/>b.) You aren't making the actual game itself, and so the form cannot include \u201cgame book\u201d.<br/><br/>You will also develop two Artifacts of the game.<br/><br/><b>Artifacts</b><br/><br/>You will create two actual physical parts of the game's marketing. This can mean any of the following: Designing the back cover (complete with pretty pictures and everything, if you want!), designing a web banner, writing a fake review of the game, creating a flash tutorial of part of the game*, creating an alternate character sheet for free download, developing an Intro/Preview Book*, designing a home page for an online game, etc.<br/><br/>The rest of your entry is planning and outline. The Artifacts are proof of what it will ACTUALLY look like. They are samples taken from the stuff that actually reaches the customers.<br/><br/><br/>*Keep in mind you aren't writing the game, and while a tutorial or character sheet will show off cool parts of a system, the task here isn't writing the system. Consider it like creating a character sheet for the Reverse/Engineer contest or something.<br/><br/><br/>So, there are two categories for the contest:<br/><br/><b>Already Existing Game</b><br/><br/>Pick a game that already exists. Re-do their entire development, publishing, marketing and support outline. Do you think that Dogs should have been taught entirely by word of mouth, by volunteer \u201cWatchdogs\u201d who toured from town to town teaching the game to indie RPG fans? Do you think Rifts should have been a single, self-contained book?<br/><br/>This is your chance to take a game you love, hate, or have conflict with, and help it deliver on its vision better. Obviously it's not awesome to simply record what they've already done \u2013 take the game and product in new directions with your plan! You can either redesign what they did from the ground up, or suggest changes that could take place now.<br/><br/>The prize for this category is a $30 gift certificate to Indie Press Revolution.<br/><br/><b>A Fictional Game</b><br/><br/>Pick a game that doesn't exist, and design an entry for this contest based on that game. You aren't allowed to write the game, and it can't be one you've been working on already. It needs to be a game that doesn't exist.<br/><br/>I'm going to be entering the contest for fun (and will remove my entry from judging and prizes), and I'm entering in this category. The non-existant game I'm developing a marketing strategy for is <i>Angelic Pervert</i>, a game of hentai, sexual obscenity and finding personal boundaries. So that's an example idea.<br/><br/>The prize for this category is a $50 grant toward writing a game. This grant will be given in two parts: $25 upfront, and $25 upon release or a significant publishing milestone (to be assessed dependent on who wins the contest). The grant does not need to go towards writing the game you enter into this contest, because you might enter a multimillion dollar plan, and obviously $50 won't support that.<br/><br/><br/><b> Judging</b><br/><br/>How judging works will be decided in another thread \u2013 because people care a lot about how judging works, I don't want to make that decision for others. I'm currently thinking that it will be peer-based (two entries each, maybe?) and there will be a small set of ratings given to the entrants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106431/#Comment_106431" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-03T14:40:57+00:00" title="November  3, 2007  2:40PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Donations</b><br/><br/>Finally, if anyone wants to contribute to the prizes, they can feel free to contact me at joepub88 (at) hotmail (dot) com.

I don't want people to make a game and then tack on a marketing plan afterwards. I want people thinking about how to market a game which they haven't created - either one that already exists, or one that doesn't exist.<br/><br/>The intent there is that marketing (as I'm using the word) isn't a simply by-product of game design - it is the core focus.<br/><br/>Now, for an example of something I think is A-OK, look at my thread about my entry (Angelic Pervert). It's a game that definitely DOESN'T exist. However, I've thought a bit about "What would this look like as a game?" And the pitch I wrote talks about a couple Cool System Pieces. But I've intentionally left them undefined and I have no idea how they work. One of my artifacts will be a RPGnet review of the game, and it's going to reference parts of the system and game interface. Again, I'm going to intentionally not define those things or create the way they work in the rules.<br/><br/>Basically, if you have an idea in your head, but haven't <i>made it into a game yet</i>*, then I think it's still in the spirit of the competition.<br/><br/><br/>*For whatever definition you have of that statement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106556/#Comment_106556" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T13:12:16+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  1:12PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Joe.

There are two categories for the competition:<br/>-Already Existing Game<br/>-A Fictional Game<br/><br/>Pick one or the other.<br/><br/>Does that answer your question?<br/><br/>Jonathan Walton, just to backtrack, because I missed an earlier question... You mentioned:\n<blockquote>EDIT: I assume that when you say "You aren't allowed to write the game," you mean, "You aren't allowed to submit the game as one of the Artifacts during this contest," yeah? Because, otherwise, that's a really evil rule, requiring folks to come up with hot concepts and then abandon them. </blockquote>\nWhat I meant by this is that it can't be a game you are currently already writing, or have already written.<br/>I totally hope that once the contest is over, or underway, entrants look at their stuff and say "You know, I could really get into this game!"<br/><br/>And then, here's a crazy little trick: They've already got a blueprint for how to develop the game once it's written - how to playtest and develop it, how to solicit feedback during development, how to publish it, promote it, and support it. And then, what you have is an instant solution to the "half baked", "rushed to print", "printed and then abandoned" and "unsupported and lacking community" problems.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting that people should, in general, create a marketing strategy and then create a game to fill it. But I think that establishing a line of thinking that weighs in the social and market context of a game, alongside game development, would do a lot of good to a lot of games.<br/><br/>Hm. That's part of the theory behind the contest. But mostly I just want to see what radical-and-yet-plausible ideas people come up with for these kinds of things when they think outside of the standard hand of options.<br/><br/>Kevin Allen Junior, you asked:\n<blockquote>will you accept a large file that is posted to a file share site like Sendspace, or a public FTP server?</blockquote>\nYes. I can accept a link to a large file.<br/><br/>Tangentially related: I'd like it if you kept the size of your entry to a digestible amount, in terms of what you're putting judges through. The basic guideline is a maximum of twenty written pages, or 20 minutes of audio, or something vaguely equivilant. <br/><br/>Oh, and I have Powerpoint but not the Mac one.<br/><br/><br/>Andy, you asked:\n<blockquote>Any possibility of a pushback or is that deadline cut in stone, with like razor-sharp crystals covering it? Perhaps like the 26th, or the following week? </blockquote>\nAndy, I'm totally cool with a pushback, provided everyone supports it. I have no personal deadlines for it, 20 days just seemed like the right amount initially - long enough to ahve time, but short enough to put pressure on people to finish.<br/><br/>Is there a specific reason why the 26th would be better than the 23rd, other than an extra 3 days?<br/><br/><br/><b>To Everyone: A Poll</b><br/>Would you like a deadline extension of a few days?

One question here: I'm looking at using an existing game for this, but it makes doing some parts of your 6-part structure difficult. Specifically, research and development and, even more so, form factor. I'm willing to discuss how a game could be changed for the market, but its not usually the marketing exec's job to redesign the product, only to market it. How much will I miss out if I say nope, the game is made, let's work from there?<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying the game I chose is perfect, and believe me I'd probably redesign it all over if I had the opportunity and the skill. But I'm specifically going with a pre-existing game, and if I did start rewriting it, I'd feel I was wandering outside the bounds of the pre-existing game criteria. So, is there a problem with keeping the game as written and only addressing the marketing side of things? Did that make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108712/#Comment_108712" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-18T03:12:30+00:00" title="November 18, 2007  3:12AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shevaun, my thought was that you'd actually be re-developing the same game. Think of it this way: The creator decides that they aren't 100% satisfied with the game. They write a new edition. They call you up and say, "Shevaun, I've got the new edition of my game ready to start publishing. How should I publish? In which markets? How can I support the product better?"<br/><br/>I was asking, by default, for you to re-design parts of the game's already existing marketing, in order to better deliver on the game's content. That includes re-assessing the physical product and all support materials.<br/><br/>If you don't want to change what already exists, that's fine too. But in that case, I think what you'd want to do is look at what already exists, and explain how it delivers for the game, and how it comes up short. And where it comes up short, create measures to better support it.<br/><br/><br/><i>Example: Let's say your game of choice is Gore Thunder III. Gore Thunder III is published as a b&amp;w interior game, hardcover book. The marketing campaign is largely online banners. The default option is:<br/><br/>1.) Redevelop Gore Thunder III's physical product and already existing support mechanisms. In this case, say "Well, I think that the gorepunk, heavy violence premise should be backed up with some full colour artwork... get that visceral connection!" And look at the banners, and say, "We can spend that money better elsewhere. What about better con presence at horror and spec fic conventions?"<br/><br/>2.) Assess what Gore Thunder III is already doing, and create solutions to carry it further. This might include "Hm, the advertising materials are done in a different style than the game's cover and interior. Maybe some better brand unity?" It might include, "The web ad campaign should be supported with a magazine ad campaign, running in X and Y."</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108713/#Comment_108713" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-18T03:15:50+00:00" title="November 18, 2007  3:15AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>and only addressing the marketing side of things? </blockquote>\nThis contest assumes a different definition of marketing than yours might.

I think that there's not going to be a lot of "midway through" conversation in this contest... a lot of initial ideas, and a lot of final proofing, but not a lot of whatever would lie in between.<br/><br/>I'd be interested in seeing a thread pop up for you, though.
