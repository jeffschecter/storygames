I was witness to this awesome-ness. That gun was just a tool - we could have used it for good.<br/><br/>For me: <br/><br/>My werewolf paranormal, normally "One of the Pack", not visiting his crush in the hospital with the rest of the team, but rather going back to the vaults and releasing another werewolf in hopes of finding his real pack. Of course, he really lead me to Dr. Nightmare and told me that he was our pack leader.                        </div>

                            For me?  One of my fireteam stabbing a VC with his bayonet.  The stakes: if he won the challenge it would be a VC with a gun.  If the guy trying to stop him won the challenge then the guy got stabbed but it is a villager with a broom that the soldier just murdered.  He ended up hoisting the guy with the gun up over his head bathing in a shower of the VC's blood.  I am almost ashamed to say that the scene sold <b>Carry</b> for me.<br/><br/>Oh, then there was the time I, burned and beaten, face in the snow, whispered into the ice fortelling Fred's character's watery death <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Oh hey, yeh, seriously. My highlight from that game was actually the moment afterwards, when Don said "So, are we just going to gloss over the part where we clear out and burn down this village?" and the other players simultaneously went "No!"<br/><br/>Understand, this was in a totally "we need to see what our characters are going to be doing and how it's going to mess with them to do this" moment, not a "yay burning!" moment.<br/><br/>It was very good.                        </div>

                            Dreamation was a total blast!  <br/>
Highlights--<br/>
One Night:  As Graf von Babbenhausen, Nazi Dwarf political officer, taking over the Hindenburg in order to impress a girl--and carry out some nefarious deed.  <br/>
Grey Ranks:  As Josef, watching my older brother fail to rescue our younger brother from the Germans after he _promised_ to save him.<br/>
Ganakagok:  Brett's female tribe member wandering alone on the ice in search of her true love and nearly freezing to death until finding a small ivory carving he dropped that then led her to him. <br/>
Spirit of the Century:  Andrew Mellon deciding to go to Lakehurst on May 6, 1937 in order to greet the Hindenburg and pick up an incoming package.  And Paul Mellon rescuing his sister Ailsa and escaping from the Christian Thuggi cult after a dramatic horse chase!<br/>
Capes:  As Major Victory, single-handedly defeating Chemico's attack on Justice Tower--but then seeing Hyperion get all the credit!  Oh, and in the same game--the rivalry between the two villains Chemico and Iron Brain where they kept defeating each other' s plans. <br/>
D&amp;D:  When the characters played by Bill, Dave, Mike, Vince, and Shawn decrypted a secret message from the Princess that said, 'Help me!'  (Sure, it's a cliche.)<br/>
The Burning Wheel:  The Duel of Wits between Mordred and Palamedes where Mordred convinced King Arthur to name Mordred as heir to the throne but Palamedes was compensated by gaining Arthur's backing to lead a Crusade to the Holy Land!<br/>
What a great four days of games.<br/>

                            Highlights of my weekend at Dreamation:<br/><br/>Friday night, as Nathan, DaveC, and Joshua and I play <i>carry: a game about war</i> in the hotel lobby, I point out that CNN on the tv at the empty bar behind us is showing still photos of soldiers killed in action in Iraq. Also my character, Willy "Big White" White, an African-American with a serious racial grudge, lets Joshua's character shoot the squad's cracker, who had just called me the N word. Scary.<br/><br/>After midnight Friday, I describe some issues that have come out of <a href="http://verge.legendary.org" rel="nofollow">Verge</a> playtests. DaveC and my NJ friend Jon help me rewrite the conflict resolution system. We stay up late and I sleep through my Saturday morning <i>Everyway</i> game.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon, Shawn de Arment and I jump into a Goodman Games playtest for one of their D&amp;D 3.5 "classic dungeon crawl" adventures. He and I try our damnedest to make that session awesome for the other four players there.<br/><br/>Later Saturday night, Shreyas, Russell Collins, Joshua, and I playtest <i>Snow from Korea</i> (by Shreyas). The game seriously, seriously rocks despite having some small issues. We all proceed to suggest things to make his game even more fun, and test them on the spot. My samurai faces down Shreyas' over a still pool of water, then destroys all his own attachment to the world, reaching a perfect Zen state. He is later slain by Joshua's ninjas as he meditates on his tatami mat but his ghost returns to haunt Joshua's samurai. <br/><br/>After midnight Saturday, Joshua, DaveC, Jon from NJ, and Ben help me playtest the new ideas for <i>Verge</i>. I have to convince Ben that it's okay to tell me how much the unfinished rules on that page of scribbled notes sucks before he'll join us. After three and a half hours of feverish role-play and redesign, <i>Verge</i> rocks likes it's never rocked before and Ben threatens to steal the game mechanics if I don't finish the game soon.<br/><br/>Sunday morning, DaveC and I help Jason Morningstar set up the IPR booth. Brendan mentions that he hasn't really had to do anything at all that weekend for the booth and instead could play and have fun, and I bask in the glory that is the indie publishing community. I mellow out with various folks and get to know them a little better. On the drive home later, I realize that this community contains dozens of folks that I'd want as close friends if only I knew them better (and I have high standards). Y'all are <i>good people</i>. I made a number of personal connections this weekend and it feels too exhibitionistic to gush about specific people in this forum. I'll just say that I want to spend more time with a lot of you.                        </div>

And then a prophet who had survived being burnt for the murder of the old chief led the people to the ways of the Sun and the end of their old life, and a crazy grandmother became the last Ancestor, weeping for her loss.  "And her tears were the rain, and the people knew that she wept, but had forgotten why."  Beautiful.  All I did was watch.                        </div>

                            I met a lot of the people writing the indie-press games I've been getting into a lot lately.  I also put out a concept for a game I've been working on during the sunday morning game design workshop, which was really exciting.<br/>
<br/>
Did a couple of really great live action events put on by PST productions and Knights Realm.<br/>
<br/>
Had a really great, really big discussion on all things larp for the podcast.  It was a really big group but there were so many good ideas flying around!<br/>
<br/>
It was a really awesome time.                        </div>

<p>I wasn't in that Snow from Korea game, Dave. Was there another Joshua there I didn't meet?</p>
<p>We played some really excellent games. I'll put more in later, but my two highlights were that game of Carry that put me on the verge of tears for, I dunno, the last two hours of play, and the game of Shock: played with Dan, Dave, Ben, and me on Saturday night. It was recorded, so the AP will be thorough. Which is good because it's the single best game of Shock: I've ever played.</p>
<p>Verge is poised to be a radical new direction in fiction creation. It's now a board game that generates fiction. It's really, really fun.</p>
<p>I'll edit in details when I've got a little time. Thanks, everyone, for some really excellent games.</p>

Joanna, that would have<i> ruled.</i>  I really, really like <i>How We Came to Live Here</i> and enjoyed playing with you.  If we'd had more time, those four characters would have had excellent, tangled futures.                        </div>

                            In Judd's Dictionary of Mu game, I, the Khan of all Khans, have just sacrificed the Lady of Silt (who is revered to our people) to History-Eater (demon-sword formerly belonging to the Witch-King of Stygia.) when one of the Khans tells me that the people are murmuring about what I have done.  I hack off his head and carry it outside and tell the people that a Khan has told me that they are unhappy with my actions and that I want them to all talk with him about it and decide what they want to do, and then I throw the severed head out into the crowd.<br/>

Thanks, man!<br/><br/>And thanks to Judd and my fellow players--nemomeme, jenskot, and Terry--who created/facilitated such a positive experience for me.  It was a fantastic game and it showed me how fun gaming could be again, after having been burned again and again for so long.  I have a lot of energy to take back to my home table now.  I hope I didn't step on anyone's toes as I destroyed the world, but, DAMN I needed that.                        </div>

                            Oh, I forgot a highlight. <br/><br/>I found special six-sided dice in the dealer's room. They had different smiley faces on them: big smiley (elated), regular smiley (happy), flat-lipped smiley (apathetic), frowny face (sad), big frowny face with sad eyes (despairing), peeved smiley (angry).<br/><br/>I bought five, realizing that I could now <b>roll to overcome my grief</b>. Dave Cleaver has insisted that I design a game for these dice.                        </div>

                            Ganakagok - My prized maiden throwing away her life to search through the snowy wastes for her true love, at last knocking on the door of his hut and collapsing into his arms as he opens it, an ivory figurine he carved tumbling from her hands.<br/>

Grey Ranks - Emily already mentioned it, but my character breaking down and crying and just wanting to go home to her mom. I always feel awkward roleplaying moments like this with people I don't know all that well, but it was a satisfying moment at the table for me.<br/>
<br/>
Gods - When the Machinists Guild was vying for the right to build the temples of the goddess Niam, a goddess of nature, so that they could build temples of smoke and machinery and steam in her honor. And they were sincere in their belief that such wonderful temples would please her.<br/>
<br/>
Capes - When Parasite (a crazy supervillain hosting an alien parasite) snared the Clown (a crazy homocidal supervillain with chainsaws) and pulled him into its HR Giger-esque nest in the middle of this large supervillain gathering, burbling about the Clown being his father and the Clown patting him on the head and saying, "That's my boy." Everyone at the table had an "Ew." moment.<br/>

Meg, Vincent and I used them fairly extensively in just the way Andy describes in our long-running freeform/co gm'd game based on Ars Magica.  <br/><br/>One time we started a session of this game with the aftermath of a battle with dragon spawn that had begun at the end of last session. We figured out who was there and rolled a smiley face/frowny face die (which is how I think of them) for each person. Two grogs were near a flambeau mage who was adversarial with our primary characters, one had a frowny face, one had the really frowny face.   I rolled for my character, Soraya, and got the angry face. *Bingo* I knew just what had happened. The stupid frickin fire mage had torched one of his own grogs who had gotten in the way, or had been affected by an emotional attack of the dragons.   Instant situation.  There was a long standing theme about treatment of servants and companions as people vs. chattel. Soraya was something pissed that he would be so offhand about his own men.                        </div>

Oh yeah.  If we want to take my frame at the beginning of the game seriously, this is a tape that I'd totally watch over and over with my friends, then suddenly figure out that you could order anime *on the internet* and scrimp together $100 for the boxed set.<br/><br/>I'm sad that, in this case, I can't buy the boxed set at all.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            My whole first convention experience was a highlight.  Well worth flying out from the west coast.  What an awesome bunch of creative, intelligent yet unassuming people there are in this community.  I'd like to especially thank Shane for striking up a conversation after our Shock game, inviting me to tag along, and introducing me to several people.  Everyone was really friendly.  Jason and Judd made special efforts to make sure I felt welcome and was having a good time.  My own character's highlights were few as the sheer amount of awesome sort of put me into a reactive mode for the convention.  When I manage to recover a little I plan on posting AP vignettes elsewhere.  For now though -  <br/><br/>Misspent Youth:  It was really neat to see the playtest process.  There were no sacred cows.  Rob has done a lot of work on this game, had a couple playtests prior to this, and was looking to potentially change a LOT of things based on the play experience and great feedback he was getting from this third playtest.<br/><br/>Shock: The collaborative world creation was really fun.  The End of Scarcity as a Shock, with Integrity being currency and marriage restrictions based on Integrity differences made great catalysts for engaging conflicts.  Having Jeff as my Nanite Computer Overmind Antagonist was just cool.<br/><br/>Polaris:  Holy crap, what a non-stop stream of awesome ideas, agonizing choices, pathos, and tragedy there was coming from all my fellow players.  To return the dark star fragment to the Remnant that he hoped would save the People, my character Indus had to harden his heart against his love, Maia.  "The Call of Home" compass thing that was to guide him back to the Remnant was instead shining towards her heart.  And then when he returned home, having  sworn an oath to do whatever Corvus would have him do, he was forced to destroy the fragment, which released thousands of demons and sorrow upon the People.  Just getting to play Polaris with Ben was a highlight.  Polaris is probably the design I am most impressed with among all the small press rpgs I've read and played.<br/><br/>Spirit of the Century: Again, amazing players.  Last time I mention that because that was a constant in all my games - no exception.  An insane number of highlights in an abbreviated session.  For my character, throwing a wrench into the engine of Baron von Blood's flying craft to good effect was fun.  As was attempting to distract Zombie Kong by dressing as Fay Wray with a white gown and blond wig, but having it be ineffective because my character (Jane "Flygirl" Justice) was a tomboy.  I love FATE.  It's an Fun Machine -  just insert players.<br/><br/>Dictionary of Mu: Epic.  It would be like being forced to choose between children, but if I had to pick, this was my favorite game of the con.  Everyone was saying "Yes" to each other in startling and amazing ways.  I am enthused about Sorceror where I never was before.  I'm going to go back and read the core book and supplements a third time to see if I can now "get it," and then try to get it to the table this year.  Shane's horrific portrayal of the Khan of all Khan's was enthralling.  He may have been actually channeling him.  For my character, when trying to summon a defender for Battlehymn, I failed and instead found a beauteous presence named "Lightbringer."  Hmmm...  When he told me his need was to corrupt the powerful, I had to turn him away rather than attempt to bind him.  Even knowing that the Khan's army was approaching and our city's defenses would likely not be sufficient without Lightbringer's help, there would be no deal with the devil and the fragile peace we had wrought in Battlehymn was now in jeopardy.  Judd is an amazing GM and plays demons in a very spooky, seductive way.  I could see how much fun it would be for the GM playing the demons for the sorcerors, making demands, whining, tempting.  Awesome.<br/><br/>DitV:  Man, I think most of us were wrecked by Sunday night.  I was having a hard time concentrating.  John's initiation scene with the "I hope I don't shoot my father a 2nd time tonight" was a clear highlight.  Messed.  Up.  It was great meeting Vincent and having him run New Chapel Town for us.  He is so self-effacing, low-key and gentle, even as he gleefuly pushes two d10s adding to "20", in a "Does Brother Isaiah (my character) die?" conflict.  Hilarious.  :-)<br/><br/>Other highlights:<br/><br/>Meeting and chatting with the Evil Hat guys about FATE, DRYH, Richard Dawkins, A Game of Thrones d20, and other topics.  Really nice guys.  I'm a total FATE junkie, so that was very cool.<br/><br/>The panel game design panel on Sunday.  Man, I want to own/play all those games now!  The giants game, the wrestling game, the hitman game, Misspent Youth, the Lost Things/Labyrinth/Homeless game concept.  As with the playtesting session, fun to watch the process.  Great brainstorming and respectful, helpful suggestions flying around.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm going to turn into a convention guy based on my experience at Dreamation, but I am definitely going to somehow squeeze it into my budget for next year so I can come back.  Hoping I can find ways to make it less expensive in '08 though.  Not a cheap weekend, but well worth it.<br/> <br/>Matthew (One-of-Many)                        </div>

<p>Matt, that game was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed your part. I wish we'd had one fewer player. In future, I'll keep it to a max of four Protags and anyone else who wants to play can be audience like I was doing. I was certainly enjoying watching and participating with MinutiÃ¦, so I think that's the way to go.</p>

                            Great playing with you.  I picked up Under the Bed and read it on the plane back.  I'm enthused about both it and Shock and am going to try *really* hard to get both of them to the table in '07.<br/><br/>With IGE exploding as it did, "one fewer player might have been better," seemed like a theme in a few games.  If I'm able to make it next year, I might run a couple games of my own where my only real preparation would be to get the rules explanation down to an art: Shock, Polaris, Shab-al-Hiri, etc.  Take some load off the "play with the designer" groups and still get to play a great game...  That said, I don't think letting Luke in to make with the crazy mad ideas and give people cancer was necessarily a bad thing.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But they're going to need a bigger room for IGE next year.  Lotta games being played in the lobby and elsewhere from the overflow...                        </div>

This was the favorite game of my life.  And you really brought it home when you showed me that the Damsel Messiah had the balls to come to the Khan-of-all-Khan's tent.  I had made the decision to destroy the city if you didn't.<br/><br/>But you did, and that gave the Khan a reason to stop what he was doing.  You saved the world.  Terry saved the world too by convincing Oghma's apprentice that the world was more important than her desire for vengeance.  Jenskot was just baddass to play with--a truly worthy foe.<br/><br/>What a great game and what a great con.  How can I not go again next year?  Thank you everyone!                        </div>

You deserve honor!  I'm a dick for not mentioning you in that last post.  None of it would have happened if it weren't for you and the supplement you penned.  You made <b><i>fantastic</i> </b>decisions as a GM in that game, and having Oghma's apprentice wander off to convince me to kill the Damsel Messiah was truly inspired, because it set up the confrontation between the master and the apprentice, which was the climax as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>Just please tell me that the recording came out!                        </div>

                            My Burning Empires game in which Lisa Padol bared her breasts to her husband and offered her life to clear the stain from his honor -- which was her rape by his best friend! Rob NJ demanding that his character be impregnated then arranging for the fetus to be force grown with experimental tech. And finally, Nate, in the last scene of the game, calling down the freaking Inquisition on their asses.<br/>

I need games like that to maintain my faith in humanity.                        </div>

                            Yes, I was honored to learn that you adopted my character (a kid with a German father and a Polish mother, who got polio, and whose father then left them, who hated all Germans).<br/><br/>Someone else decided that Lena (a German girl I created earlier, whose trait was "selfless") was the one who was pregnant in the chapter.  I decided my character had impregnated her.  Someone else decided that yes, that's fine, but also: she's "selfless" and has "helped" a lot of boys.<br/><br/>Did I mention I like collaborative RPGs?                        </div>
