It's easy to focus in on particular areas and flesh them out, and the change logs make it easy to track and coordinate changes as you make them. Obviously cross-references can be hyperlinked, and various other organizational goodies. <br/><br/>As a consumer of the rules (in the process of being designed, of course) I found it an excellent reference, but somewhat difficult for "internalizing" the rules, since you couldn't just 'read straight through' to get a handle on everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior" title="14thWarrior"><img alt="14thWarrior" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.netflash.net/llanade/BHG_Avatar_Sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior">14thWarrior</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287169/#Comment_287169" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T09:09:58+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:09AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In recent years, I've been doing virtually all of my design by Wiki; though my design workshop wiki is locked down as a private wiki accessible only by myself.  I've been designing this way so that I can work on my games from any internet connected computer.  Whether I'm at work doing design during my lunch hour, or at home, or at someone else's house borrowing their computer, so long as I can get online, I can edit my designs, or jot down an idea really easily.<br/><br/>As for finding a wiki... You could start by doing a google search on "free wiki sites".  There are lots of them out there.  I haven't used free wiki sites in years, so I'm not sure which ones are best anymore.<br/><br/>If you already have a web domain or personal webspace, or don't mind sinking a little money on getting a domain or webspace hosted, you could set up your own wiki.  There are a number of good free wiki softwares available.  The one I use for my own website and workshop wiki is <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki" rel="nofollow">DokuWiki</a>.  It's a fully text based wiki system, so no SQL database is needed; and it's easy to set up, is feature rich, and has hundreds of plugins available to extend its capabilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
