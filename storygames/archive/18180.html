These cards have different results ("Yes, but..." "No, and..." and similar) that are interpreted by one of the players.<br/><br/>Sometimes this breaks the flow, especially with the more concrete cards ("You need help from someone else to make this happen"). In a playset I'm working on, ALL the cards have concrete effects - someone loses or gains a resource, a good or bad plan/inspiration comes to someone, etc. People need some time to think, which can be a little frustrating since they know people are waiting to see what happens in the middle of a conflict/exciting scene.<br/><br/><i>I'm looking for ideas to make this more fun. </i>Possibly ways of eliminating the problem; ways of making it not feel like a problem; ways of changing the explanation of the rules or perhaps the wording of the phrase so it won't be perceived as a problem.<br/><br/>Do you have any ideas or suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410527/#Comment_410527" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T03:36:16+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  3:36AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs this would be much less flow-breaking if players got to choose when to incorporate the information.

It also takes control over my character - from freeforming narrating to suddenly having to adjust to a game mechanic. What the rule does is for someone else to narrate the outcome, which I can see the point with. When we played Archipelago, we sometimes created an obstacle by using Try a different way or Describe that in detail. I think that is enough, to be honest.<br/><br/>The person who invoke "Try a different way" should include something that needs to be fulfilled in the new description - "Include how you're breaking your promise", "I don't want to end up in jail" - or a consequence of the action if the current players chooses to go through with it: "You will be known as a traitor to the kingdom". This creates the same thing - another player has control over the outcome - but it still includes the current players decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410533/#Comment_410533" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T05:24:21+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  5:24AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think sometimes a little interruption is worth it to process the new direction the scene can take and doing the card justice.
