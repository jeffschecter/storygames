The Dying Earth vibe depends on espousing a sesquipedalian style so much of the text is written thusly. On the other hand, the core rules are kept simple and this makes it easier to understand them.<br/><br/>I'm not sure it's simple words that are the issue with games. I can cope with complicated words and I have a dictionary for the rare occasion when the meaning eludes me. To be honest, I don't even know what a simple word is. "Set" has more meanings than any other word in English, is it simple? Antidisestablishmentarianism has one precise meaning, is it complicated?<br/><br/>If I have a problem with a game text it's usually one of these other reasons:<br/><br/>1. the writer is not used to writing an instructional text. They don't have a clear idea of the order of things before they write them down. They put in more than one idea per phrase and there aren't enough examples.<br/><br/>2. the writer assumes too much on behalf of the audience.<br/><br/>3. the writer makes obscure references - some games even have references to forum posts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216162/#Comment_216162" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T05:23:18+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  5:23AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2009 5:28AM by Graham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK. Those three are different issues, so let's not discuss them here, but start new threads if you'd like to.<br/><br/>Various roleplaying texts have text I find difficult to read: Vampire The Requiem, Sorcerer, lots of Game Chef entries. Lots of long, complex, Latin-derived words. There seem to be a variety of things going on:<br/><br/>1. The writer just uses language like that.<br/>2. The writer never talks like that, but when they write, that's how they write.<br/>3. The writer thinks that style of writing is the best way to communicate.<br/>4. The writer is trying to assume a high-flown literary style, perhaps because they think it suits a genre, but it actually comes across as impenetrable.<br/><br/>Of course, such things are partly a matter of taste, but it's not all that. Long sentences and complex words are, generally, less readable. They're appropriate in academic papers, because there's a whole shared vocabulary, but if you're writing a text to explain a game, simple words are simpler.<br/><br/>How I can make them stop?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216163/#Comment_216163" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T05:34:27+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  5:34AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2009 5:36AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Did we jump from "perceived as more intelligent" to "the writing is easier to read" already?)<br/><br/>Sorceror is not an easy text to read but I don't remember that having much to do with the vocabulary.

Using "big words" generally gets you greater precision, at the cost that some people won't understand the word.

Games, however, have at least three cross-purposes that I can think of and each has different requirements:<br/><br/>* a pleasant read (wit and order)<br/>* an effective instruction manual (order and clarity)<br/>* an effective reference tool during play (clarity and landmarks)<br/><br/>...and so playing with the language ("wit" here) has to take a back seat because it only serves one facet of the game's purpose, and arguably not the primary one. Consequently a lot of my most agile writing gets clipped in the editing stages so that the game works.

If you can talk about Foucault's responsa to Kant's subjective purposiveness without a purpose vis a vis the burgeoning  meta-narrative of bourgeois culture in the post-modern ennui... well, you are awesome. <br/><br/>However, when I write for a non-academic crowd, that same sentence does not give me credit. Partly it is because of the perception (which is not completely false, by the by) that I'm talking big for status -- I'm inflating my argument in order to sound smart. (The underlying message is "I'm SMART!" as much or more than whatever I'm trying to say about how art has changed over the past two hundred years.) <br/><br/>A lot of generalized audiences want a text that implies mastery not by the author using big words or challenging them, but by a more zen-style mastery where a true master should be able to explain things simply. Certainly there is a place for saying things like "the dominant paradigm of intertextuality is..." -- its when you're still trying to work out difficult ideas yourself. But, according to much common wisdom at least, once you actually deeply understand what you're saying at a master level, you should be able to explain it much more simply. "A lot of people these days seem to make sense of movies by watching other movies..." <br/><br/>I'm tempted now to ramble on about the socio-cultural reasons for this, but I shan't. Graham would yell at me. <br/><br/>Anyway, much as I might not always agree with this, I think there are some lessons to be taken from it for the writing of games. When I find a game text that is written with that level of mastery where the author seems so comfortable with what he's doing that he can state things simply and directly, I usually enjoy the text more and have more respect for the author. You can often see some level of this between the first and second edition of a game, where discussion, absorption, and reflection have given an author time to really understand things that they were trying to say without mastery the first time. <br/><br/>Hell, I think this is a primary reason why folks from time to time beg Ron to rewrite Sorcerer. When you read Sorcerer you get a real feeling that Ron was still figuring things out, or that is to say he knew what he was doing, but not to a level of mastery where he could always communicate it clearly to a general audience. When you read stuff Ron writes about Sorcerer today, however, a lot of that is gone and he's able to talk much more directly about it. <br/><br/>So, anyway, to boil it down: I think that when we write RPG texts we need to think about our own level of mastery over our material, and how it may be effecting the choice of words and rhetorical structure that we're using. Sometimes it may be necessary to use technical or complex language -- but why and when? Are we doing it to say "I'm SMART" or "I'm INDIE" or are we doing it because it really communicates something that less technical words wouldn't convey? Are we using the terms to obfuscate the fact (perhaps from ourselves more than our readers) that we may not be clear about exactly what we mean ourselves? (Like, how easy is it to say, "Narrativism" as a gloss past the actual structural procedures that produce story in this particular game?) <br/><br/>If we're writing for status, if we're writing for a particular audience and want to mark the text as "for this group only," or if we're writing on a high level that we may not have mastery of yet but that we think we either won't get mastery of without a public release (this is what the ashcan front was for, in a real way) -- the elevated language is probably appropriate. It does, after all, serve its function there. But when writing for a general audience and trying to actually communicate procedures, I think that clear, common language as the default will probably serve us better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216218/#Comment_216218" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T10:30:30+00:00" title="July  3, 2009 10:30AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I prefer simple words by default unless there is a deliberate and effective reason not to use simple words.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften audience will influence word choice and what is appropriate. But as information becomes wildly available, who your audience is may expand. Many who don't speak the same language as you and will rely on translations. Writing simply can help this process. Or your audience may speak the same language but it is their second or third language and using unnecessarily complicated word with no added value can cause confusion or put up a barrier to entry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have friends that enjoy putting up barriers to entry for those wanting to read their writing. But simultaneously complain about their lack of exposure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I love the subtle differences between certain words and their implied meanings.

(The exception being professional academic writing, where the complicated language is part of an agreed-upon jargon, and failing to use the torturous syntax and obscure vocabulary your peers do will make your paper <i>less</i> readable and useful to them, not to mention making you look like you're not qualified to discuss the subject in the first place.  Or so I'm told, anyway.)<br/><br/>Simple language has the advantage of being direct, and it frequently sounds authoritative.  It's a language of facts, of directions, of confidence.  It implies that there is no confusion or ambiguity in the writer's mind.  I can absolutely believe that simple and straightforward language makes most readers sit up and say, "This person is smart."  When you ask an expert a question and get a direct, complete answer, you feel better about his or her expertise than you do when you get a lengthy, roundabout answer full of hemming and hawing.<br/><br/>Complicated language has more shades of meaning and is, I think, more lyrical and beautiful.  It may encourage or resemble the hemming and hawing of a non-expert, and consequently make the writer seem less intelligent and confident.  For some kinds of writing, I think that's fine: novels and poems and personal correspondence are different animals from scientific papers and news reports and manuals.  We read the first group for pleasure, and complicated language won't necessarily disrupt that; but we read the second group for knowledge, and that's when we want to feel like the authors know their shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217587/#Comment_217587" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T19:36:47+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  7:36PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Authors: you don't have to choose!

I played in an epic 4-year d&amp;d 3.5 campaign that he ran every other week in his lab.  Gaming materials are kept in the "secret drawer of mystery" which grad students were expressly forbidden to glance inside, but which was always kept unlocked.  Results were predictable (and given that Danny is a psychologist, likely part of his diabolical plan).  Grad students or faculty who entered the lab during games were solemnly informed that the polyhedral dice were being rolled for the activities of our "statistics and probability group," but this ruse may have been undermined by the giant brightly colored AD&amp;D GM screens...<br/><br/>At any rate, Danny won an IgNobel for this research, and was invited to their awards ceremony to be honored and to make a speech.  They expected him to make a long, boring speech, and so planned all sorts of distractions, loud noises, etc.  Danny got up to the podium, and made the following speech:<br/><br/>"Hello.

Using long words for the sake of it, just to make yourself look smart, is a big no-no. That's the kind of practice that will make people think you're a smart arse. You have to use a word that is not only correct in its meaning, but also one that sounds like it fits with the words around it, and the overall tone of what you're trying to say. Most of the time a short word *will* be better than a long one, but that doesn't mean you should dumb down if a longer word expresses the emotion and subject better than its shorter siblings.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
