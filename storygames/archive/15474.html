Is it going from talking to punching to pulling a gun, as in DitV? Is it simply adding a new danger or threat to the scene? Is it just making the current task more difficult to succeed?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K." title="Ethan K."><img alt="Ethan K." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2475/3619178655_cd765940c5_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K.">Ethan K.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351029/#Comment_351029" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T11:07:54+00:00" title="December  9, 2011 11:07AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2011 11:08AM by Ethan K..">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it's most useful to think of as an aggressive implementation of the "Yes, And..." principle from improv. Being focused on escalating means that when my players seize on an idea, I do too in a way that drives the story and pushes them to conflict. There's an example from my last game of Lacuna, Part 1 that seems useful:<br/>\n<br/>\nThree Agents, in pursuit of their Hostile Personality, have stumbled into the Black Zone under his lair. It's a dark, shadowy catacombs. I throw out aesthetic details that seem to complement this: rats, a body slumped against the wall, etc. One steps over to investigate (signals interest). I describe the man, his stab wound, his missing eye, his tattered clothing. The Agent asks him a question. The man lunges for the agent's throat (normally, we would build to aggression, but it's a Black Zone and everything's dangerous here).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe take turns advancing the narrative and throwing up flags. It's tense, their heartbeats are high, they're on the trail of a killer, and it only makes sense to escalate to violence and conflict whenever possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351032/#Comment_351032" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T11:18:05+00:00" title="December  9, 2011 11:18AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a bit about escalation a couple of years ago, I invite you to take a look: <a href="http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=260" rel="nofollow">2006-10-05 : Escalation</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351047/#Comment_351047" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T13:44:23+00:00" title="December  9, 2011  1:44PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great essay there.
