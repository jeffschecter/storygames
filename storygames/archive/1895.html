Personally I don't know why Erick landed there, rather than <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://bb.bbboy.net/shadowsofamber" rel="nofollow">Shadows of Amber</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps he wants to reach the kind of gamer that RPGPundit attracts.                </div>

                            Hmmm. Interesting.<br><br>The few (single?) post the Erick posted on TheRPGSite made it clear that he was enthusiastic yet wary. It's been up for days and no posts from The Man yet, but it's probably just because he's busy (on a trip to Shanghai, it appears). We'll see. I'm interested in hearing about his new stuff that he's been working on. Maybe Ben has some insights for us on those projects? <br><br>Personally, I love the Amber discussion I've seen on other sites, especially RPGNet.  I pretty much gave the game a total miss (although it was insanely popular at my best friend's college in the mid 90s) until I saw how TonyLB and Michael, Rob D among others pretty much lived and breathed that game for years. I have gotten a lot from the discussion and actual play threads here and over there. I would still be wary of running it, but I'd love to play it at some point.<br><br>As for why Erick plopped over there... I dunno, had anyone actually <i>asked</i> Erick to post on the Shadowlands? He might not even have known about it, or been asked. For all Pundit's flaws, he is genuinely enthusiastic about the game and about Erick's previous works, so his love for both made it a natural fit on those forums (as well as a good chance to promote Erick's works). Plus, he asked him. There's nothing strange about that, but I guess we'll have to wait and see about the tone on that site.<br/><br/>As for therpgsite in general? ...I actually got tired of reading Abyssal Maw posting S-G threads or posts over there to "deconstruct" (read: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=EISdUkG8Bbw" rel="nofollow">Kangaroo Court</a>) them that I finally just went ahead and put it on BlockSite for a year or so, see if it gets better (actually constructive about... anything?) or worse (the site continues to be an extension of Pundit's blog, and dozens of griefers atlking endlessly about how much they hate RPGNet and The Forge) by this time next year. I got tired of the "Us vs You" mentality, the "rhetoric", the attitude and cock-swinging. Things can change over time, though. I'll tune in in a year, hopefully it'll be less "HATE! WAR! TESTOSTERONE!", at at least more middle-man participation which drowns out the noise.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I am going to follow the fora for the time being.  I'll respond to the threads that interest me, and ignore the ones that don't... just like I would with any other forum.  I can even ignore the entire rest of the website, given how the subscriptions work.<br/>
<br/>
Given how Amber is an EXCELLENT example of modern Forge design theory before there was modern Forge design theory, I'm interested to see RPGP's take on it.                        </div>
